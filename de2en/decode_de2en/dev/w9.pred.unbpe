gutach : even more safety for pedestrians
you are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 33-pedestrian traffic light is opened in gutach at the village parking lot - within the view of the older town hall lights .
two plants so close to each other : intention or turnstile ?
this question was clearly answered yesterday by gutachs mayor .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it secures the school path , &quot; eckert explained yesterday .
the kluser-light traffic light is a safe place for cyclists , bus passengers and mountain residents .
the plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the crossroads of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pedestrian traffic had to add another traffic light to their safety &quot; , eckert says .
peter arnold of the offenburg council office confirms this .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 transports approximately 12 000 vehicles daily to the municipality of gutach , of which around 10 % are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; arnold points out .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is just the way forward &apos; , arnold says .
in total , four transport shows had been carried out , and a circle of traffic was also planned , but because of the close in the kreuzbachweg / kirchstraße intersection .
according to arnold , the traffic light poles had been tested out before : &quot; with an extra for us with particularly long trunks of load-bearing trunks , we tested whether these vehicles were taken from the sulzbase .
the traffic light system itself , which costs around eur 15 000 , is the &apos; most modern thing currently available on the market &apos; , explained arnold .
the complex is equipped with coloured leds , which are so bright that the lights are shifted from the drivers , for example , even in the low sun .
and it is also economical : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light systems per direction .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian pushes the traffic light , the upper radar sensor will test the traffic situation .
if the road is free , it will immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go by road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safe on the road , &quot; arnold said .
of course , the driver must think along the road as a partner and observe the driving path .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green , a class car rashed through - at shining red .
josef winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the plight of his childhood and youth .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the lack of voice , the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the closeness and the lack of joy - have made the carinthian poet more frequent .
the büchner prize winner is known primarily as prosaauthor , theatre texts are in his rar work .
collage from prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; weather lights on the tongue &quot; , which is now in garage x at st. peter &apos;s square , therefore a collage from prosatexer .
the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot; the beigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from &quot; leichnam , his family bewitched &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirement : a crumbling buckled sofa , on which there is a hint of copulation and masturbation - hangs the eight-head .
director fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70-minute performance is a perfect addition to the template with a wealth of government injuries known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .
the actresses in particular are the most important actors in the sometimes questionable scenic transpositions .
they are hard-hit , dipped with their heads under water , with their dust tapped to the wall .
impregnated with cellophane or bodice , they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .
the text , however , is hardly conveyed in this hard-hitting way .
the best moments has the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from deep purple to folk music .
the overshot performance is only a little calm towards the end , and winkler ’ s downright absurd humor is striking .
a blackbox in the car ?
us road planners are looking for a source of money to stop the declining highway system , and do they believe the solution in a small black box to be found in the fitting box ?
the equipment that records every kilometre of operation and reports the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning offices of the states to dismantle the obsolete system for financing us roads .
the usually boring area of road planning suddenly has a intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarians have allied with environmental groups and are arguing that the government should use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled – and possibly even where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax .
the tea party is horrified .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay for each mile they fly .
thousands of drivers have used tachographs , some of which are gps surveillance .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only possibly use , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of the southern california asnn , of governments that have a record of the risks .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , financed from taxes , is killing the americans at the tap .
but in america , the tank is no longer as much tank as it used to be .
cars use less petrol .
the government mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not dare to raise taxes even by a cent at high fuel prices .
“ the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tachographs to collect a milestone payment system .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long run , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it mile based user fees .
it is not surprising that the idea has received popular support from urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california ’ s planners rely on the system to develop strategies that address the ambitious , legally anchored goals of the federal state on climate change .
but republican bill shuster from pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , also declared that the country would not accept the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of relocating drivers after a long distance .
“ this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of reason guidelines .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former american transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on congress to move toward mil-based accounting .
last year , the us senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project , which would have included 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the push , responding to the concerns of rural mps who represent people who are living often in many miles on the road to work or in the city in everyday life .
several states and cities are nevertheless moving in their own direction .
oregon , currently holding 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country , is the most committed .
these drivers will soon be paying mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , to which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently investigating the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where 50 volunteers have recently been equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” alauddin khan , head of strategy and result management in the ministry of transport , explains .
people did not want it .
when the test was running , the aclu warned of nevada on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to convert the tachograph into full-grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that inevitably uses to create a data base on the daily movements of individuals .
nevada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to travel the kilometres travelled , but not exactly when and where .
so , khan argued , the public would be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has made some authorities a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally involved in helping states to tax drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for motor insurance in an emerging market , where drivers are expected to earn miles based on the miles they have travelled .
but the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with gps and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .
&quot; people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , &quot; ryan morrison explained , managing director of true miseage .
some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon , planners are experimenting with offering motorists a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without gps .
or you choose no device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average of the risks of mileage travelled by all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to rethink the concept of a suspicious public by using the devices with more functions than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay for parking fees , and to pay for insurance for kilometres of road travel , and to transfer speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which you are .
“ drivers would gain a better living by adding value to the benefits offered by the system , ” says a planning document in the city .
some transport planners , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .
the metropolitan transport commission for the san françois bay area was attended by officials who declared that congress could solve the problem of bankrupt highway trust fund .
an additional one-off fee or annual tax could be used to pay drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol to pay for it .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” randy runsentler , the head of the commission ’ s legislative and public affairs , explains .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things .
kings field : small team wacker beats wacker and his team
the voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn main test despite the lack of personnel with flying colours .
only eleven people participated in the exercise .
the division commander hans kammerer had taken the estate of feader in the burgberger straße in his training .
a short circuit should have arisen during sawing .
the resulting fire and smoke have injured two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two breathing protection vehicles of the armed forces made a decision on the matter after the first inspection by hans kammerer .
after a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead them outside .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome .
the building , a workshop with an integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also bales of straw .
there were also electric machines for woodworking .
the first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .
another line was performed by an overfloor hydrant at about 100 meters distance .
now three extinguishing attacks could be made .
the building also used a tube of cavity .
hans kammerer also wanted to show what is meant by little available .
in case of emergency , support is provided through the königsfeld daily operation group .
the commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and companies
on his visit to the breisgau highschwarzwald region , the president of the country , guido wolf , also explained to tititisee , where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the schwarzwald development centre , he went to the university of hamburg together with the managing school directors of the vocational schools and the district school of gymnasium and the parent advisory board chairmen .
&quot; education is an important location factor &quot; , claudia stelle , director of the hans-thoma school , emphasized the networked school project education center hochschwarzwald .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the waldstadt district has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre .
he also praised the family-friendly atmosphere in the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a view of the family phase , but also to have a period of care for relatives , due to demographic change , &quot; wolf explained .
he also stated that more and more employees are concerned with the care and care of their relatives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wolf .
but no one can afford to lose skilled labor , he continued .
another , particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .
&quot; for whoever has known the region &apos;s advantages during his studies remains with his acquired knowledge and skills often the regional economy .
only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met .
in his opinion , the district ’ s location advantage is its advantageous location in the south-west of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
he also experienced the same thing on his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , where he made an effort to develop public transport .
&quot; remain persistent and ensure that the public access to the public transport system is improved , &quot; he said to the local authorities present .
with music a fun afternoon is spent with music .
for 15 years , the kaul family has been inviting the dietinger seniors to have coffee , cakes and afterwards to a vesper .
in the past , the elderly were treated as residents of the resting place .
meanwhile , the st. josef nursing home is held this afternoon .
the residents were delighted with the delicious cakes and cakes .
later , there was a sausage salad .
with popular melodies , silvia kimmich-bantle and her father karl kimmich entertained .
the over 100 years old natural stone wall , which is the front demarcation of the old school court of the church street , which was reconstructed , is to be rebuilt with the rehabilitation costs plan of the city of bräunlingen .
in the days before kilbig , the first works of renovation of the front school courtyard were performed with a small angle wall , which was used to stabilise and relieve the static load of the over one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .
the next step , according to alexander misok of the bräunlinger stadtbau , will include the state monument office in the planning and will provide a rehabilitation plan for the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation will be carried out by experts who will then be able to report to the local council to decide and decide on the way forward .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
after the renovation , paving and planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , a follow-up action must be taken in the foreseeable future to remove the wall from need .
the historic , one hundred year old bridge of the old school of kirchstraße is connected mainly by water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , which needs to be remedied and has a curve .
deep cracks in single stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a firm wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which has been done by the current fortifications .
originally , the school ’ s renovation was planned in 2008-2009 , but large unplanned spending brought a postponement .
an important word in the historical restoration of the school walls , which was even used for film recordings , will be given by the state memorial office .
if there are any requirements from this site , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monument preservers .
the students of the bräunlinger primary school , who are now back in a well refurbished old school building with a new aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to receive jazz training in stuttgart .
the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in baden-württemberg have now also been followed by cem özdemir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to include holistic education in the musikhochschule stuttgart , &quot; said özdemir of the &quot; stuttgart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are a part of the jazz festival in stuttgart .
this contradicts özdemir , who was chosen for a direct mandate in stuttgart for the federal elections on 22 september , who was the green and red state government .
this is pushing for a new order of the five music universities in baden-württemberg , based on an expert study .
the programme will then include jazz and pop from the musikhochschule stuttgart to the musikhochschule mannheim .
u.s. border : &quot; super-tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling discovered
on the mexican border with the usa , investigators have found a &apos; super-tunnel &apos; for drug smuggling and have closed down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metre long pipe between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and an air conditioning system .
three suspects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated .
the tunnel was not yet in use , according to the information .
&quot; these cartels are stupid when they think they can dig through under the radar , &quot; said the us district secretary general southern california , laura duffy .
insured doomsday to drug gangs said : &quot; if you continue building such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are engaged in a permanent battle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , mexico has had more than 77,000 people killed in the context of drug crime .
designed by experts
the tunnel &apos;s complex features make it difficult for investigators to assume that it is being used by architects and engineers and that the construction is going to take about a year .
the track system was equipped to allow electric cars to be used there .
on the mexican side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads to the depths of the tunnel to the actual entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres in height and 90 cm in width .
it would have been a good idea to promote illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for the seizure of marijuana .
all three face the threat of life imprisonment as the maximum penalty , as officials said .
eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , as stated at the press conference in san diego .
it is the first time , however , that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
cocaine is usually produced in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .
this demonstrates the &apos; despair &apos; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sherman of drug flagging dea in san diego .
they would do everything to get to the us .
no details have been given to the detainees , at least one is mexican , they said .
they must be given prison sentences of up to ten years .
in 2014 , geisinger will be celebrating the 2014 year of the year
the anniversary of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the first mention of the town is coming closer .
if the year ends in just eight weeks , the anniversary year is approaching .
geisingen and kirchen-hausen were first mentioned together in documents in 794 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as hostages currently have no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time , in the city .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are held in geisingen as well as in kirchen-hausen .
kirchen-hausen will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th the 1250 .
reunion is celebrating .
on friday with a party , on saturday and sunday with a party around the church hall .
the church of the house of the church is also celebrated this weekend .
city music director rudolf barth has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the sonnwendfeier of the schwarzwaldverein , on july 12 in the arena with fireworks and on december 13 as the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is on the last weekend of september , 27 and 28 .
on the occasion of the geising city anniversary , a new chronicle is also released .
&quot; but a chronicle is not only to be made by geisingen itself , but a printed work on the sinking of today , which is simply made of geisingen , kirchen-hausen , fingers and corpses &quot; .
and the geisingen of today also celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 the present space was completed with the associations .
the new chronicle is due to be held on 21 or 22 november in the new festival hall in geisingen .
2014 is also another year with many jubilee .
the narrenzunft strohglonki begins on 8 february with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the feast banquet on 29 march and 4 .
the old leiferdingen plant is 40 years old , the geisinger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on may 10 , the musikverein polyhymnia leiferdingen will celebrate 150 years old in the 4th .
the city of geisingen was given a gift certificate owned by the monastery of st. gallen in 764 .
the document was produced in churches ( hausen ) , which was then a court .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .
reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year , additionally there is the municipal reform 40 years ago .
rat targets track systems
should the railway crossing be laboriously reconstructed to reduce road safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach must provide eur 220 000 for this .
the deutsche bahn is planning to open up the kinzigtal-bahn line next year .
in particular , safety at rail crossings is to be increased - there are regularly conflicts of trains with other vehicles across the country .
do communities agree to the reconstruction effort , they must share a third of the cost , the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government .
schiltach &apos;s town builder roland griehhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the transfer of the bahrain railway .
the city plans to build a new town in the height of the tunnelmund to the west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those transporting long-wood , could also be in the same position in the case of counter-traffic without having to block the tracks .
greek officials therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city could cross the road that followed it in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed controversial in the local council , as some councils have questioned the need for road traffic : thomas kipp , by saying that he had brought the sentiment of critics to the point : &apos; do we have to take so much money in the hands because of so few vehicles ?
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; is used regularly for long-timed transports .
even wood from the area &quot; kuhbach &quot; is transported in part over this route , because the vehicles up to 20 metres long do not use the route at the häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a route for those vehicles that do not have to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argued that haas .
as it is to be expected that kirchberg and schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and rebuilt , as is currently the case in wolfach , the railway crossing can be extended for a longer period .
the councils agreed to investigate the costs of the intended widening of the road .
despite this , the majority of the members agreed to restructure the railway transition , with the proviso that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city can use the road leading to bahnhofstrasse around 5.00 where appropriate for encounter traffic .
the conversion of the railway line at the gerber trautwine could , on the other hand , cause a completely different problem , which would make access to the rapidly increasing &quot; warm-houses away &quot; .
the administration had taken over the railway conversion plans from the engineering office in breinlinger , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the fortress office would be possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclude the fact that the road &apos;s inclination ratios could lead to longer vehicles being put on hold .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road construction loader .
the conversion could therefore result in disputes regarding liability .
as both the logging and bending are in the current state of construction , the conversion of the railway line should not be agreed , the hammer argued .
the risk of a collision of the train with a passing vehicle is also much lower than that of other railway crossings , because the next stop is the mitte stop .
even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down to the point where no collision would occur .
the majority of the members voted against the reorganisation of this railway crossing , as the city of schiltach &quot; uncovered the problem with vehicles on its seats &quot; , according to the councils , since the railway was taking responsibility for the construction work .
the board considers the rebuilding of railway crossings &apos; before heubach &apos; and &apos; before kuhbach &apos; , which already have crossroads agreements with the railways , to be unproblematic .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of dollars
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will have to start in the coming years .
thirty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .
the selection is difficult : should you look for gravitational waves ?
or would you rather explore the source of the cosmos ?
or to search earth like planets and thus perhaps discover alien life ?
these are the questions that the leaders of the european space agency , esa , are asking themselves .
for your program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make decisive progress in research .
the budget for these &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the elite of european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were on the table , five of which have now been put to the vote .
numerous committees have assessed the proposals to make sure that researchers are not in trouble .
a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee in the next few days .
a total of four major questions have been selected by the esa , on which the missions of the cosmic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?
the exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
in order to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; is to be launched in 2017 , which will enable 500 already known planetary systems to be examined in more detail in our immediate vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , and cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map earth planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , looking for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered indicative of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue too should ultimately provide an indication of the conditions for life to be created .
magnetic activity of a star plays an important role , and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation it produces with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be explored in an exemplary way .
the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; has already sent the esa a mission of the m-class ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) to this issue .
the probe is to start in 2017 and monitor the surface and activity of the sun closely .
the research is also very interesting for jupiter and his moons .
you want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa sees the first of the three l missions of the cosmic vision programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter was to experience the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to control matter under extreme conditions and to study it in ways that make the natural laws we know valid there .
perhaps there are also deviations that would pave the way for physicists to develop a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe arise and what is it made of ?
our cosmos was created by the big bang 13.7 billion years ago .
in addition to the familiar matter , from the stars , planets and living creatures as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gravity is galaxies and galaxies cluster , and dark matter .
so far , researchers have not known what physical laws have been adopted in the first fractions of the big bang , nor have they seen any evidence of dark matter and dark energy .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the esa has already approved an m-mission in this area , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
a special telescope is used to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
anyone who could do the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .
the best chances of obtaining an l-mission is , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , an ambitious concept for proving gravitational waves .
this means physicists making changes to the spatial structure that albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proved to this day .
elisa could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission is to identify a detector consisting of two or three probes that is stationed in space .
unlike plants on earth , it could also detect gravity waves that are visible in the big bang , creating new insights into the formation of the cosmos .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a large x-ray telescope called &quot; athena &quot; , which includes black holes .
proposals for prototyping repatriation from mars , research into mond , venus and asteroids are already out of the equation , and for solar physics .
snowden ready to cooperate with germany in terms of us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has said that he is ready to go to berlin and to promise to the german bundestag when the us national security agency and its president are not in charge .
the german mep , hans christian ströbele , met snowden in russia on thursday , where he received asylum in order to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which sent to the media in berlin on friday , ströbele wrote : “ even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government is treating a dissenting opinion as continuing to be treated .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter snowden writes that he is convinced that support from the international community will convince the american government to suspend the charge against him .
the accusation issued by the us justice department includes espionage and theft of state property .
the german interior minister , hans-peter friedrich , said to time online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to talk to german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us-germany relations are burdened by the claims that the nsa has taken chancellor angela merkel ’ s mobile phone off .
thomas oppermann , the member who has led the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness , if that is possible , ‘ without jeopardising him or her , and strengthening relations with the us . ’
ströbele , a member of the greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was visited by two german journalists .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former nsa employee snowden could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snowden in germany say , then he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the member says .
snowden says in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that would take him out of his homeland .
it is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply concerned about the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance .
in his letter , snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the german authorities “ if the problems surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines charges handbaggage fees for baggage .
frontier airlines plans to receive up to $ 100 from passengers travelling on their flight .
frontier airlines intends to pay up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade , even though the announcement on wednesday said that it would not be available to passengers .
the new fee applies to cabin baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , while small bags below the seat are still free of charge .
frontier explained that if the fee is paid in advance , you will be charged usd 25 and usd 100 for passengers who arrive at the boarding gate .
frontier spokesperson kate o &apos;malley said the fee of $ 100 targets to encourage travelers to move , to prepare for payment .
“ we don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second piece of baggage checked in in in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore lost as much as possible in their hand baggage , which has resulted in the baggage compartments being frequently overfilled .
charges are a way of encouraging passengers to take on board less .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loyal customers of frontier , who would have made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the platform of frontier may have to carry one piece of baggage with him for free , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they can go to the boarding gate .
the new frontier hand baggage fee will only enter into force in the summer , and no exact date has yet been set .
passengers often complain about baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines like to use them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers pay this service when they leave the baggage .
many on wall street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most of them , however , have been fingers of hand baggage charges .
spirit airlines inc. was the first to demand handbaggage charges three years ago , and later allegiant air , also a low-cost carrier , followed .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , explained the airline consultant jay sorensen , who follows the additional charges closely .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the spirit handbaggage fee could bring in $ 50 million annually .
sorensen , who formerly held a senior position at midwest airlines , recently joined spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth i have seen in my career in aviation .
i expected to be teeth crackling and handy discussions at the boarding gate .
&quot; the plane was full , &quot; he said , &quot; and boarding was running like lubricated . &quot;
frontier also follows spirit for the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers travelling with lemonade or juice could keep the whole can and have coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
in 2008 , us airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks , but made it back seven months later , after passenger passengers had complained and had no other large company .
frontiers has taken the step of imposing charges on hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline , is the latest initiative to link customers to their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 usd per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to encourage passengers to buy directly from them , rather than through an online travel agency .
frontier has gone furthest in this area , however .
in september , the company began to make reservations through an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles .
on wednesday , miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .
a flight reservation booked with a third party provider with frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers can also only buy directly on the frontier platz website .
frontier has a loyal customer base in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
the proceeds were down 9 % and the flight capacity was down by almost 13 % in the first quarter , as the financial report shows , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airways holland .
republic has tried to use the company &apos;s sales to improve frontier &apos;s finances .
proverbs come from the bible
more than 40 women visited the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; medieval phrases &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the council of church communities , went to the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast .
&quot; proverbs contain lifestyles , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
it compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible sites and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs like : holzzzauge is vigilant , as dandruff falls from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his own , the lord in sleep , wash his hands of innocence .
the speaker has also advised the audience to know what proverb it was .
the phrase from the middle ages was taken by the parish councillor , christel dehner : all good things are three , blue making , something hewn up .
it explained the meaning and origin of the phrases that they called &apos; bridges to the past &apos; .
a raffle was raffled at the end .
the prices were placed on a table and were humorously enumerated before being handed over to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the mayor candidate roman waizenegger also blended .
learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for unskilled in tourism
the region was founded in 1883 by the pilots of the mecklenburgische see lake district .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry are expected to become experts in hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees , &quot; said carmen wiechert of the labour agency neubrandenburg .
the benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would be trained professionals , the companies would become increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce and industry in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( dehoga ) mecklenburg-vorpommern .
nsa declares that it is an “ internal error ” and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website .
the shadow national security agency declared on late friday that a bug had caused your public website to paralyse for a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was unreachable for a few hours this night , because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explains the espionage agency in a message sent by e-mail .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a denial of service attack ( ddos ) performed on a distributed basis is not true .
in the early evening , online server trackers had noticed that the nsa website had not been reachable for at least six hours and that this is still not possible for some users .
previously , a nsa spokesman had told abc news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not compromised in any way . ”
secret information is not in danger , the speaker said .
at least one group of hacktists claimed to have linked the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple , and attacks do not serve to interfere with the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no such agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public and looks at the known events in recent months .
the growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .
the number of people without a job fell slightly in october by 22 to 1,307 .
although the 3.1 % rate is better than last year and better than in september , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; monika felder-bauer , deputy director of the business agency , says .
many companies have reacted to date with recruitment .
one reason for this is , according to felder bauer : &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft sector , in the health sector and in care for the elderly &quot; .
the number of jobs for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector has been increasing since september , due to the seasonal conditions .
the winter season begins in mid-december .

winning losses in bombardier after delivery and orders declines
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc announced a 15-percent decrease in net profit on thursday after he had been forced to withdraw from the market by declining orders and deliveries for third quarter aircraft .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand new cseries aircraft , nor did he give any new information as to whether the aircraft was in line with the ambitious schedule next september .
the flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago was followed by only three more start-ups , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .
the results were below the forecasts and led to a fall of more than 8 % on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , reduced his evaluation on thursday of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” in view of the fact that the share will be in the next one to two quarters .
“ although weaker delivery numbers were expected to be as high as possible in the case of aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” doerksen said in a customer ’ s letter .
we believe that bombardier should be given new orders for cseries when the testing program for the aircraft progresses .
if you do not receive any new orders in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the aircraft crew of the cseries will take the company to the lower market segment , which is currently being exploited by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and flew for the first time in september after months of delays .
but so far , binding orders for the cseries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings are zuesensing .
currently , there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve his 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the company management confirmed on thursday that the program was in the schedule for analysts and media .
“ the test aircraft has stopped on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s life ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then add a review period , which we have done .
this is done throughout the entire programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining aircraft shortly thereafter , it was said from the company side .
yet analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer can take a cseries aircraft into operation .
bombardier explained that it is reviewing the start-up planning and will be planning to update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it is clearly bombardiers of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is limited to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerkner .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bombardiers ’ net gain fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share , a year .
the adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents .
sales decreased slightly , from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that it has issued 45 aircraft this quarter , a drop of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace division was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was therefore unchanged compared to 31 december .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were within the framework of our specifications , but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector amounted to usd 32.6 billion on 30 september , and was thus slightly higher than 31 december .
the profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , there will be new presets for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoon-day trading on thursday , the bombardier share dropped 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the google finance executive , patrick pichette .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers of the closest rival , announced a 10 % drop in quarterly profit on thursday .

cocaine advocate-advocate-general , the drug boss warned against police investigation , must be imprisoned .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to subworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .
he was awarded the liverpool crown court for three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who had a drug baron warned against a major police investigation because he was afraid to see his secret drug addiction revealed was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in the drug trade , after having been replaced by its own cocaine search .
the “ first-class ” praised lawyer by criminalists with the nickname “ bash ” was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police scarborough overseen .
officials observed scarborough ( 32 ) discarded three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , who had been killed with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer &apos;s bar .
the investigation revealed that ditta regularly uses class a drugs , after the tests spurred traces of cocaine in its hair , on its wallet and on credit cards .
for a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to disclose unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were arrested by the police at the time in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police had heroin and cocaine in a series of house searches worth £ 1.5 million , and gbp 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be published .
today , ditta , who is responsible for the firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , was awarded the liverpool crown court after a three-week trial in two dossiers for disability .
he gave a previous survey on cocaine ownership .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been involved in their investigation of scarborough , and in february 2011 , they were sent by telephone to dietta .
two investigating officials followed the suspect and saw how he could become ditta &apos;s house and use drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .
shortly after he had delivered the drugs , scarborough made regular telephone calls with ditta , who was at the dinner at the blackburn rovers football stadium in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , took drugs and then nine fellow communications were sent between the two .
in court , ditta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing class a drugs in its hair , its letter tags , and its credit cards .
ditta was arrested later , but refused to take cocaine and said that he had been indulged in talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and claimed that his discussion was not open to discussion .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to collect a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hairsample .
in the case of police interrogation , he said that he was operating an office and client services under both his private address and the workplace , and that clients would call him at home for legal matters .
it became known in court that he was a major player in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , and had called for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone that the law cannot be broken . ”
ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he has been too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he acted as far as possible in the police investigation , so that they could continue their criminal activities .
mr ditta brought his profession into disrepute .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed that “ if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and that i would pass on information to scarborough , i would not wait 15 hours , but would wait . ”
but after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said of the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he started to start drugs .
his cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromising and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who endowed him with the collection of valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .
ditta has lost that confidence and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit of lancashire led the investigation of ditta , who also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had conspired to heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trafficking .
thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade have been sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published a section of questions and answers about itself on his website , where he stated that his dream job was to be a lawyer in the death penalty cell in america .
revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebrations for the occasion of its 160-year anniversary , the song crane dunningen will offer two services of worship with the &quot; deutsche messe &quot; by franz schubert .

on saturday , october 26th , this exceptional fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. martiniskirche dunningen and on sunday , october 27th , from 10.15 at the church of god in st. john .
the so-called deutsche messe ( german fair ) , with the original title &quot; singing to celebrate the sacred victim of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer franz schubert from 1826 .

haslach : skepticism is moving toward confidence .
the elections to the parish council in 2015 will , for example , bring about a change in the soul unit haslach ( se ) .
there is only one other parish council for all six parish councils .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the haslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach bodies prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the diocese can no longer be changed and the parish church of the parish councils must be able to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new soft but increasingly confident .
we are still a long way from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , and the extremely constructive discussions between the six bodies and the main officials of the ministry of the sea .
regional dean georg schmitt explained the new guidelines for sea organs in the erzdiocese by means of a presentation .
after that , the se haslach church community will form a public law body that will be included in the rights and duties of the six individual church communities that have so far been divided .
there will be only one joint parish council and one foundation council , in which the parish council will have office .
at least two elected members from each parish are to be represented , and in the six parishes so-called local community teams are formed .
their task will be to make the church life in the village more attractive .
when it comes to the finances of the individual parish , there was a great need for dialogue .
the innovations provide for the transfer of collected funds into the parish for purposes .
liabilities , on the other hand , extend to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the major investments planned , the obligation of which then affects all parishes , that there were great concerns .
&quot; in the past , too , only projects were invested in which the individual parishes could manage alone , &quot; relatised haslach &apos;s parish church council , president bruno prinzbach .
practical experience with a joint body for five parish portrayed barbarian ritter , the chair of the body in the wutterwald-neuried .
they had set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , staying five &apos; in 2006 and found that this is not so easy .
the bodies of the haslach soulkeeping unit then set to discuss the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work will be given concrete shape in subsequent meetings and will be presented at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the parish council michael schöner from steinach presented the new logo of the soul unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is becoming more expensive .
the citizens of pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the city ’ s works , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south courier , a four-person pfullendorfer family will pay a supplementary fee of 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called ec levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is annually implemented by the four operators of the large power lines in october .
these figures are the ones that will be incurred by the change of energy that you will have to pay through a levy on the price of electricity .
the municipal works of pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .
in its forecasts , the supervisory board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias reported .
the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works next week inform their customers of the exact price increase .
&quot; we are moving from a 1 cent plus x increase , &quot; says bias , where the number is closer to the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : wait until the first stop .
sometimes a traffic light just doesn &apos;t green .
the contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light sign is broken .
what can we do then - drive in red ?
if an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stuttgart lawyer ralf beecker explains in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which varies from case to case .
becker advises to wait at least five minutes before starting to cause a functional disruption of the traffic lights .
if you continue the ride despite the red lights , you must be aware that it is not responsible for an accident that has been caused .
if you have your patience for less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , becker warns you and refers to a decision of the upper regional court of hamm .
in the case negotiated , a driver had to leave the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to sign up for a negligent red offence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but jumped to green a little later .
he was not allowed to travel because of the special situation - but the fine was not .
municipal council is pleased with sound budget
whenever local councils are concerned with the budget , mayor ralph gerster laughs well .
the municipal bag in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and debt has not been in the administration since 2005 .
the 2012 budget year can also be said to have been a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around eur 7.6 million was higher than a million .
the budget surplus was also around 1.8 million euros , and around eur 1 million was above the level of the approach .
the surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the local share of income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million that was earmarked , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to higher access from the administrative budget , &quot; said rothmund .
since less investment than planned has been made in the 2012 financial year , the return provision has also been higher .
overall , the overall reserve has been reduced by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for their good work .
&quot; you don &apos;t shake a work like this out of your sleeve , &quot; commended gerster with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were obviously delighted with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon pay dearly .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to avoid high levels of hobby in the past .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
for these subsidies from various compensatory pockets , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and communities applying for grants must submit certain lifting propositions .
&quot; we need to look at the issue of lifting , as investment is in the coming years , for which we would like subsidies , &quot; gerster announced in this context .

the male singing association betra also sang classical choir songs like &quot; hunter spells &quot; by julius wengert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hubert goisern and the folk song &quot; .
the song cranes salzstetten created a unique atmosphere with its mixed choir and women &apos;s group - the &quot; impulse &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed choir kidnapped with the neapolitan folk &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; by antos cus in foreign countries , during the &quot; impulse &quot; also returned to foreign languages .

kenyan press outrages at controversial media law
“ we are in a frightening position and one may wonder what parliament thinks of simply calling tomorrow the judicial independence of the european union ? ” was the subject of the newspaper that published the draft law .
“ the law is draconian and very punishable , ” cyrus kamau , ceo of the capital group , said , including capital fund .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would have made kenya ’ s position in the global economy harder .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking a cudgling role by means of the new law , “ the media effectively in a stranglehold ” , which stipulates that democracy and freedom of speech in kenya have suffered “ a severe blow ” , and that “ drag . ”
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at ensuring national security following the attacks by armed islamists on the west gate shopping centre in september .
the kenyan media have attracted the authorities ’ anger by publishing images of security cameras that could be seen to show how the people who were sent to the scene supposedly had been the luxurious shopping mall .
police chief david kimaiyo responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate , even though the subpoena was revoked after a cry from the media .
under the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million kenyan schillings , and individual journalists can be held in a position of up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or of losing their professional credit or of an official press accredits .
the tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ a single penalty can put most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”
the newspaper also believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as the “ lively blogosphere ” of kenya .
if you silence the media , politicians could do without punishment whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know , ” mutuma mathiu wrote , a journalist at the nation that described the kenyan media as a decisive factor in public control .
&quot; if politicians are left to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and collectors , &quot; he commented .
kenyan legislators have already , in the past , been attracting public anger .
in may , they voted to renew the rules of procedure imposed by the national compensation commission , and continued their defensive salaries from around eur 532,000 to schilling tax-free per month .
bad-dürrheim : a dream becomes true for the fc 2009 .
the city and the football club were not the only reason for the official opening ceremony for the kunstrasensportplatz despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant party had probably all wanted last saturday , but peter wanted to not play with it .
so all those who had no umbrella or who had a bad idea for any reason could not keep such a thing .
this was to the musicians who framed the festival , just as many speakers .
nass was also the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
his thanks were mainly due to mayor walter klumpp , who has been very committed to the implementation of the project , the local council , the companies involved and the members of the association involved who have intervened .
here is especially lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .
the rude pensioners laid 400 square metres of pavement stones for the new paths .
this remarkable volunteer commitment also honoured the landtagsmep karl rombach .
further greetings to the municipal sports committee hubert baier , the district leader of the southern baden-football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr of the planning office , the german planning office .
mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn were attributed to the original lawn so that it could not be played .
as long as 15 years ago , the first thoughts were given on solving the problem when the construction of a third place at the football club or at the real school at the salinensee .
both have been discarded .
six years ago , there were thoughts about setting up an artificial turf , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were launched two years ago , when the fc had leased the label-shop in lease , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the square and the country received funding of eur 104 000 .
the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros , in october 2012 , and the lumpp combined .
the construction of the 68 x 108 meter artificial turf square was started on 4 june .
during the construction period lasting over three months , 3000 cubic metres of soil were degraded , half of which were used for the construction of a dirt bike route .
the union and the spd have concluded their coalition negotiations on the issues of justice and home affairs .
the relevant working group met in berlin in the morning .
it is about direct democracy , corruption of members and the federal police .
this morning , the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliberations .
one of the issues that should be addressed is dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd wants to avoid the pressure on immigrant children born in germany to choose one - the union rejects a double passport .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda for this friday , the spd has underlined its &apos; no &apos; to a car toll requested by the csu .
a vignette is a &quot; flatrate for the long run and therefore environmentally counterproductive &quot; , the spd negotiator explained on the subject of transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
there was a risk of evasive traffic on roads that are already the main areas of concern for accidents .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be only a first step from the point of view of pronolds .
&quot; there is a danger that compensation will be paid for germans at a later date , &quot; he said .

vienna airport provides passenger calls from vienna
mr max maier , please come to gate 24 .
it will be possible to say how this will be done at vienna airport in the future .
a large part of the volume of the loudspeakers is lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spokesman peter kleemann announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows with the recruitment of individual people surveys , an international trend .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai are already refusing to make the noisy calls .
by abolishing these canals - on average , around 200 personal calls are heard in a day by the speakers - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; experience has also shown that these individual breakthroughs were perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flights or departures has been slightly lost here &quot; , says kleemann in the conversation .

sleepless in new york
on the way to your host families in weymouth , massachusetts , students of the schwarzwald-gymnasium met the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , we went straight to brooklyn bridge , which is the heart of the city , manhattan , on foot .
a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline , which was built in the evening light and which attracted a lot of visitors .
the time delay meant that the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but true to the motto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day was decided on at times square .
despite shutdown , the statue of liberty was reached on the second day by a ferry and could be climbed on foot .
the financial center then went on to commemorate the 11th of september .
on the third day , the students could enjoy the 373 m high viewing platform of the empire state building .
after that , the hectic hustle and bustle of new york streets went through the rockefeller center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to spend a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students have now arrived in their host families and experience the world of the school at weymouth high school .
this year , the name of saint hubertus will be celebrated again in the parish church of st. marien on the hulsbergstraße .
st. hubertus was a ruthless hunter who was driven by vision and later turned to bishop of lüttich .
the hunting horn breeze group of the westphalia hunting tribes , under the direction of brigitte kluth , is musically dressed on parsons ( natural horns in the mood it ) according to old french melodies originally .
the veins wear riding clothes because they are mainly horse-riding , horse-riding and hunting dog .
the festive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opschlag shines with a new cafe .
one that invites you to stay and come back .
one that wants to make the name the program .
déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon , according to lexicon , which manifests itself in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the event of the visit of the café at the opschlag in the district town of kleve , in view of the university of rhine-waal , it does not have to remain pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has the very aim : to make a real stay not only mentally but also hand-proof and recurring .
because it &apos;s fun and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look into the inner life at opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away .
the ultra-modern , but not cool , café-ambience looks like a place to feel at ease .
here the team spoils with the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top of the team with a variety of coffee and cocktail variations .
there is also a delicious cake or a freshly prepared baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the charming cafe at opschlag as a gastronomer : in kranenburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kleve to the opschlag , the friendly cafe lovers will be greeted with more crowds .
not least , through the university .
&quot; while we do not have a specific target group , &quot; daniel büttner emphasizes .
instead , the two students here want to address the same as senior citizens and all ages between them .
speaking of café-lovers .
the friendly owner pair stands behind the coffee enjoyment .
enjoy the smells of hot brow in different variations .
expressofan
daniel büttner is rather the expresso fan and mirjam van der stett the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; i would like to add a baguette - that is my thing , &quot; she tells the nrz .
two events were already taking place in the bright café .
better said , one thing .
the harbour festival was held outside - café déjà vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the ringelnatz evening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , found the two 33-year-olds .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a fan of event evenings either : &quot; you can &apos;t miss it !
and with an event i always talk to those who also have an interest in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should it be : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in kleve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klevers , guests from close and far , and students who enjoy the gastromile and therefore also the café déjà vu for themselves .

a day of thanks to mgv in dinker
it was the 165th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; ( german society for the foundation ) which was celebrated this year with 52 guests , active singers and their wives .
the restaurant &quot; witteborg &quot; in dinker enjoyed all the hard work of the harmonious coexistence , in the name of music .
traditionally , the festival of foundations is also the right festivity to hold honors .
the special award &quot; singer of the year &quot; was a pleasure for the writer rolf wagener .
&quot; you have written a lot for us , but have also done some rounds for us , for which we would like to express our sincere thanks , &quot; said the chairman of the choir erich schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples by means of activity shrubs went to the choir leader dieter schulze with 44 attendees , followed by the honorary horst pier-choral chair .
the first place was placed in the category of artur brückner .
one particular thanks was addressed to the board of directors to the team of club owner ange pier-ribbert , who once again created a menu of the very high class and sent to gerda pier-ribbert for the table decoration .
the mgv &quot; friedrich-wilhelm &quot; meets his regular choral samples every tuesday at 7.45 pm in the club restaurant .
&quot; we are always welcome to hear new voices of santiago , &quot; schlotmann says .
un proclaims new goals in the fight against poverty
the united nations is now starting to work out a series of new objectives to address the millennium development goals announced 12 years ago in order to combat poverty .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing “ sustainable development goals ” that will drive the millennium development goals that expired in 2015 .
they were included in the final draft document drawn up by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the evening ’ s summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to start a process that will allow universal access to human rights and to promote sustainable development , ” he said .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .
i will spare no effort to support this proposal , which has been given to me by the member states , in order to realise our vision of sustainable development goals , which is based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days of the match , the handball upper ligist still has a good mood .
this is what coach tomasz malmon leaves no doubt about .
all of them remain fully motivated .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i don &apos;t know how a victory tastes like that anymore , &quot; malmon expects a success experience from his team at the vfl fredenbeck ii .
even though the third league reserve from fredenbeck has not yet demolished trees , malmon is raising the issue of alerting the pointing finger in advance .
i have met many players in the a-youth .
they will therefore certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .
&quot; it is also important to see if there is some reinforcement from the first one , &quot; explains the sg coach .
to finally return to the purest of success , the malmon team must be more flexible than the previous appearances .
above all , in the coverage work and the shift game , it was really huge .
there is also a need for better use of opportunities .
i hope that my players will finally be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and the power of the democratic republic of mozambique .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder of the state and first president of mozambique to call for peace at a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the country ’ s future , she has put her business clothes against a t-shirt with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has settled on the thursday of crowd in the independence square of the capital .
for two weeks , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and renamo almost daily , which are one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially led by the white ruled rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of south africa in an effort to discredit the country ’ s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and domestic worries .
a lot is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because discovering huge reserves of gas off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like rio tinto in the next few years .
the ruling frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and renamo blame each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by invading its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when renamo bases in government attacked the rebels and tried to discourage afonso dhlakama , who had been the leader of the group .
the government blames renamo for the clashes , and blames the organization for attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .
the commission has said to afp , the french news agency , that on wednesday dhlakama felt that he was “ losers ” who “ had lost all his remaining forces to help prove that he was “ a man . ”
both frelimo and renamo stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga was quoted as saying that renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement .
he told the ft that he meant that frelimo had no longer respected the agreement .
“ our vision is to reopen negotiations and to do so seriously , ” mazanga said .
earlier discussions between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults here ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who are gathering heads together , ” says joseph hanlon , dozens of open university students and mosambis university .
none of them is well in the negotiating process , and none is willing to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .
some commentators have described the use of force as an attempt to offend a ailing movement , to make concessions and financial concessions by the government .
renamos has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , led by a former renamo member , was building movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , will probably improve in elections .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – will destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” mazanga says .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has not allowed troubling attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometers north of maputo , but is located in beira , the port , the mining companies such as rio tinto and vale .
in june , rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after renamo announced an attack on the track .
mazanga reacted cautiously to the question of whether renamo will repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things in mozambique are not going well , ” said mazanga .
instability has fueled the frustration over the government , says fernando lima , director of mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people were already worried about corruption , slow progress , and lack of confidence .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in renamo and frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads again , ” he explained .
children should be seen as “ models for life ” for myths and legends , an author says .
the stories of thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance of being against clever tricks , ” and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why crossley holland argues for “ careful education . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that , for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disconnect completely ” , because in entertaining stories , the messages would “ subside ” convey .
crossley holland , the beowulf from the anglo-saxon and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk valleys , said : “ you can follow certain things .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is that of the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or brought to a happy end , but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil .
this must be subdued , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hansjakob is again drawing in freihof
100 years ago heinrich hansjakob took his retirement home in haslach , and on sunday his last years in the &quot; freihof &quot; became alive .

with her song &quot; o jesulein &quot; they enjoyed the public in the freihof as well as the storchentagskinders with their loud &quot; out , &quot; out .
his criticism of the church of the state of hansjakob was as vocal as his concerns about the agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind its tomb chapel on fire at hofstetten , he found his retirement place .
&quot; a restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever , &quot; it was said at the end of the game of scenes .
much applause and many praiseworthy words were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the hope of neckar giants grows .
the chances of remaining a league for the sporty , downgraded ludwigsburger bundesliga basketball team have increased .
if there is a wildcard procedure , there is no longer any money for the neckar giant .

such a question could be resolved between states , it was said .
a trip from snowden to russia is virtually impossible .

two huge blue shredder and recharging devices are distributing or distributing coal as needed .

&quot; the signals are for safety and are legally required &quot; , says matthias schrell , managing director of rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
in the event of unfavourable winds , this is unfortunately widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the people concerned , says the 40 year old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of softening the warning signals with technical measures .
he will continue to work in open dialogue with neighbours .
matthias schrell has a lot to offer at the site .
the expansion of the lower saxony bridge continues to place rhenus midgard on the import of coal for power stations and is one of the major players in europe in this sector .
thanks to the mooring tub , which is deepened at 18.5 metres in front of the terminal , capesize bulk carriers can be processed here for a long time .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope , &quot; schrell says .
besides the eon power station on the ground , import coal is going to power stations in the inland .
if the gdf suez power station is to be connected , a good 5 million tonnes of coal imports a year would be realistic .
the three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million .

ben greenman : ten years new york comedy festival : the new york city festival : the new yorker
it could be said that new york city was the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : nearly a hundred years ago , the artist frank fay , who was known as conférencier at the palace .
over the years fay &apos;s innovation has been expanded , as was the latest at the new york comedy festival .
founded and managed by caroline hirsch , the founder of the stand-up institution carolines , the festival will be celebrating its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs .
“ most of these headliners started with carolines and became more and more successful until they became known to be in a club . ”
we have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with you .
at this year &apos;s event wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher and “ booth up for heroes ” , a yearly music and music festival .
the festival also marks the beginning of the world of comedy .
a number of comedians attending this year &apos;s festival are more familiar with unconventional ways , such as small and medium television broadcasts such as comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was known with a sitcom on cable tv ( the ironic-slippery fantasy football series “ the league ” on fxx ) and now has his own sketch show .
jenny slate was present at both saturday night live and parks and recreation .
both croll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , based on race themes ) .
the biggest magnet of visitors to the festival includes an interview : david steinberg talks with larry david .
steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has developed into a prestigious television and film director and an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 he was the host of a television programme entitled &quot; sit down comedy with david steinberg &quot; on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of manhattan .
“ the city is definitely in the comedy dna of larry ’ s entire work , ” said steinberg .
he told me when he is here , then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : hey , if i lose all my money , then perhaps i live here .

drama in uruguay : young killers of game compartments with machete ,
two children have been murdered in uruguay by a 11-year-old .
the two young people , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their sacrifice to go bird hunting with them .
armed with machetes and knives , they invaded the 11-year-old tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the newspaper &quot; el país &quot; on thursday .
they would have been able to play football before their homes in a working quarter .
the corpse was discovered in the following night in the village cerro pelado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive punta del este beach .
an alibi should be a five-year half-sister of the younger , who had taken them with him , saying that she had been sexually attacked by the young .
when the girl was unmentioned in front of the police , however , when she described the crime without mentioning an attack on her , the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .
the reason given was that the elderly called , among other things , a rivalry in the football game .
he was provisionally transferred to a psychiatric youth institution .
pimps must be put in jail
the exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimples , threats , insults and dangerous body injuries have resulted in the district court of konstanz sentencing a 33-year-old man from st. georgen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german military soldier , who was appointed doorstewards after two operations in afghanistan , set up a confession in a process agreement .
so in five cases he has met women through internet or telephone contacts , which he had to revisit in the net after a few weeks against their will .
he used to break resistance with violence and threats .
the income of women , who have been earning for him for some years , has been retained .
by confiscating mobile phones and sim cards , he underlined women ’ s contacts with the outside world .
together with a colleague who conveyed the women , he brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
there he left some of them to monitor their revenue .
the defendant claimed in court that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in afghanistan had been killed alongside him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert had serious doubts about mental restraint and thus about a limited ability to blame , the 33-year-old submitted a comprehensive confession .
the court had to stop hearing any of the women who had been injured .
as a kripo official reported , after a first notification by telephone surveillance measures , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified .
the intercepted talks had been marked by high aggression .
in later interrogation , the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another female female witness , who has blue spots on the whole body , has not yet made any statement .
it is a &apos; completely broken personality &apos; which is exploiting violence and exploitation in this profession as a normal thing .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has dissolved from these circles and , after detention , wants to lead a normal life , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to $ 96 per barrel .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after worries about high supply overshadowed a report that china ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference crude oil variety for deliveries in december was in europe late morning in electronic commerce at the new york mercantile exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 usd per barrel .
the contract fell by 39 cents on thursday , which represents a 5.8 % drop in the october price .
the large range of crude oil has been a burden on prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us supply increased by 4.1 million barrels .
over five weeks , the offer had increased by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports of an increase in chinese production activity .
this suggests a continued recovery in china ’ s economy , whose growth is attributable to 7.8 % in the third quarter , after the fall of the us dollar in the previous quarter .
crude oil from the brent variety , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by us refineries , is falling by the ice exchange rate .
court blocks the decision to stop and frisk of the nypd
a federal appeal court in the united states blocked the order of a judge on thursday to make changes to the stop and frisk program ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the second us court of appeal declared that judge shira scheidlin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on the appeal of the city .
the judge had ruled in august that the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the programme for stopping and questioning people was implemented .
the city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered , including the decision to set up a monitoring body to monitor the police in changing their directive and the relevant training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments on tuesday about the suspension that was being called for .
the appeal report stated that the judge must be discharged from the case , as she has adopted the code of conduct for us judges by specifying that a judge may have the appearance of partisan ;
the judge had ruled that police officers were injured with the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unreasonably targeted in targeted black and latin american men with the stop and frisky programme .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms of directives , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot programme to be carried out with cameras carried on the body in districts where most controls were carried out .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of storing names and addresses of people who have been repatriated after police control .
an oral hearing on the vocation of the city is planned after march 14 , 2014 .
the stop and frisk tactics have been used by a number of civil rights defenders .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of the partisan mayor michael bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , and most latin american men in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities brought a complaint , which became a collective action .
advocates of changes to the nypd stop and frisk program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way in which other governments operate .
opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morality , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to leave thousands of posts in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had to stop and frisk practice .
the happiness of the dreaming camels
happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels succeed .
with this bedouin wisdom , the first chair wolfgang henne described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the tenth anniversary of the association &apos;s birth was celebrated , which has already had considerable success .
the first chair , mr henne , spoke in detail about the association &apos;s work .
he himself was the first time in mauritania in cheijk-zajed hospital in nouakchott in 2004 .
as a result , another cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips .
during the speeches , images of the inserts were shown on a large screen , so that guests can enjoy the jubilee event from the mentioned actions .
the desert vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
rainer prewo , the former ob of nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to work with the association in advisory function , according to henne .
in 2008 , the zimmerrei schleeh from baiersbronn took over the hospital in socogim , a misery quarter on the outskirts of the capital , honorary work .
henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in nouakchott .
especially interesting at times when the birth clinic wegrabikt is to be moved .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical doctor , according to henne , for example descendants against burn-out .
the country ’ s political unrest has not allowed it to travel as many as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to get hospitals in various areas .
in addition , containers with material are sent to africa regularly , so in march this year medical equipment , medicines , association material , hospital beds and glasses .
the co-initiator hans-joachim fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local coloration by producing a variety of wines from mauritania to the mobile goat barn .
when his personal motivation was he called his work in the area of auditing as a young mep .
when he realized how much money was lost on the road , he decided to help africans control a budget by the people .
fuchtel also stressed that global economics requires global human love .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
gran canaria is not far from africa .
coulson used phone hacking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor andy coulson supposedly put “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to get a false tip about an affair by then home secretary charles .
public prosecutor andrew edis qc told the court in the old bailey , news of the world had a false rumour in may 2005 that clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser . ”
the newspaper commissioned glenn mulcaire , a private detective , to investigate pawlby ’ s voicemails , and persecuted them , but coulson also called them and left messages behind .
“ in the opinion of the public prosecutor , coulson , who is now the editor of the notary , is not anyone who stands before the home of people and hopes to catch them in fresh deeds , but one that is people .
he said that notw uses three methods to investigative stories : phone hazards , surveillance , and confrontation .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the first ?
does he know about the phone hacking ?
he is arguing , but we say , “ and if he knew of it . ”
rumours of an affair clarkes were first heard by the feature editorial team of notww , as a source that sexually transmitted to pawlby , was said : “ don ’ t waste your time .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the detective computer on which pawlby and her sister were labelled “ projects ” .
in the time when the research was running , the grandparents of pawlby received anonymous calls calling in which they were asked for information about them , edis explained .
meanwhile , former chief reporter neville thurlbeck and the former former reporter of jack weatherup oversaw the surveillance of pawlby ’ s movements .
on june 18 , 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
edis explained that coulson &apos;s activities at this story followed the same pattern as other major personalities , such as former home secretary david blunkett .
the jury heard on thursday that coulson blunkett was accused of an affair with a married woman when he himself was facing the covenant rebel .
coulson and brooks are fighting to have conspired with others between october 3 , 2000 and august 9 , 2006 to hack phones .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have announced the telephone hacking .
in protest against the planned tax on the empire , french football will indeed be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting will end without results .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and professional football in france have resigned after a failed dispute over the realm tax .
president françois hollande received a speech at the paris élysée palace on thursday , representing associations and members of the association , and also heard their complaints .
he refused to play football from the planned 75-percent margin .
the other side , too , remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of november will now be passed , the chief of the professional club ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , announced .
the agreement reached between 29 november and 2 december in the ligue 1 and ligue 2 is therefore out .
gechingen : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage &quot; , opened mayor jens häußler the citizens &apos; information event on the flood protection concept in gechingen .
about 80 participants had arrived in the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and come up with ideas .
skidler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the local council &quot; .
the floods that hit on 15 may 2009 , unprepared , were a drastic event , which had raised the question of protection measures for the future .
a river basin survey was conducted with the neighbouring town of aidlingen , which now forms the basis of the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many built-in plots as possible is the goal , &quot; said häugler .
the planning is based on the protection against a german weather service statistically every 100 years expected floods .
climate change is being put on the table by a 15 % supplement .
in experts , this is done with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that caused significant damage in gechingen in 2009 amounted to a 1000-year flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement &quot; , says häußler .
to protect the hq 100aklima , you have to pay around four million euros in gechingen , with local grants to the community of about 70 percent .
but chieftain pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented .
the community must therefore be able to count on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
at best , implementation could begin in 2016 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the local council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of river irm from the parent valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took advantage of the opportunity to bring their concerns .
one of the questions raised was why there was no more dams and back-pads planned to protect the place .
gregor kühn , the specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office wald and corbe from hügelsheim , emphasized that it is the interaction of all the measures presented that are required to achieve the desired sum .
moreover , it is necessary to find the most economical solution , according to joachim wald von wald and corbe .
discontent reigned among the altorts ’ living-parties , who , even in normal storms , were constantly suffering from overload of the channel network .
the problem is known to the administration and first steps have already been taken .
but the house of commons pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different from those for flood prevention and that this should not be mixed up .
the municipality is obliged to design the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration could be overcome .
the sewage channels to be larger would devour millions .
serious injuries after the collapse
on friday afternoon , on the provincial road 44 near revensdorf , two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .
the police immediately closed the street completely , but could not say much about the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .
what is certain is that the 19 year old guide of a vw golf went towards revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf met her with his hyundai .
both vehicles collapsed , with the woman being so hard to hold in , that the fire department needed about half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck .
the actual cause of the accident was not clarified .
both of them went to nearby hospitals .
the track was closed for about two hours .
he could be called the dostoevsky of the us .
philip k. dick was a god viewfinder , a metaphysicist , his novels and narratives also have something serial .
the kinship of the outer is amazing : the stepping eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fjodor m. dostojewski , with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologee of the russian soul , one reads philip k. dick as american prophets .
some titles have been published by heyne verlag , the haffmans cassette with the 118 stories is selling two thousand .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , insecurity , and belief in being chosen .
dick had a divine experience , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has realized that the computers are divinity early on .
he wrote a computer theology and asked what a person could distinguish from a machine , the creator from his creature .
this is the &apos; blade runner &apos; problem .
that is killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have brought film directors like ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg together .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 1956 , it exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunals .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what has become more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick &apos;s world , which resembles our frightening , mutants look to the future - and the police are taking action .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not violated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we grasp them before they can commit a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a criminal with pesudo criminals &quot; , which read flows of time .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented .
dick &apos;s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the interrogation of the nsa .
anticipation of the attack : this is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dicks story is not over yet .
the chief of the police complains that there is no longer any separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
the supervisor will then be monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system is turning through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invents its own preconditions .
does not only accept mistakes and sacrifices , but builds upon them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
reading philip k. dick means constantly getting closer to the truth .
late brothers around merkel in russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden could be more critical in the us spähaffäre of chancellor angela merkel in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar could either ask questions in writing or send questions to the 30-year-old person in russia , the agency interfax reported .
previously , the green bundestag member , hans-christian ströbele , was the first german politician to meet snowden in moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him .
nsa revelations strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance .
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep over the us consulate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s financial capital .
on the orders of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter-terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal intelligence service , he should replace the us outpost ’ s roof , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of wording between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , resigned in september to the us ’ s failure to provide opportunities for foreign espionage , “ to break the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of us corporations .
but since edward snowden , who was named whistleblower , was dismissed by the publication of his horn of fillings to us surveillance secrets , european governments and entrepreneurs have surely not been sure whether they are .
reports that the us national security agency has been using the brazilian oil company petrobas and has obtained data from american cloud providers , including google and yahoo , have confirmed the company &apos;s operations .
the barrel of overflowing revealed that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone had been shrouded , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then it is certain that management is also potential targets .
snowden has strongly supported the close cooperation between us intelligence services and companies .
i believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver green , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us was now almost as risky as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey conducted in july by the beraterfirm ey .
the snowden leaked documents have not yet shown that the european union is not using its trade secrets to the detriment of foreign companies .
politicians have expressed concern that certain it and internet opportunities are lacking in the eu and that they are reducing their dependence on the us .
businesses are sceptical about this .
in the bundestag , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software producer sap .
if we had wanted a strong european it industry , we would not have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
yet , reach and technical refinement have not changed the range and refinement of the us spy authorities revealed by snowden revelations to companies that had previously been the greatest spying risk in china .
cloud computing is undergoing a major change , because european business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the us is not subject to the jurisdiction there , and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a policy developed by the cloud security alliance , a trading institution , the eu ’ s financial markets ’ revelations of the us data mining act were disclosed with prism for about 10 % of non-us data processing operations .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who did not have it a year ago – it is : where will my data be stored and can guarantee it .
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying us on the commercial and industrial level , as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
corporate governance is not normally boasting about the remedies that have been taken , because that gives attackers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long been convinced that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or unattended song is not a problem .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of directors of audi car manufacturers , says that it has been a standard practice for years to gather mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they cannot be used as eavesdroppers .
the german bvt advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when they are travelling abroad , because smart cards are not likely to be compromised .
the prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective niche markets .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access , ” the bvt warns in a report .
the us is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate killed france , russia , and israel in february , second place behind china , among the countries that committed to acquiring economic data for hackings .
a member of the board of a german blue chip company agreed to espionage , then “ are the french the worst ” .
bernard squarcini , former head of the french home secretary dcrl , was interviewed this month in an interview , saying : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they fight against terrestrial .

the teenager &apos;s parents , whose body is found in a rolled ringermatte in the gym of his high school , are convinced that their son was murdered , the lawyer of the family explained .
kendrick johnson from valdosta in the state of the united states of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a upright mat , which was placed behind the grandstand in the school gym .
the sheriff ’ s investigative officers from lowndes county concluded that johnson was not at fault in a tragic accident , which the family of the 17-year-old doubted .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was murdered , &quot; said benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , to foxnews.com.
they would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had torn .
&quot; they believe that there is no logic in opposing the laws of physics and of healthy living .
rather , be convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; your son went to school and came back in the bag of corpses , &quot; he commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that a formal investigation into the death of johnson would take place , as a number of important issues have not yet been clarified .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death a crime ?
moore explained this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , in whatever direction they take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for formal investigation is in place , ” he said .
moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that johnson was not interested in the consequences of a “ position-related suffocation . ”
a second autopsy , however , caused another death , according to moore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added , if there is sufficient evidence for criminal or civil law investigation of the death of johnson , i will not use the fbi for carrying out the investigation .
a representative of the county sheriff authority was in response to our request on thursday not immediately ready to comment .
a court in southern georgia ordered on wednesday that the authorities should review all watch videos .
the teenager parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained indications of how he died .
cdc publish allergy allergy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention published a report on the implementation of a new directive on the prevention of food allergies by children .
these are the first such directives that the us administration issued , as the number of school-age children with food allergies is rising .
one in 20 children in the united states now has food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % , according to the cdc , between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that raise awareness of food allergies to the teacher and the staff and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions .
it is also recommended that schools have epinephrin in stock – the auto injection of the brand epipen is used most frequently – to prevent potentially fatal hyper-sensitivity .
the legislators in the states have recently changed the rules to make schools epinephorine easier to hold .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels like something is pushing my tongue , ” “ my tongue feels like a child ’ s hair is lying on it ” or “ my tongue cribbelt ” .
parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender indefinite ”
germany is the first european nation to have a third sex for children who are suffering from uncertain genital genital conditions .
newborn children are no longer addicted to rigid male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender for such children , but can be “ undetermined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to remove the pressure from parents to avoid making hasty decisions on operations for sexual orientation .
according to the bbc , an intersexual person said years later : “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children does not come into the world as young or as girls every year .
they are among the intersexual , a group that has been diagnosed with “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( dsd ) , a concept of a collective for people with atypical chromosomes , germs .
wallis simpson may have been intersexual .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that you use the best available information to identify the gender .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new german law “ klinge for a good thing ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
&quot; some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but for most children the same is not true , &quot; he said .
you can assign sex without surgery and then wait to see how identity develops .
scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very precise .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is said that intersexual people are affected by transgender or transgender people , because their status is not gender .
these characteristics were reflected in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics , and sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in their professional lives and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .
the young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .
in the meantime , it is possible for adults in australia and nepal to access official documents by male , female , or “ third sex . ”
in june , australian norrie may welby ( 52 ) was chosen as the world ’ s first “ gender-free ” person after a court had called for lifetime maintenance of “ undefined ” gender status .
the german identity cards have a third assignment , x for intersexual , in addition to m and w , in the future .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , as a news story on france-24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
the us catholic online website has also opposed the german law on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where the sex is a decision , then sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then it is two more .
the mother of a newborn from maryland told her about baby zone , she would find it better if babies were to be assigned a gender at birth .
“ parental life is already stretched and stressful without any further restrictions , especially when you look at the sex of your child , ” she said to the parents ’ website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who have been treated with both male and female genital parts were treated as hermaphrodites , according to which attractive greek god , who had both sexes , was born .
as recently as ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child can develop with the infant when it grows up .
“ in the middle of the twentieth century , one was called “ psychiatric emergency , ” said drescher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist who was called , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unequivocal genitals goes back to dr. john money of johns hopkins university , who argued that gender is formable .
he coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental stimulus – as parents have been educating a child – interacted with genes and hormones of a child and thus shaped the child .
but in a report known as “ john / joan ” in 1966 , his theories were controversial and controversial .
he called upon the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off from a boiled circumcision to kill the child altogether and also to keep his testicles removed and then to bring him up as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , ” says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he switched back to the male sex and married a woman .
but he was suicidal when he was 38 .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet , survivors of these gender operations became public , the “ unhappy with the outcome . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36-year-old author from montana who worked with xy-male chromosomes , but who was ambiguous genitals .
the doctors were unclear about whether he was a big clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never have a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external organ and the testicles were surgeon removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 he received female hormones .
&quot; i knew i am not a girl , &quot; he explained to abcnews.com that i am a girl .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastic .
but , since he was depressed , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found out was shocking .
i was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me .
bruce was born with a dsd that could not bring testosteron enough to develop genitals .
after learning the truth , he changed to male identity , received testosteron-injections , and became his breasts .
the operation has made it infertile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california law group advocates for informed. she is also responsible for the lack of information on the german law .
“ many activists are worried that the german decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and give the child “ not fixed ” , she explained .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to have male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organization supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she said .
the german law is about the allocation at birth .
this is not a fight to force small children at this time .
if you are grown up , you can decide for yourself about your body .
but dr arlene baratz , a brussels-based physiologist from pittsburg , who had a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and had supported hundreds of others in a self-help group , says .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete android resistance .
due to the receptor defect of the target cells for testosteron , katie developed female characteristics .
it has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today is katie 29 and married ; she works at the university of pennsylvania as a collaborator in the psychiatry of children .
it is infertile , but hopes to be able to protect a child through adoption or surrogate mother .
“ the law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” said baratz .
it gives you the time to do various tests and to clarify matters and gives you time to be “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way everything is in order – you can take your child big and love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .
and you do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be undone .
“ this includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are being driven around because they think that they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown injuries injure girls by shot
unknown people have a 12-year-old in saxon anhalt in shocks from a car .
the perpetrators probably had a luminous weapon on a group of children in genth. on thursday evening , they were fired with an air pressure weapon .
the police told us that in burg .
the girl was slightly injured at the left wade .
rescue workers brought the girl to the hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was passing by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then drove from it .
the criminal police investigated , it was said on friday .
until now , the police inspection team can expect kempten to have a quiet halloween night .
officials were only given two cases of egg workers who had warned them against house facades .
as homeowners recognized this in time and removed the iron strain immediately , no material damage should have been done .
the city also has a number of new year &apos;s eve balls , but there is no material damage .
a bishop friendly orfer-weg resident reported that his car was wrapped in a pat paper and that his wheel decorative apertures were stolen .
until the police arrived , the man has kept his wheel decorations close to all , so the police can not continue to work .
living with a future
waltraud ries actually lives dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree population , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .
the city is just a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t fear spiders ? &quot; , asks waltraud ries and points to a fat spider at the door .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult it is in stuttgart .
the reason for this is not spiderphobia , but the concern to move the many steps to the house and the apartment in the old age from the beginning , explains it .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the middle-fifties have had to learn at their own peril what it means to deal with handicap from floor to floor .
recently , she published a book on &quot; happy living in old age - what form of living is the best for me ? &quot; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when she was with her husband in the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with fifty center thinks waltraud ries differently about it .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are squeezing it out as long as it is possible .
only the others , &quot; she says , smile .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry .
&apos;then it may be too late , &apos; says ries .
in her book , interior architect presents 17 models of living for self-determined living in old age .
&apos;whatever form of living you choose , however , is always an individual choice &apos; , explains it .
d i e solution there is not for age .
even those who have retired in tuscany or brittany should always be aware that the age of retirement may also be sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also unite in dolce vita , &apos; the specialist book author points out that she is willing to leave .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioner wg .
at old age , everyone has his ticks and makeup , so everyone can have their ticks and makeup .
&apos;for me , such a community of dwellers would be nothing &apos; , she means with an eye winker .
not like a student wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; in old age , you just need your retreat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a residential senior can still work is something that the author does not want to rule out .
this would then have to be different from the classic student club .
and sometimes you just want your peace , &apos; she believes .
it is not alone in the capital of the country , at least .
&apos;most of the old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible &apos; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital .
your department advises people on the subject of &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why it is the elderly who would often accept inconvenience and constraints , just to stay in their familiar surroundings , that is the foundation ’ s experience of product testing .
there are many ways to reach the house or apartment without barriers today .
ries recommends that all those who are interested in the rebuilding of their house or apartment , should first get in-depth information and not be the first craftsman .
today , there are also specialists for the rebuilding of the old age .
even in the rental apartment let yourself realize one or two things , and if there is only the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clarifies .
but the existing apartment cannot always be rented in a way that is suitable for the elderly and therefore accessible , even if it is so beautiful .
waltraud ries had to make this experience .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
she will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband .
before moving , you are greedy more than before the spider on your home door .
the usa wants to prosecute snowden further
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence official edward snowden .
he is still accused of disseminating unauthorised secret information .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state secretary , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change this either .
previously , the german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow to appeal to the us not to punish him any further .
psaki emphasized that stringent statements are those of a parliamentarian and not those of a german government member .
intelligence enthüller edward snowden is always ready to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
that is what the former nsa employee sought by the us in an unaddressed letter that the green politician hans-christian hölbele sent to the european parliament on friday after a meeting with snowden and sent to the federal government .
the letter has been published after a ströbele translation :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am named edward joseph snowden and used to be contracted or directly employed as technical expert at the national security agency ( nsc ) , which is the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and the national security agency ( cia ) .
as i worked in these institutions , i witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government , which led me to act out of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been subjected to a serious and persistent sore which has forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which i have received from the russian federation under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens all over the world , and also senior officials - including the united states - have made the revelations a system of all-encompassing surveillance that nobody is accountable as a service to the public .
these espionage revelations brought many proposals for new laws and directives based on the previously hidden abuse of public confidence in the european union .
the benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the costs of taking these risks have been visibly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my dissens government continues to treat dissent as a breach of faith and to criminalise political expression and prosecute it .
yet to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will take this harmful attitude .
i hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible clarification of the issues relating to the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .
edward snowden testifies by hans-christian ströbele to the fact that he is the first to be a member of the german association of german and european companies .
kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden street sold the commune to a private person .
the municipal council approved the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the municipality is satisfied &quot; , maier emphasises .
the budget was eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner will use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlingen should take responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer be responsible for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , after the garden and to look for the garden .
&quot; this effort is now gone &quot; , is pleased maier .
concert place at high summer temperatures

about 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of hammricher musicians .
the chairman manuela honeck explains the music .
honeck thanked all those who helped to win the first hock of musicians .
report : obama campaign considered to replace biden by hillary clinton .
president barack obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly contemplated supporting vice-president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign with hillary clinton , the new york times .
the revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of mark halperin and john heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ double down : game change ” .
the times is a copy of the book that will be published soon and she reported on thursday evening that the book had been published by the president ’ s top advisers “ at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of times , the book thoroughly describes the history of the campaign ’ s efforts by leading officials and the white house , notably the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including daley , the former campaign leader obama , jim messina , and the former white house leader , david axelrod , and david ploot .
in double down , daley claims to have been at the forefront of efforts to protect biden despite her “ close , personal relationship ” , before being able to resist such a box .
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing biden with clinton .
“ i said a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” daley told the magazine .
it is worth remembering that the president had terrible poll figures at the time , so we thought : “ for god &apos;s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” martin told anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for re-election considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a thing was possible .
“ campaigns do not spend so much money on polls and focus groups unless they are seriously thinking about something , ” martin on ac360 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had an exchange in mind .
martin said to cnn that he asked daley if his then boss had been informed about the potential change .
although daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the political protests of obama ’ s desk had reached .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama has not known anything about the investigation of whether biden was to be dropped in the election .
“ possible , ” martin replied .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail actually means electronic mail .
was used in the design of the internet service email similar to conventional mail technically transposed the letter secret ?
in the conception of early internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical protocols have not been careful to establish a stable basis for hearing-safe correspondence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; benni &quot; sends an email , the hosts of the two are connected directly ?
anna schickt ’ s email program or browser will first send the mail to the mail server of your service provider .
for example , if you have a gmail account , it would be gmail .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that benni uses .
on the track , mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content from his provider .
if conventional e-mails are read through your web site ?
most mails are sent several times by software robots on the way .
the provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail is a malicious program as an attachment .
on the receiver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
in addition , the providers check whether this is a troublesome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least removed in a spam folder .
if the robots have another task , do they have to do it ?
for systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and benni are communicating via gmail about their upcoming holiday trip , google can show relevant links to holiday offers .
read the emails also by unknown people ?
the probability that unauthorized persons read an email is extremely small .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail .
the law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .
in addition , there are possible illegal spying actions .
is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?
with an encryption according to the openpgp standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .
with a high technical effort , it is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
the main privately used mailboxes are yahoo and google , according to a survey by convios consulting from august 2013 , playing only a minor role .
while the shares of yahoo mail had fallen last , gmail could increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest is disguised and retirement is paid .
when his beloved mother died , a man from wolfsburg wrote a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and carers .
to continue to receive pensions and care benefits , a 67-year-old wolfsburger has left his dead mother after police investigation in the forest .
he first saw the death of the 89-year-olds , then he spent the money for more than a year and a half .
now , the 67 year-old must answer for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the man was suspected in may : it was then that the care needs of the mother had no medication needed .
the pensioners told the investigators that their mother had travelled to spain .
because officials were strange , they continued to determine .
the two had been in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had been maintaining them .
the 67 year old finally gave birth to his mother .
the police said that an obduction did not provide any evidence of a capital crime .
would you like to have ice cream that shines in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has taken the first ice cream in the dark , with the help of jellyfish .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of marine animals use and shoot them into a luminous delicacy .
the idea came to him after reading a research on qualms and convincing chinese scientists to use the luminous protein artificially .
the ice cream reacts with the tongue in the process of consumption , raising the ph value in the protein and triggering the light .
chris explains that the ice cream responds to the warmth in the mouth and luminaire – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams for two grams &quot; .
the protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral ph value .
when the mouth warms the protein , the ph value and the ice glows .
we have tested it over the last few months and we thought it was ideal to test it in halloween , because it would not be possible to achieve this wonderful luminance effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever produced , because the qualle luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious for that .
charlies experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavors , including bier , cheese , and rinse meat .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says , “ i would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”
this is in itself impossible because of the breakdown in light caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is made ; but i suspect we will find a way to achieve it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a qualine that is artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is still out of the reach of every point in the handball league after six days of the match .
it is now the very time for ingo ehlers &apos; team to join the derby against the tsv daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season begins again for us .
&quot; i hope that we have finally got our head free , &quot; ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
he finally got the chance to do so , except for the permanently injured hendrik blohme .
like us , this is also a game of speed .
we therefore need to keep our error rate low .
however , the first thing we need to do is to increase coverage , which , at the end of the day , has left far from a certain impression .
daverns coach thomas panitz is much more relaxed after the first season &apos;s victory against nordhorn .
the game was of course a house number .
but that &apos;s why we &apos;re far from the favourite , because everything can always happen in the derby .
panitz , however , now wants to emulate morsum in order to launch a series .
jodat is missing .
the a-youthful joost windsweise , who is playing at the a-jugend-bundesligist hc bremen with double gaming law , is celebrating his seasonal debut .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 :
when i was small , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , stop late and dress up for the neighbourhood .
today i am more a halloween muffle .
over the last two years , i have not agreed to take sweets from my home and i think that this year will not .
but , according to statistics , i am a black sheep when it comes to halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the us association of organizations .
one thing i can focus on every halloween then is the trend values .
the costumes will cost about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting , unanimate items are the last cry .
women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now also enjoy seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as far as men are concerned , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk world space men will put it into the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we had our dogs dressed up and so i was surprised not only .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as far as sweets are concerned , we are not cramped .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
that is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , suckers , candy and rubber bears .
so good news for the us department of commerce , according to 41 million people who are trapped by the sweets or acids saying .
in fact , we will have over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – food .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn ; yet , 15 million kilograms of it are sold halloween , the national association of confectionery producers .
that is about nine billion maize bodies .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more halloween than houses where it is spucked .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which incidentally is in a real prison ) , “ howl-o-scream ” and “ the house of shock ” .
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the united states that earn $ 500 million , america haunts said , and that includes the wonderful photos .
but let us finally get to the cuddling .
charlie brown made us familiar with the big pumpkin when we were children , and carving a shorter lantern is like decorating the christmas tree – something we saw from the small up .
fortunately , the “ baby in the kürbis ” trend only began last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us grew up to cope with the pumpkin and not sitting in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , according to the us census bureau .
the shorter lamps , which slowly rotate in the front garden , are probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of shortened were harvested .
if you want to score points correctly , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and scroll out something pretty from their 921 kilograms .
apartment fire in helmbrecht : rescue workers are buried in coal corpses and have a few carbon-coated corpses .
the fire department had to be in helmbrecht on the late thursday evening .
a three-family house in the hof district catches fire during the night to friday .
the rescue forces have a coalescent corpus from the house .
rescue workers have been killed during a fire in helmbrecht in a three-family house .
whether it is a inhabitant &apos;s handle is still unclear as a spokesman of the police in bayreuth said .
on the late thursday evening , the hotel burnt on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already beating out of a window .
the forces of the army went to the apartment and found the corpses in a room .
this and another room burned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer explained .
the building was not usable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .
background is a possible shortage of priests : the evangelic-lutheran church hannover expects to see the number of their present around 1,800 pastoralists and pastors declining according to current law by 2030 .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to determine the workflow and the daily routine .
with burfien , the provincial church for the first time has entrusted a pastor on a full site to enthuse young people for theology studies .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology after graduating .
burfia leads this back to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can focus where it is important to me .
pastors could be close to the people as a soulbearer .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well from them .
certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
this is what is happening to the young people of today , who are not only concerned with careers , but with a work of a kind that is full of meaning .
according to the local church , which comprises three quarters of lower saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .
at the same time , some 40 graduates of a theological studies begin their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland , or wendland , it could be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
burfien wants to organise study days for young people and to invite prominent people to study theology .
theology studies offer a broad range of training .
it can even become the federal president .
land rover rally series announced
the interior features racing seats and six-point belts , as well as a hands-free system .
the options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with support for bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , explains : “ the rally customers who come to bowler have changed . ”
you are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and looking for an attainable way to world-class events .
we are pleased to be able to continue this path in partnership with land rover and the msa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for the different rally disciplines in the uk and abroad and for newcomers to experience .
we really enjoyed playing the defender challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .
in addition , there is a training program for the defender challenge in february and the option to participate in desert races in north africa and the middle east .
fire brigade to save a bitch , 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock protrusion in a quarry .
cockerspaniel bitch ruby was out of the road after a small traffic accident .
three days later , she was taken by a walker in the quarry in her peculiar location .
fire brigades rolled down to a cliff and saved the dog from the safe death of the dog .
the fire department managed to keep a dog safe , which was on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .
the nine months old cockerspaniard bitch ruby was in the air after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she left a stone quarry on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire to meet ruby again .
they desperately had their missing female and they helped to get help in social networks .
around 2 : 15 pm on wednesday a walker who saw his dog was walking the crowded and the stranded ruby on the 15-meter high paragraph in the quarry .
cleckheaton fire station technical rescue team rushed to the site and rolled out to rescue rubys .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was in the middle of the cliff wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff-frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then gave a few cakes to her dog .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a giant accident . ”
it was possible that she was seriously injured or worse .
ruby was taken to the veterinary surgeon , but he did not find anything except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ watch out for rescue was frightening . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion became too great and had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the firefighters have done great work .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keithley added : “ we were afraid that she would fall down , but she stayed up . ”
the firefighters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger explained that he never made katy perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been playing hunting song as a background-singer of jaggers song “ old habits die hard ” from 2004 .
perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker , and that “ he drew me away when i was 18 ” .
she added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative jagger , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach katy perry . ”
the representative added : “ maybe she confused him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling-stone tour this year .
her new album „ prism “ was released in 1st place this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice of a new europe .
a new day , a new story of horror about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scotland is needed to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the hadrianswall. the story is a story of the past .
in fact , the strthclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that would allow greater freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was , as expected , in the headlines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often comply with their strict rules when it comes to making it cheaper for them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , continued non-compliance with brussels would be a small concession in return for what is really being demanded of the scots .
so really not a story .
and one that has already come so long that it is already similar to a fossil : for the first time i have called the &quot; independence means passport control &quot; -duck at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is that the repetition of this ancient history is lost .
why expect an independent scotland to be able to operate under the european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great plan to unite europe after the war has stalled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties that are anti-eu or that regard the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party alternative for germany – founded only this year – could win barely five million votes in the september federal election , effectively destroying free democrats ( the equivalent of the us .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .
because of the strict rules imposed by berlin and the european central bank in connection with the straitjacket into which the national economy is being driven by the detention of the single currency , many people believe that the project is far too far-reaching for europe .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive fiscal deficits – which was only the case in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has sealed its members ’ exchange rates , which are beneficial to german exporters – and german politicians would like to leave that as it should .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself at a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to germany .
the only way to cut wages and public spending is to use the spurred berlin initiative .
behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper european productivity problem .
as a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by brussels – a code for subsidizing french and german energy companies at the consumer ’ s expense – european industry pays a great deal of extra money compared to the united states .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have seen in greenmouth .
all wage fixations in the world do not protect the european petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the eu ’ s former cheerleader .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to help germany in its wake and to bring paris to the same level as washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has put its own economic policy on hold , which is the grip of the ailing french economy .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-eu front national has just won a decisive post-election , thereby weakening the ruling socialists to third place .
the front national is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party that it does not expect to be divided in the right wing .
what makes le pen with its newly won popularity among the white french of the working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very much possible – then such a block could be the dominant position in the european parliament for the first time .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the single currency will unite to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be holding onto the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of shattering itself with the united states .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain , alone , is in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying that berlin and brussels should say what they can get to where .
i suspect that scotland could be in a looser european union , provided we have our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is essential in a non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider the same thing as norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against the austerity policies in europe , and has a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now only to be able to make a austerity policy imposed by berlin and brussels .
early puberty : grow up faster
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly imply puberty .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in young people and is more pronounced in young people .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who focuses on child health and family issues .
if a mother is worried when her daughter is breast and shameless at the age of seven or eight ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pediatricians association , this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrine doctor explained dr. paul kapaul kaplologist .
“ i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not a sign that the puberty is now fast , ” explains caplowitz .
obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shampoo and armpit hairs , and body odor , are found in girls earlier .
however , there was only one slight shift in the age of menarche ( first rule bleeding ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; when the breast is developing , it takes at least two to three years to get to the menark , &quot; said kaplowitz , also author of the book “ early puberty in girls : the essential guide to treating girls .
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
it is controversial what actually marked the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early in the morning ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight .
in most cases , the process is slowing or stagnating – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .
if progress is faster , tests could be performed by an endicronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts .
there are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and resisting another consequence : premature aging of the bones , ultimative treatment of growth barriers .
the recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
caplowitz is reticent about drugs , but he admits : “ suppressing puberty can solve behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age genome .
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about pregnancy risk or how to improve hygiene .
“ it was a shock , ” a woman who had a daughter with ten days had remembered .
although there were initial signs and we talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she came frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are found in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messaging in the media .
boys , like girls , come to puberty in the past .
kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which showed a link between body fat and adolescent puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .
in this country , afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , early puberty seems to have been influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .
another puzzle : although boys have had the facial and shamboyant hair growing earlier , the trend towards a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as pronounced as girls .
other doctors at the aap conference underlined the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of acne and shamhair is even common in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we can identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children .
parents should not hesitate to contact their pediatrician to discuss how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you need to talk earlier than expected , ” says kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .
jumbo manufacturers are arguing in favour of large orders over seat width and time limits in the face of large orders .
there has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats in long-range flights .
the dispute is about the seat width , passengers on long flights in the tourist class are offered , not always those who are not interested in the airlines most .
airbus has been calling for industry standards this week , with a minimum seat width of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us ore bull is still in the news .
the dispute comes at a time when the plane-builders are competing to buy even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft , and the us is taking part in the event from november 17th to 21st .
how the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it is rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results indicated , which will make the new “ mini jumbo ” design .
boeing claims that its modernised “ 77x ” fasse has 406 people with seats in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row .
airbus declares that it will be possible to carry 350 passengers in 18 inch wide seats in the touristic class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often share technical details through advertising in the specialized press .
now , before the dubai airshow , where the 777x with more than 100 orders is expected to take the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an advertisement that marks the beginning of a new advertising war and that showed donors an image of three people squeezing together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would you accept that ? ”
&quot; boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props , &quot; said airbus sales director john leahy .
given changing dietary habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when boeing 747 defined the modern long distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has increased from 40 to 49 years by ten percent .
the waist range of the average male in the 21st century is about 100.8 cm , according to us health statistics .
airbus says its rival is in line with a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was narrower .
it has carried out studies , airbus has said , to show that an additional customs duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat would increase sleep quality by 53 % .
boeing denies airbus ’ figures for the seat , saying that it is not at the manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines should strike the balance between fares and equipment .
the company also explains , according to studies , that the experience on the plane is more than the width of the seat .
“ it really amounts to giving airlines flexibility to do so , as they see fit .
you do not want us to dictate to you what makes you profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned about more freedom from elbows , but manufacturers are increasingly facing a subject that has an impact on sales .
behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades , which has a lasting impact on the us or europe ’ s export record .
as reuters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .
both airbus and boeing claim that 20 % more efficiency per seat is achieved with their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , which has 365 seats boeing 77-300er .
boeing ’ s statements on the results are partly dependent on the 777x , with its ten seats per row , being designed with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than that currently used on ten seats per row .
&quot; boeing therefore quits more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , &quot; says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at 777s indicate that many passengers were in favour of the tighter arrangement , which would be accompanied by cheaper fares .
&quot; eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is excluded from the 777 threat .
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world &apos;s traveler jet sellers even carry bandwidth to help the equipment in competition .
even if you promote comfort , all manufacturers offer high speed , high density jets .
airbus offers an a350 with ten seat rows , but it has not sold it .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of greater flexibility in cabins and of having wide seats on the corridors for some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to crumble , but will be discouraged from the 777x sales wave .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could give the pleasure of smoking a kick start .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that reduces the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life .
before human testing , further tests are needed , which may take some years , but professor ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop smoking , using all the methods available on the market to try , but have had to experience that their nippies are stronger than they .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to disclose genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produces a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before they can dispose of the brain , causing a smoker to not smoke a high nicotine .
in experiments held vaccinated mice that nicotine was administered , their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said , a sign that nicotine has reached its brain .
the experiments are published in the fachblatt science translational medicine .
earlier vaccines against tobacco failed because they were anti-bodies .
vaccination had to be used to maintain the antibody level so often that it would be expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , a future vaccine for people who have no doubt about the safety of children could be used before they are tempted to have a cigarette .
more likely , though , smokers would use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : when you start smoking again , you feel a little more uncomfortable because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps you to get rid of habit , &quot; he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .
tripodi denies , to have been influenced by obeid to be influenced by .
against former minister joe tripodi of the labor-market party , an investigation by the government corruption commission is being launched .
the former nsw minister denies that the rules on maritime transport are being reviewed at the request of his political mentor , eddie obeid , who has hidden interests in three land areas on state-controlled land .
the independent commission against the us government has decided to introduce a new policy for the fight against corruption .
now , the accusation is being investigated that tripodi has been accused of obiden &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tripodi &apos;s former deputy chief of staff , lynne aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .
in years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had insisted on public tender for lease contracts .
the poets opposed this and also wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies were awarded to the circular quay , which earned the obedids $ 2.5 million annually , without public tender .
tripodi , the port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , initially spoke out in favour of public tenders .
but he refused to accept the changes at obeid ’ s request , which , as tripodi confirmed , was aimed at a redesign of the government ’ s lease arrangements .
one of the icac ’ s written records showed talks between obeid , tripodi , and steve dunn , a senior official who went to the port ministry .
“ was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements ? ” the deputy commissioner , anthony whealy , asked tripodi .
“ no , ” tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes attack targets in syria , according to official sources .
israeli fighter planes would have a destination on thursday night in latakia syrian port , confirmed a senior government official to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the goal was russian sa-125 missiles .
israel has already , this year at least twice , carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ real test ”
the government is thinking about a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 457-visa requirements as part of extended measures .
if the test is introduced , it would be used beyond a criterion that would prevent the 457 being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the family and friends to australia .
a proposal for a government discussion was published today , after the former labour party mps , maxine mckew , had taken note of the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers , because they were not considered by australia &apos;s neighbors .
“ loud statements such as foreigners should take place behind themselves , ” and , if australians are to be first prepared , a very unpleasant backlash in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told australia .
historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echo the echo of this historic artifact , they would not be able to surprise me .
the proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were formerly adopted by the former immigration minister chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who spoke yesterday about trafficking in human beings in sri lanka , has identified five of the recommended changes that other countries will make , and the others will be considered .
if the ‘ authenticity criterion ’ is adopted , then someone who applied for a visa could be reviewed to see whether ‘ the application is valid in the cases where it is not accepted ’ .
companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after the 457 companies that had initially only a small number of workers were willing to support , after all , hundreds have been hired .
meanwhile , a 35 year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after being killed this week with a refugee boat on the christmas island .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to australia has been killed since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult cousin who is also on the boat .
the australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study that will examine the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 high-speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project “ will bring britain closer ” .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 has been completed , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between london and northern england from eur 32.7 billion to gbp 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has entrusted hs2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less by glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national route network that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are going ahead with hs2 because it brings enormous advantages .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about connecting 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which is improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state alistair carmichael commented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for the scottish constitution to be ‘ unequivocal ’ .
brown said , “ the high-speed rail link has the potential to bring enormous economic benefits to scotland , but at the same time scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the glasgow-edinburgh government more efficient .
i look forward to discussing the report of the inquiry with the british ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian air passengers must continue to use tablets and smartphones at the start and landing , despite efforts in the us to improve the regulation of such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can fly on their equipment during critical flight phases .
during most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not able to use their e-books when starting and landing .
australian companies are watching the decision that the us airlines have to do a lot of work to implement , but they are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their rules .
the casa air traffic control authority also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment were not fully met in critical flight phases in australia .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on aircraft at the moment ” , has been announced .
the subject is subject to provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at all times and to allow passengers to exercise the safety instructions given by cabin crew .
virgin has already started talks with casa about extending the use of its wi-fi entertainment system to flights and explains how you are open to change , that you need to be initiated by the legislator .
“ we would like to see the casa approval review , because we are convinced that this is the way to improve customer experience , now that we have ( wireless entertainment ) used the system during the flight ” , said one speaker .
qantas explained that they will remain in the current rules for the time being .
“ our current directives provide that electronic equipment is not used at start and landing , and we do not have any plans to change it at the moment , ” the company explained .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will be very concerned about the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision affects us companies differently depending on the age of the fleet .
you must prove that your aircraft tolerates the interference from mobile devices , and that manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instruction change .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels ” , announced the airline ’ s .
in rare cases , the crew will attack passengers who are not able to control the equipment during the landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be safely installed under the seat or in the compartments over the seats when they are landed or when they are in the landing area .
before the schalke revierderby , a group of traveled bvb supporters had equipped luminous missiles for ugly scenes in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund announced hard consequences .
before the friday match of the bundesliga football league against the vfb stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost already ghostly acoustics that was shown to the viewer until just before the start of the bundesliga game between german vice champion borussia dortmund and the vvvvvvvfd .
the guest fans were mostly listening to their songs .
the southern grandstand , on the other hand , is where the faithful - and loudest - fans of bvb were initially extremely quiet : no singing , no battle calls .
the podium of capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint moisture , remained unoccupied .
and right in the front of the grandstand , lonely waved a big flag with the title &apos; section banning stadium &apos; .
only as a goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always the first bvb player entered the square , burned temporary cheer .
when his team colleagues followed , there was a loud voice and wearing scarves - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand , nothing was bothered .
the stadium spokesman norbert dickel also has to revisit the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract renewal by trainer jürgen klopp - did not make for the event .
only five minutes before the attack , the capo will get its podium - and the two players will be able to cope with the real tension .
finally , as always , it was the turn of the southern grandstand - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again as usual .
and at the latest as with whistle from the south grandstand the loudly call &quot; derbysieger stands on &quot; came , again , was everything as usual .
the silence that preceded it was probably a response to what has happened over the past few days .
just before the invaders at fc schalke 04 , some of the coach fans had a luminous missile in the ranks and in the square - and they had almost torn down .
the game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the top of the dortmund ultras then received in his office - and believe watzke &apos;s words , this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives .
&quot; it is used for the entire ultra movement to make massive cuts , &quot; the bvb boss announced on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , watzke prohibited the ultras from performing a choreography for home matches against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden that , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ultras have been given various opportunities for punishment - until tuesday they now have time to choose one .
otherwise , according to watzke , the bvb will have to impose a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be a big change &quot; , assured watzke .
we can look forward to seeing the reactions in the southern gallery .
pfandhaus are booming in singapore , as the middle-class crisis has arrived .
in a pfandhaus in the bendermeer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga exudes a golden armreif , a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , my money is in it , ” amirthalinga says .
although she is usd 3,000 per month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative employee and her husband also work , the monthly salary of the family is not sufficient , she explains .
indeed , in parts of south-east asia – where household debt is rising – demand is so large that valuemax , where it can be exchanged , will be the third deposit this week .
the pledging of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the janani amirthalinga case – but also almost as cheap as a cheap bank .
typically , pfandhouses in singapore require an effective 17 % annual rate , which is just above 15.4 % , which the united overseas bank requires , to be a local lender with a local loan of one .
however , pfandhäuser offers the advantage that no credit rating or income verification is required , which means that loans are faster than banks can .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to pfandhaus , as families are put under increased living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income seek pfandhaus homes to help the country ’ s stottern economy .
this week , the credit rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , a risk factor for creditworthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore have , according to the agency ’ s assessment , the highest budget debt in asia relative to gdp .
malaysia is the top country in the world , accounting for 80 % of gdp , and a 60 % increase in 2008 .
economists are also worried about thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which comes just out of a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continued export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to bottom segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible . ”
historic gold price peaks over the past two years have fueled the trend of pledging personal objects , as people take the opportunity to discover family jewellery in cash .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the city ’ s 200 pfandhouses of gold .
people say to themselves , “ the price of gold looks good , let us pledge the gold chain to grandmother and get it back next month . ”
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has a 20 % customer loyalty increase in its branches in recent months .
growth in the pfandbrief business is so strong that valuemax , the owner of the branch in bendermeer and 15 other in singapore , not only wants to expand into neighbouring malaysia – where the company .
the company finances this at 60 % of the 66 million singapore dollars it has received this week with the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders are on the brink of a crushing fire for high interest rates , yeah declares that pfandhouses are not only cheaper than other lenders , but also did not raise the debt directly .
“ customers borrow items that they already own , and the liquid personal valuables do not increase household indebtedness , ” she explains .
the lending business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secure financing for society .
nor are all people using pfandery in financial difficulty .
rich people from singapore also come to the stores of valuemax to remove gold bars and rolex watches , which are the best way to buy up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
we have clients from all social backgrounds .
“ these include wealthy people who , in the short term , lend something to a business or investment , or small businesses that are bridging cash-flow bottlenecks , ” yeah says .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .

rescue package of over 325 million australian dollars for tasmanic health care
the australian government insists on the tough conditions that the rescue package has created over 325 million australian dollars for the tasmanian health care to ensure that the country ’ s government is doing the job .
federal minister of health , tanya plibersek , has announced that the commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases .
funding for a period of four years has been resumed after government consultations with the independent tasmanian member andrew wilkie .
“ the government has failed to produce an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges that the federal state faces . ”
the $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral performance .
further 2600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatment for gray star , are intended to eliminate residues .
there is also money for day-clinics in hobart and launceston , better post-operative care after stationary stays , specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic recording .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that patients have told me that they are the best way to get the tasmanian health system to improve , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the commonwealth , and be able to report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .
a three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie has explained today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that would undermine the public tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first offered to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of worries , ” wilkie said .
according to the state government , these election results will largely compensate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s spokesman on health policy , peter dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ palliative . ”
“ we are in a position today because the lab government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to abc tv .
it is not acceptable for a state government to get almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the commonwealth to invest 300 million in it and then pretend that the good news is good news .
dutton asked plessek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , but is also a more severe diet than necessary .
the french action of the 1760 ’ s tells the graceful story of suzanne , a young nobleman who was brought to the monastery by her family .
when she rebelled , she was faced with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic master and became the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slides away into obstinacy or sensationalism – and therein lies its problem .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a tortuous blow for the public too .
syria has lost its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group , a surveillance group has suggested that the country should not be allowed to close its arms .
syria has established important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gitfgases , declared the global monitoring group on chemical weapons on thursday , while there are still serious conflicts in the north of the country near one of the world ’ s major sites .
on thursday , too , a syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have died from the civil war ’ s onset soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came a day before the date of the first meeting of the european parliament on 11 september .
1 november , which the hague based organisation damascus had set up to complete all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to “ operate inoperable ” , including all machinery for mixing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is , in fact , the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in syria by mid-2014 .
the destruction of facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , still has to start destroying the weapons and supplies that are available .
it is estimated that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when thursday fights in the city of safira were taking place , from which experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the uk based company , was doing .
the group of activists who have a network of activists in syria persecuted the number of dead declared on thursday , 120,296 people died .
61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children , are among these .
on the government side , 29,954 of them were under the army of president bashar assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
the dead also had 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of whom were foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to the disappearance of some two million people .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in safira for weeks , many of whom have links with al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that there was losses on both sides on thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting underscores the danger that chemical weapons inspectors face , because their mission to liberate syria from its toxic arsenal of arms is a race against time in the midst of a deadly civil war .
according to opcw , which works closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it can support all of the major production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and witness their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checks and that 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by damascus had visited .
due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc stated that the two sites had been “ abandoned , ” according to syrian statement , and the existing objects of the chemistry weapons programme had been transferred to other institutions that were inspected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two facilities that the opcw inspectors could not visit .
syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , to be approved by the opwc executive committee next month .
“ i prefer to take the hat off the bravery and courage that you all have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation . ”
for three years now , the mainly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting assad ’ s government and security forces , which have killed many members of the alawites , in this civil war , of secession .
in view of further developments , the head of the observatory , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .
anger at the judgment of bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in bali in 2002 in the bomb attack responded with anger at the ruling for the last of the instigators who were brought to justice .
patek , who was considered one of the most sought after people in south-east asia for nearly ten years , was yesterday awarded the title of president for his role in building explosive tanks for the bombing .
with a suspension , he could be released after 15 years .
the 45 year old was convicted of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where the 202 people died .
a guilty verdict was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives on churches in indonesia .
the public prosecutor had demanded a life sentence , even though it was a punishment for the man who was accused of being a master bomb builder because of his reputation as a “ demolition man ” .
the decision has painful memories of june corteen , a mother from perth who had spent her 39-year-old twin towers jane and jenny in the patek and his fellow conspirators .
she said , fighting with tears , that patek should have been sentenced to death .
i really think that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; one should take him to a shooting command , &quot; said corteen to aap .
i have to live every day with the fact that i will not get any more grandchildren and i will never see my daughters .
the sari club was made equal to the ground when , on 12 october 2002 , a huge bomb was exploded in a small truck just after 23 : 00 , which had been parked in front of the night club .
peter hughes was at paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber killed a bomb .
he fell into coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he was working on a life support system .
hughes said that patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell yemah islamiah – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra – who were responsible for the bloodshed .
really , this type should be given the death penalty before anyone else .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to let him live .
20 years after killing 202 people and having injured many hundreds , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers who stood trial .
he escaped arrest for almost a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces killed the former al-qaeda leader , otah , less than four months later .
during the negotiation , a fbi agent said that intelligence reports provided the indication that the patek had been in pakistan , in order to visit bin laden , with the aim of strengthening the link between south-east asian groups .
&quot; he did not stand , &quot; said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no remorse for the suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , which was celebrated with commemorations in bali and australia .
“ there will be many tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek may still appeal against his verdict .
faa : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now travel from the departure to the landing to read , work , play , listen to music and use the image of films , but not with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , faa staff member michael huerta stated at a press conference .
airlines must prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations governing the stowing of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the faa stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to allow the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the plan ’ s condition , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the faa in a statement .
currently , passengers must have smartphones , tablets and other devices switched off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .
when entering the country , passengers must turn it off again and not restart it before the aircraft has landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are insured against electronic disruption could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at start , landing and on the roller field , the faa declared .
most new aircraft and other aircraft used for the use of wi-fi in larger heights are now available .
laura glading , president of the professional cabin crew association , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regime is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” commented glading .
we are , frankly , tired of having to feel like a watchdog on this issue .
however , internet connections remained unavailable for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres , explained the authority .
passengers are invited to use smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so there is still no word with friends , the scrabble online game that is the most popular one , the actor alec baldwin 2011 .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited .
the regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not with the faa .
faa may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at start and landing on the basis of the launch and landing of electronic equipment at the start and landing of the vehicle at the airport .
last month , mark rosenker said of the road safety board , safety expert , safety adviser for national transport issues on cbs news , mobile phones are still considered a risk .
“ mobile phones are a real problem , not only because they potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices , but because we know from the fcc that the transfer from the air also interfere with transmitter masts ” , says .
a advisory committee of the industry , which has been invited by the faa to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government should take a wider approach to personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure on the faa has increased to loosen restrictions on use .
critics like the democratic senator claire mccaskill from missouri argue that there is no valid security reason for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies have suggested that up to a third of passengers are prevented from switching off the equipment or from doing so .
the faa began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances to navigation and communication equipment were reported by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed in this way and approved by the faa , so that electronic interference does not make them any .
airlines have been offering wi-fi , if the airline is up to the flight level for several years .
the customized flyers adapted to wi-fi systems are also more insensitive to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used more effectively in accordance with the new directives , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you scroll around .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
among those who support easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is amazon.com.
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find them .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using the equipment .
douglas kidd of the national association of airline passengers said he was the head of the disorder caused by the appliances , even though the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who were in charge of disturbing aircraft systems by the aircraft .
the committee recommended that the faa should allow pilots to use the instrument landing under poor conditions of vision .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who are now heavily equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea drilling island saved bird .
a ventilation service flown to the coast , the exhausted on a north sea boat .
last month , the water purse was flown to aberdeen by a helicopter , where it was spca in its rettendcenter in the allowance center .
colin seddon , head of the centre , said : “ this water ral was probably a winter draught bird from northern europe , which was buried by the strong winds over the north sea . ”
apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .
he added : “ he could no longer fly , so we would be contacted with the request for help . ”
when they were released , the water ral was back in shape and healthy .
is europe &apos;s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who want to do in britain for prosperity and jobs can do in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders , asking them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
yougov questioned more than 1,000 business leaders who had roughly the size of the uk , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside europe and are focused on countries that need to modernise and grow , while eu states are stagnating .
they want the government to establish new trade links with countries like china , india and brazil , rather than to engage in the long and demanding process .
asked about your view on certain legal issues – from antitrust legislation to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be controlled by westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , as companies have said that the cost of brussels legislation now outweighs the benefits of being part of europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to the same .
finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority had been moving from britain to change the agreement and that a relationship with the eu based on trade was not based on politics .
this realization , which has been shared by companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaningful change ” that will reopen the issue of action to britain .
there is a lot at stake – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would result in 16 % change in opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for renegotiating the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are moving from renegotiation to a significant shift in the balance of power back to the uk .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward closer integration of the economy and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , what makes business more concerned about trade and about fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation .
alexei miller of gazprom calls the pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era
the construction of the south stream pipeline in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , declared the gazprom board .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said gazprom ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used for greater diversity in russia ’ s export routes through europe .
a dispute over the treaty between gazprom and its counterparts in ukraine , where the majority of russian gas is stored for europe , is a cause for increased risk in conventional routes , such as those of official operators .
miller said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries &apos; geopolitical risks will be “ disconnected forever . ”
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream at reduced rates if the entire project is to be launched in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction works in other secondary countries are to be completed on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is estimated to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff members are protected from accusations against jonathan lord for sexual offences .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are accused of sexual offences in connection with children before they are accused of being on the child care provider jonathan lord in 2011 .
but the opening declaration before the commission had stated that the ymca had never been associated with an incident of sexual violence in the organisation .
phillip hare was consulted on a case in which a ymca employee was accused of child pornography offences .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assisting lawyer , that he knew of the first case , but the second one did not know .
he admitted that the ymca &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming that ‘ there have been external checks by the ymca to make the ymca a member of the front line .
evidence to the commission shows , rather , that the ymca was informed that it had the second-lowest assessment of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of education and communities ( education ministry ) .
hare , who started with 21 at the ymca , admitted that the management had “ gone downwards from me ” in the recruitment of lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two years of activity for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare , however , refused to allow the ymca to be a cultural problem that prevented staff from prosecuting lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .
the staff said that they had observed violations , including that lord had been alone with children , that they had been privately treated as babysitters , that they had to sit on his lap , to one that he liked it .
danielle ockwell , whose chief lord was and who was asked to give a child protection training because she was not allowed to be involved , said that he was not allowed to be a child care officer , jacqui bari .
the managing director declared that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to reimburse their superiors .
instead , he said , they have instead expressed their friendship with lord &apos;s judgement , which is why they did not report him .
hare explained that he has sent a letter to the board of the ymca nsw that the lesson that the organization learned from the jonathan lord incident was too great .
hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations were made was taken by the managing director of the children &apos;s services of ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but it should be ‘ over-zealous ’ and poorly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , no organization safe for children , professor stephen smallbone of the griffith university declared .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in the recruitment , verification , processing , training and supervision of employees .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair said he would miss the chance to return as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade of state leadership , blair has largely avoided expressing an opinion on british politics , and his comments mostly relate to foreign policy and its role as envoy of the quartet peace mission .
when asked whether he would like to return to the prime minister ’ s post , blair was removed from london by the london evening standard saying , “ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that it will happen ... ”
when horse-drawn experts in droves found themselves in cardiff to pounce the year , they knew that a harsh competition was taking place .
but no one was born on the three years old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago made his first steps , and his shetland pony toffee drifted through the three rounds and got the first round .
the inseparable pair , both equal , were displaced because of their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition , which was held by sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry .
in his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had his helmet in a cheeky corner and led the two years old toffee through the ring .
fenton was chosen by the jurors for his natural skills in handling the pony , which lay well above his age .
and toffee received top marks for his performance and personality .
fenton had toffee last march as a gift to his third birthday and since then every day with the shetland pony practiced .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great span . ”
they had to compete against the entire field of participants and are filled with gold cup and rosette .
it was only the second time that he was participating in a competition with toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .

howell ’ s story was : “ the entire audience was like electricised , and everyone fired and clapped him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he has done fantastic work .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to make him look after .
as it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure that it will do well .
a spokesman for the annual horse-show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to handle his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evaluated fenton and toffee for how well they beaten and presented in the demonstration ring .
they are looking for good cooperation between pony and leader – and fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .

chinese newspaper is said to be “ reformed ” after appeal
a chinese newspaper that has called for the release of a reporter on the front page , accused of defamation , should be reformed .
the guangzhou based new express had a rare public call to release the former journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to write reports about a sub-state company .
now the new express will be subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulator explained .
the “ rectification order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in guangdong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new express , which is part of the yangcheng evening news group , will be available between september 2012 and august 2013 , several inaccurate reports on the listed company .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that they decided to impose “ administrative punishment on chen yongzhou and to give him his reporter ’ s license . ”
in addition , the yangcheng evening news group has been instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the new express and has recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the new express be identified and immediately appoint the new express executive team .
chen had written several articles for the new express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release at the front page and turned behind his journalist &apos;s work .
but chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports on pay .
“ in this case , i have damaged zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s trust , ” he explained to the state news channel cctv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and glory .
i have realised that i have acted incorrectly .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express released an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several known suspects have recently been on television making concessions .
experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing anyone to accuse themselves .
the drug tunnel , which has its own railway system , is being discovered between the usa and mexico , is being explored by the us and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found .
the tunnel , which is a zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects storage halls near tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unseen warehouses in the area , making it easier to use drug-loaded trucks .
the tunnel was closed before drugs were undetected in it , the authorities declared .
the tunnel was discovered by means of eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine , as the court &apos;s records indicate .
three men , according to the authorities , who worked as drivers were arrested for possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with prison sentences of between ten years and a lifetime if they are guilty of guilt .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in san diego .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which poses the challenge of the drug cartels to quickly bring their product to the consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a passage of almost 640 metres long with rails , which were taken from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two warehouses in san diego .

in an interview with us journalist katie couric , who was on friday ( local time ) , the german press said that bloom , &quot; life sometimes does not go exactly as we would like it to be or planned .
kerr and he himself still loved , emphasized the 36-year-old .

veganism is , according to lexika , subordinated to vegetarianism , but is very different from this one .
because while vegetarians are interested in eating cream cakes , ice cream or a powerful edam , these feederies are not on the menu of a vegan .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the waiver of meat and fish , the vegans will not let any animal products - even honey will be denied .
what remains , you may ask yourself , but the vegan diet is characterised by a considerable amount of imagination .
&quot; bread spreads are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visits the shop at domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealand vegan has lived , and in lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . &quot; in 1997 i completed my diet and became a vegetarian .
the turn of the century was followed by the next step and i became vegans .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the shoe selection &quot; , says proctor , the artificial leather prefers normal leather .
he realized that it is possible to do it without animal products in other everyday concerns .
vegan is primarily an ethics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans who have to cover the whole consumption behaviour .
instead of burgers , rigs or rubber bears , i have decided to use the vegan to quickly discover new products that have increased enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; in fact , vegan does not represent a renunciation , not an ascetic , but an enrichment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that led to the failure of some , even so well-intentioned , attempts .
&quot; the addiction factor is a decisive factor that quickly gives up many , similar to smoking , &quot; proctor represents a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain flavours are not to be found on the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .
&quot; however , you can also produce the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the vegans .
for example , proctor brings aubergines , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages to the barbecue festival .
he is concerned about balanced , varied diet , which is also a very good choice for a while .
of course , you want to have something between your teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only to reduce to animal food , &quot; proctor said .
health damage , food disorders , another common assumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the changeover has had a positive aspect .
i do not take a foreign cholesterol and i have an increased vitamin content .
there are high-performance hall dedicated exclusively to vegan nutrition .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check myself , &quot; tells proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegansics .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , rather than grazing in pastures , it is questionable whether there is a lack of food in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator .
vegans also have the option of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proctor should not go in the direction of food procurement .
after all , basic foodstuffs are everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
all i need is on the spot .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is the case with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products .
anyway , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally assumed .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small snacks you can achieve good , if not better results in part , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , proctor could also astonish his brother-in-law .
family celebrations give vegans a new spice .
this is dynamic when you cook together , and it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he was also sceptical .
do you not taste my meal any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - at such a question you should ask as a vegan with fingertips .
&quot; i do not reject the people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to be a concession .
and , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as unfamiliar as it might be - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually do .
fast food is also allowed .
pommes is everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel or a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria he deviates from pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .
the restaurants are slowly getting into this .
&quot; when i started to teach vegan to feed myself 13 years ago , it was all much harder , &quot; the new zealand can identify a development : &quot; you have to talk to people to make them aware of it .
&quot; when there are enough questions , they may be inclined to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants develop , such as the combüse in mannheim or the café vogelfrei .
proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are available for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor says .
&apos;if we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way of getting the vast majority of it out of the question , &apos; says proctor .
but buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .
especially if you learn to understand that animal additives are also used in peanuts as colouring agents , you seem to be in a position to be satisfied with the ethics of so many hurdles and quickly fall out of courage .
not only because of this , reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that are not only nutritional but also nutritional .
&quot; gradually , you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or stumble , &quot; says proctor .
veganism , it is an important moral finger , which strikes at consciousness .
perhaps he does not manage to abandon his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to take a critical look at his habits .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s bubble
the treasury has provisionally calculated the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of treasury chancellor george osborne , who has been included in the 2012 budget a stamp tax of $ 1.25 .
already , revenue from stamp taxes on residential property in the westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea districts is exceeding the tax rate of $ 27.8 million in 2012 / 13 .
cook said : “ after the increases in stamp taxes on high-priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against one , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed , regardless of the impact of the alert .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in london , or prevent owners from selling , ” he added .
first-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in london ’ s wealthy southwest belt , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon , has been around the record .
central london prices were growing at a level of 5.6 % annually , but were accompanied by an emerging “ domestic market . ”
scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s pregnancy is related to its mood .
past research has shown that happy dogs are more like the tail to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while there are horny dogs with left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and can respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist from the university of trento , said : “ people know well that the left and right half of the brain respond differently to stimuli , which have positive or negative effects .
here we tried to look at this with other species .
he also noticed that dogs , like humans , have the right half of the brain for movement on the left and vice versa , and that the two hemisphere have different roles in emotions .
to learn more about how dogs are applied to the lateral pregnancy of their brethren , the researchers supervised the animals while they were watching other dogs .
they measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the cock is getting into one direction , sometimes in the other direction .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have shown dogs movies – either a natural fidelity or a silhouette to make distracting other aspects .
if the animals saw how an otherwise unprintable dog could move the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the weaving dog ) , they stayed completely relaxed .
but was the tail tendency mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the wedelt ) , so their heart rate increased and they saw uneasy .
professor vallortigara believes that dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they are worried about and when not .
he said , “ if you have different encounters with other dogs and you want to use weaving with your tail in one direction more with friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of that . ”
researchers say that the findings dog owners , veterinarians and trainers can help to better understand the emotions of their animals .
john bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the faculty of animal health at the university of bristol stated that this is not the first study to be examined whether links were being left or wrong .
last year , a team from the university of lincoln found that dogs turned their head to the left when they watch an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada , the following was : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when his tail is weaved on the left and not right , rather than being uneasy .
according to his statement , the differences could arise because the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs are not interpreted as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception to this , ” braidsw said .
but since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes turns into one , sometimes into the other .

pope francis appoints cardinals in february , and the first cardinals in the city of florence will be appointed in february .
pope francis will be presenting new cardinals for the first time on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the most senior clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope , so that francis becomes the first group of men to appoint .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”
in a statement in which the message was announced , father federico lombardi , a speaker of the vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held .
“ pope francis has decided to reconsider his decision to convene the consistorie in february in advance , so that others can meet to celebrate cardinal participation from around the world .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of eligible cardinals will probably be reduced by february .
he said that a pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary to reduce the number of eligible cardinals to 120 , and so many cardinals were killed over 80 , as he would like .
the consistency story next year is important because it is the first since the election of francis in march this year , so valero says .
there is currently a certain overhang on the part of europe , and italy in particular .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope cardinals are to be appointed from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be involved since the formation of the council of cardinals founded by francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of carrying out reforms .
in the past , the pope decided everything on its own .
&quot; now francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that it is “ possible ” that francis would have to ask the cardinals for advice .
but , so far , we have not been in this position – all of this is new .
valero said that typically the bishops from large places were called cardinals , but steak francisco “ full of surprises – we know not to know who he was appointed . ”

some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for backpacking the front seat backrest .

the returned models were delivered between august 1 and september 10 .
the delivery of the gm trucks began in june and represents the most important model start of the leading us car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed vehicle owners in the first half of october about the defect .
the nhtsa was unable to reach the nhtsa due to the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in october .

the cry for despair of an obama electorate
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made commendable efforts to break the deadlock of republicans .
blocking policy does not excuse the site problems of obamacare , the drone attacks , the blockade attacks , and the attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student at harvard medical school in the second year .
i am reading a terrible sad book at the moment .
it is a book i thought it would be a great help to me during the deceptive second year of my medical studies and to give me hope again .
it is called &quot; the audacity to win &quot; ( courage to win ) and describes the memoirs barack obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .
when i finish with my patients &apos; records in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave a speech breath .
the election was a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to underline the historic significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had an agreement value of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you were taken out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , something has actually changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act ( ccp ) to military take-off .
i agree that the party political blockade is too much in the way of overlapping our nation &apos;s efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for hospitals and the closing of public health insurance .
but , having repeatedly accused the obama administration of having been a member of colleagues and acquaintances , i have ended with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political despair .
republican blockade politics cannot explain why tapping foreign leaders is not allowed .
it cannot explain why the national security agency should collect data on the privacy of americans and why whistleblowers are punished , which is open to state misconduct .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and education policies had been exceeded during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which says that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the nixon government . ”
and , more recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know if that is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood at 18 that the work of government contradicts the political campaigns that preceded it .
it is clear that the members &apos; office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and incidental events such as the newtown massacre shape public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me the most .
i voted again in 2012 for obama , not because i was delighted with his candidacy .
mitt romney posed a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , he seemed to be unable to define his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfill the hope we have heard about for so long .
but , with the decline in the approval ratings for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become harder .
it is a reason for my longing for the many promises that have disappeared into thin air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama can avoid a severe loss against clinton in the pennsylvania pre-election .
in a meeting with the election agents following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to rediscover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , and i could not agree more with you .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has had a conflict of interests over parental leave .
the billionaire and mep clive palmer say that prime minister tony abbott would be in conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters would become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnat , which is engaged in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that when he asked questions from the table , whether he was in a conflict .
the palmer united party could win up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether to lower co2 and mining taxes or cut them .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of abbott would benefit personally from the laws .
&quot; he is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holiday , &quot; said palmer .
two months after the election , the palmer election commission declared palmer ahead with 53 votes after the recount officially the winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a review of the voting counting process to speed up .
tony abbott &apos;s daughter frances and bridget .
if these elections were to be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we can marry in , enter the data into a computer , immediately choose and then leave at 6.30 am ?
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
use them because you can then wipe out the results if you do not like them ?
tuning pencils today is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to its policy is an international airport for the sunshine coast and that it will be “ very serious ” to take its new office .
a public office is about public service .
“ we are not seeking any reward other than that of history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs is suspending two forex traders
the royal bank of scotland has two dealers from its forex department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the currency is being used worldwide .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , which daily generates 5.3 trillion dollars .
the two dealers would be the first rbs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that has been followed by the libor interbank scandal .
the bank , which has not commented on the suspension , confirmed this month that it will receive information requests from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are working fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that the rbs had not read the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to a previous dealer to the uk regulator , the financial conduct commission .
this dealer , richard usher , had left rbs 2010 and is now expected to depart from its current position as european head of forex spot trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was released this week and matt gardiner , formerly the leading currency trader at barclays and ubs , was appointed by charity .
none of these dealers has been accused of any misconduct .
the usher instant message group included bankers in barclays and citigroup , said the people close to the situation .
ubs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their staff after the swiss regulator finma had declared that they had committed alleged manipulation of the currency market in a number of swiss banks under investigation .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently dealing with allegations of a lack of transparency .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said familiar people about the situation .
banks are going through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has left traders in a commotion in an area that has become one of the most profitable in trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year is under pressure because of low volumes , which are so different .
some bankers have tried to play the affair down and said that it is almost impossible to ignore the extensive and highly liquid currency exchange market .
a leading trader noticed that despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms was not allowed to lead to banks ’ “ becoming a problem .
the news came out the same day , when credit suisse announced that she had sent a london exchange traded fund vendor this week .
the bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter has been contained , ” credit suisse explained .
the fence on the bechtle plot paints the fence of the building on the plot .
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; schweizer wiese &quot; has created the fence on the bechtle plot at the spa promenade in bad herrenalb .
it also cleaned and widened the footpath , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , as the site is threatened with slipping .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had completed the decoration campaign with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the action of the bi was a transparent with the message &apos; we are for &apos; .
this disturbed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative little in their action .
her motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against building ruins &quot; .
it wanted to raise the risk of even bigger ruins on the swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day .
in conversation with many passers-by before the &quot; building site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the realisation of the city project will be a better thing for many , although not a few have the same questions about bi &apos;s dimension .
but they are beginning to resign , because the city is dragging on with these answers , they are said to be from the bi ’ s side .
as has been said , the public statements made by the mayor also have an impact .
may had said in the local council meeting that he had not thought it would be possible for the thermal baths to be closed if the population decided against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the swiss meadow .
some people seem to be quite frightened , others see them as &apos; crude attempts at blackmail &apos; on the part of the population , as stated in the press release of the bi .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .
rangnick schellen for schiris : mane no swallow king
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high form of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg is also , so disappointed was the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; demonstrated by the referees .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tendency for mane and alan to fall into the category of swallow kings , &quot; he took the two offensive wizards at a press conference in salzburg in schwalbenkings on thursday .
the most recent cause for rangnick ’ s criticism was yellow for mane at 3 : 0 vs. grödig last sunday , when the senegalese were accused of acting - which was not a bad thing .
&quot; a stark misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harkam described as &quot; completely overburdened &quot; .
harkam would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between salzburg-coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
he defended his german compatriot , saying : &quot; i would have behaved in the same way as roger schmidt in every single situation . &quot;
schmidt himself wants to be out of touch with his colleague after the scharmütter had been in contact with his husband .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was offended , &quot; emphasized the 46-year-old .
in view of the success of the event , rangnick agreed to a praise .
&quot; there are only two words for that , &quot; he said .
there is not much to be said .
the way the team plays is particularly impressive .
that is something that should continue .
change of the carpet during the winter transfer time will be very rare .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except a player asks for the wish that he or she will leave the club , &quot; rangnick made it clear .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the close to barack obama is a key health law .
by five votes to four , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act – it compels us citizens to reach a satisfactory level of health insurance by 2014 or to pay a penalty by 2014 .
the supreme judge john roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the judges scalia , thomas , alito , and kennedy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law and also expressed the view that the requirement for the health law that states should either accept or comply with the conditions for access to medicaid is sufficient .
the legal proceedings against the law were conducted by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was enforced by all leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger mitt romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .
norway : norwegian village is making itself felt with giant mirrors of light .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .
due to the low sunlight level , the vestfjord valley in rjukan sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors at 45 metres altitude , a century dream came true on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , mayor steinar bergsland shouted at the start ceremony in tv2 .
some of the inhabitants of the valley were able to sit on sunchairs , while others were using sunglasses for safety .
until now , sun-hungry people had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to steer the rays with mirrors into the valley .
but this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the council had finally obtained the 5 million kroner ( around eur 615 000 ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving viganella , the italian alpine village , a winter sunshine for several years .
post is hardly emptied on sundays
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red points for sunday sleeping are still on various letters .
a fdp request confirmed this .
on sundays and public holidays , only in front of the post office building in ernst-ludwig-strasse 36 and in jakob müller-strasse 1 in hüttenfeld .
whether in hofheim or rosengarten , empty also sunday , the answer to the fdp question will not be answered .
the fdp ’ s social and youth policy spokesman , fritz röhrenbeck , wants to make up for this .
sunday sleeping is an important postal service , especially at terminals .
&quot; this company is thin despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 radically and unreasonable &quot; .
thomas bittner , group and city committee chairman of the liberal group , supports his group colleagues : &apos; what annoys me is the fact that there are clameless empty hours here or that they have been deleted .
the post office is a long way from being close to the people .
&quot; at least the mailboxes in the neuchâtel and rosengarten districts must be emptied again on sundays , &quot; says bittner and röhrenbeck unisono .
the city of the city of the city , too , was ruled by the fact that , especially non-mobile citizens , a letterbox with sunday sleeping could also be reached on foot .
röhrenbeck in the municipal parliament asked if the city council plans to talk to the post about this .
mayor erich maier replied that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .
however , as he knows , there is also a sunday sleeping in hofheim .
your party has indeed voted in favour of privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; maier said .
frankfurt parking fees should increase significantly
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very friendly .
the city &apos;s magistrat is discussing a proposal for a traffic dezent stefan majer ( green ) this morning .
the parking fee is therefore to be increased by 50 % .
however , it is not the price that should be raised , but the time interval of parking clocks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
in december , the city council will have to decide on the next meeting of the municipal authorities .
the retail committee of the ihk frankfurt considers this &apos; not a good idea &apos; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly .
the german transport association believes that an increase after two decades &apos; &apos; is &quot; quite appropriate and actually long overdue &quot; .
public transport will also become more expensive .
freudenstadt : fast action is the host for the fast action !
the men i of the tsv freudenstadt had to be brought to the schiller school gym in reutlingen with a narrow cadre against the tg göningen by the swabian alb .
the elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team .
it soon became apparent that she , even for age reasons , was not entirely satisfied with the rapid actions of the city &apos;s enthusiasts .
with the hard and placed surcharges , the gowninger did not get very easy .
they repeatedly missed the opportunity offered by simon schenk and eduard schulz to clean up passports and attacks via the network and were not at the disposal of block defence .
two high first row wins clearly demonstrated the superiority of the city of freudenstadt in all matters .
in view of this crushing and determining performance , the third set was then made a little lax and sneezing at the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november the tv baiersbronn , who is able to win a clear victory in nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent on the field .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b-class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn was home to the second baiersbronn and freudenstadt teams .
they delivered a highly competitive two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused errors and punctuation , especially in ball picking ; even on passports , precision was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes prevented it from overcoming .
in this high-performance , very balanced encounter , the tv-team of marcus blasutto consistently voted for the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
day of care at the small english-hut .
the fifth day of care in the aftermath of the natura 2000 project &quot; oberhotzenwald &quot; was attended by a group of committed participants at the small english-speaking hut in ibach .
the report is based on the suggestions from the public that the view into the valley should be cut off from this day in the area of the hut , said mayor helmut kaiser .
many hikers , kaiser said , described this area as the glamour of the gorge platform where the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for facilitating the connection between man and nature .
it gives every citizen the opportunity to accentuate in nature itself .
at the same time , the tourist aspect can also be taken into account in ecological terms .
friederike tribukait , the department of nature conservation of the presidency of the federal republic of friederike tribukait explained this ecological aspect following the welcome given by tilman bollacher , who had taken over the patronage of good .
the tourist destination of the wide-ranging view is , according to tribukait , the goal of keeping the old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types , which has grown up to a certain extent .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass buffs , can no longer overcome barriers in the form of forest land .
they need these free links to conservation .
tribukait said that she did not want to miss this opportunity to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .
this planning includes not only seamless integration of the current measure .
a biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised unesco world heritage list and thus to ensure a continuous addition to the world heritage list of the world heritage sites .
after these different versions , the head of the territory of christoph wehle and life project manager cornelia bischoff shared the helpers in groups .
the larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forestry truck may be available .
a group of helpers should be concerned about the release of wax bushes and about the maintenance of a dry stone bar .
the aim was to have a clear view at the viewpoint .
löffingen : head still the only candidate for the post of president .

google , samsung , huawei for nortel patents sued for nortel patents
the group that has thousands of previous nortel patents tightened an avalanche of complaints about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers on thursday , including google , the company that was involved in insolvency auction .
rockstar , the consortium that has awarded nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , has been claiming samsung electronics co ltd. , htc corp , huawei , and four other companies .
rockstar is owned by apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .
patents concern technology , which includes search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , such as the complaint that this is at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
samsung ’ s representatives , huawei , htc and rockstar were not immediately accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc are producing mobile phones that are threatened with use of google &apos;s android operating system , which is in sharp competition with apple and microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 , google issued an initial bid of $ 900 million for nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .
after the nortel patents of rockstar were outbid , google motorola acquired mobility for 12.5 billion dollars , a business that was also used in part by motorolas library to patent .
“ although google failed to address the issue of patents in the auction , it has not yet won the patents , and is continuing to do so , ” says the lawyer .
rockstar claims a high loss from google , because it claims google &apos;s patent infringement is deliberate , so the accusation .
egypt sworn the first freely elected president
mohammed morsi is leaving the oath , but his triumph day should not be the end of egypt ’ s political disputes .
the islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thereby sworn the successor of husni mubarak , who spent 16 months earlier .
with his inauguration in the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 ribbons dressed in black robes of the court , which is located at the nile and has followed an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said morsi at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy , and stability , ” said 60-year-old morsi , an engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood , a us engineer .
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when morsi was attacked shortly after 11 o &apos;clock in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to applaud the new president , and , unlike the presidential prunk , the mubarak era , traffic was only halted for a short time , so that the car could be stopped .
as an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been a success since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for the islamists , but also for all .
“ egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue suit with red tie .
morsi later went to cairo university , where he was supposed to make his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem , which he listened to in his position of lord .
the military leader of the field marshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest auditorium of the university , with speakers from “ the army and the people are one hand ” .
the bastion secular education , built in 1908 , was a university of cairo that developed in the 1970 ’ s into a stronghold of islamic student groups .
morsi put a symbolic oath on tahir square on friday , the birthplace of the uprising that took place last year at the end of mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he vowed power .
but , with the official oath being laid before the court , and not before parliament as usual , it bows to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger disco offers two great evenings .
the new season in the falkenberger disco &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .
today &apos;s friday evening is called &quot; pump this party &quot; , tomorrow saturday evening we will be having a 10-25 party .
hot beats and cool sounds are naturally played by the organizers on both days .
workers crashed from ladder : heavy injury
when replacing a defective outer felt , a 51-year-old worker crashed on thursday in eggelsberg from a ladder and seriously injured .
the man from lamprechtshausen wanted to have a broken heating sensation on the outside facade of a guesthouse .
when he came to the roof trunk , the path slipped and the man fell on the concrete floor .
he suffered severe injuries and was killed with the rescue helicopter &quot; christophorus 6 &quot; in the state hospital salzburg .
rapes in south africa : two life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the offender has twice been sentenced to life on friday .
the station sabc reported this .
the victim later died from the consequences of severe injuries .
johannes kana was already guilty at the beginning of the week of crime .
the act had caused horror nationwide .
the 21-year-old anene booysen had been in bredasdorp near cape town in february in an industrial area .
the doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in vain .
the young people &apos;s sight was so horrific that the carers and sisters needed psychological support .
kana had admitted during the trial that he was in a bar on the night of the night with booyses .
he also conceded to have beaten and raped them , but he denied to pay for the death of the girl .
the police initially started with several offenders , but made two suspects redundant because the evidence against them was not enough .
the public prosecutor also stressed during the process that she was convinced that kana was alone at the time of the attack .
rape is already a common occurrence in south africa : around 64 000 advertisements are made every year for sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but with 82 million people , it has a significantly higher population than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa do not , however , appreciate the dark figure in the event of sexual violence at 10 to 25 times .

they thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in australia and the uk .
the travel company now assumes adjusted pre-tax annual profit from between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are met , this will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .
as graham turner announced , flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit in the first six months and made a strong start in the second half of the year , particularly in australia and the uk ’ s private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track to record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earnings recipients .
in australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , creating a slightly weaker market for business trips .
it was equally good for the flight centre leisure business in the uk , while business customers spend less here too .
the us business recovered from the seasonal weaker first six months , so that a profit of € 1.7 billion is expected for the third consecutive year .
flight centre shares increased by 3 cents yesterday to $ 38.20 .
schools will become more focused on mathematics , spelling and grammar .
in courses on english literature , students will have to learn at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyrics and contemporary british novels from 1914 .
the examination also includes “ unseen texts ” to help wider reading .
the combined course is composed of english literature and language .
from 2015 , students must take an independent gcse exam for language , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new english and mathematics curriculum – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other nuclear areas will be modified next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will be known for a reorganization of the gcse structures , including a new bending system and less course work .
in a speech in the summer , education minister michael gove said that there is “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that gcses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
by contrast , australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in singapore are given 138 hours .
there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the timetable , but for coalition circles , it is said that the comprehensive mathematical test – combined with a greater weight of the subject in the ranking system – will be combined .
the curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathematics .

if people in the past had known too much about this in the past centuries and had taken pictures of heaven and hell , &quot; which have shaped our imagination to date , &quot; the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the world is characterized .
&quot; the greater hope is christian through the religious critique .
she &apos; provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation signs had come to us &apos; .
johanna rahner continues : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . &quot;
this is linked to the question of the longing &quot; dreaming that everything ends well &quot; .
johanna rahner , born in baden-baden in 1962 , studied catholic theology and biology at the albert-ludwigs university of freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .

illmensee : second mountain bike race will delight participants with a lot of fun .
in beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to illmensee to complete the round course on the hill chains around the lake .
this is what ulrich knobel from the organizing sports association illmensee tells .
the participants included , in particular , the short distance of 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , numerous bikers who had their hobby in competitions .
two german top junior riders were also at the start of this race : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from aach-linz came up with the recommendation to take the german championships .
these two could , as expected , be declining from the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader managed to save a small advance into the finish and defended his title as overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pascal was again able to be fiducibly placed .
the ladies were teresa duelli of the team nightmare , which made it to the top of the winning staircase .
in second and third place anne adel from illmensee and leonie drivers from owingen .
a positive development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municipality .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .
the age structure was also very high in the last 70 years , at the youngest and more than 70 years , among the oldest starters .
in the main race this year even more absolute top athletes were on the start .
four drivers were able to resist the regional top drivers .
among them philipp pangerl , a mountainbike semi-pro from the black tusk racing team .
pangerl and his team team team cooperated two times with world champions in the 12-hour driving .
this year he became european champion in this special discipline .
roland ballerstedt , who has already won two german championship titles in the duathlon , also played his part .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a whimper hit finale was reached in the finish in front of the three-lake hall .
pangerl is the first to race over the finish line .
only one second behind it was the routine ballerstedt who won second place in the overall ranking .
at the same time , hermann and warthmann came to the finish as the third of the overall ranking .
in the women &apos;s rating , christiane cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungle , free medical care and free medical care for the kids
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance in remote villages in cameroon .
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .
there are not many doctors in the west african country , just one for 5,000 people , only one for 5,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can be a top 10 vote for him or any other hero to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle saw his sick father lose his consciousness and became hospitals , which were not equipped with the means to help him .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in an accident near yaoundé , the capital cameroon .
he had only one broken arm at first , but then a inflammation was formed that was related to his brain and was able to cause a hematom there that would cause him to be infected for the rest of his life .
“ there was no neurosurgeon in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we would have got it out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years trying to turn his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to seek treatment , which she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bwelle .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes from the main shopping street and the main shopping street .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwelle &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there was a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see bwelle decided to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which is travelling to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday he cows and up to 30 people are in minibuses and ride with the snow-covered medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help .
not always , everything goes smoothly .
once again , they have had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .
but when they arrive , they will be received like heroes : a banquet , singing and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – is happy to be at the happy party .
the next morning the team starts examining hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says bwelle .
they come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and this on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are accused of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school , but that many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the procedure , patients are up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and disinfection equipment is provided by the group generator and thus bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning hours at the company .
it is a strenuous pensum , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
&quot; they are drumming all night , so that we can remain awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday the team will go back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – conducted 700 free operations last year , knowing that they had made a huge difference in their work for the people to whom they helped .
a man explained that the free operation of a broken post he received now allows him to rework .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” the man said .
besides the weekend clinics and his surgeon at the hospital bwelle also works in private clinics in yaoundé at night .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his charitable activity , so bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who died at drexel university in philadelphia medicine in the second year and voluntarily joined the group in bwelles .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle , this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .
“ we can be in the process of operations where we help to disguise blood or hold the instruments for dr. bwelle , ” explains o &apos;malley .
that would be impossible in america as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their journey to cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material .
once you have arrived in yaoundé , bwelle will take care of accommodation , transport and instruction .
“ he is without doubt a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the cameroon people knows no borders .
for bwelle , the almost constant work is not a burden .
to help others to live happier and thereby fulfil a promise he made to his father gives him great pleasure .
“ i am so happy to do this work , ” says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he will see what i do .
i do it to bring people back to laugh and to alleviate the pain .

excellently mastered the fight
the role of the santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , horst janson is cut to the body .
janson himself is an old hate in his profession , the art of acting .
the old man santiago cannot be fooled by fishing .
so the two simply complement each other tremendously .
it is almost assumed that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman speaks manolo , can be seen .
when santiago tired of life , sitting on the chair , janson eht .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is completely a character role that janson excellently manages .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately , through his knowledge and his will , fought against the fish .
janson is widely considered the sole actor on stage .
he manages to attract the audience ’ s attention , so that his monologues do not have a moment of boredom .
his efforts to finally bring the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made of blue illuminated water bottles .
director jens hasselmann is leaving the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he brings the active scene into light : the hut of santiago , the bar of singer marie-luise gunst , the bar , which with her songs and her splendid voice the life of kubas .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the town of cologne is a sewage canal from the roman age , which is about 120 metres long .
if you visit cologne , don &apos;t miss the cathedral .
the two towers rise into the sky about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers , suspect that there are also a lot to discover under the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in the subject of cologne unterwelt .
the service centre of cologne tourism is the meeting point for its guided tours directly at the cathedral .
the tour begins quite unspectacular : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city ’ s fathers wanted a car-free city , and therefore remained only the standing of the remnants of the old city wall , which was not too big .
most users of the multi-storey car park are therefore also rushing past the remains of the roman empire and only park their car .
but if you look more closely , you will find a metal mesh separating archetype in the park deck d2 .
the ruins of the paleolithic stone are about five metres high .
&quot; there are remains of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; says schulze .
before it goes back to the light of day , schulze is leaving the participants at the upper level to take a look at a dark , 15 meters deep shaft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly seen .
the next stop of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants get back into the depth .
we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the precursor of the ccaa .
what ccaa means is that a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which means &quot; city of roman right and city of agrippina , founded under the name of lausanne .
and the pretorium is the former palace of state , the center of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the foothills of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman sewage channel is maintained here on about 120 metres in length .
&quot; you can quietly play a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want , &quot; schulze cheers the guests .
schulze is a surprise .
after getting the key at the checkout , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was used for ritual washing .
to this day , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , has been marked by varying levels of the rhine .
the mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the town hall square , for which construction will begin shortly .
however , a few years will still be passed before completion .
leg almost chopped : recirculation of rocker process
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu will be rerolled after more than four years .
a trial of attempted death , dangerous physical injury and material damage against two thirty years has been tried by the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the defendants remained silent .
they should have been active in the rocker scene and were then among the bandidos .
the public prosecutor accuses you of having to work in finowfurt with unknown accomplices in june 2009 on three men in a car and have taken it upon them .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
the victims are to become the competing group of hells angels .
one is said to have been a high-ranking member from berlin .
it seems that a hunt had been preceded by several cars .
the charges have been levelled at battles and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were acquitted in the first trial in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it was impossible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice rejected the judgment after the public prosecutor &apos;s court had reviewed the court and referred it back to the court of land for further trial .
one of the defendants is currently open for another offence .
the first was the reconstruction of the processes in the actual night .
as a witness , the commissioner to be identified at the time was charged .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had intercepted the police .
the difficulty is that rocker almost always appealed to a law that they obey - not to say .
the same applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been packed out .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last trial .
eleven other days of negotiation have been set for the process .
the throwing away society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the belly of the people on the front-passenger and back-seat hunger is felt .
of course , some cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this !
what is more obvious than chilled to go to the next drive in order to get a little bit of fun ?
i admit that i am happy to be there when there is late night or early morning at fastfood .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix like back home and into bed !
but on the home road , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco fans are noticeable .
what can you fail to be able to keep your fast food bag on a regular basis ?
the weekend is a great place to have a discarded bag of paper on the streets and on parking lots .
&apos;why ? &apos; i wonder .
are people too doof to respect the bags home with respectable until the next dustbin ?
it is not just that the paper product has shunned the landscape .
the bag has already covered up traffic facilities such as traffic control panels and caused accidents .
what does that mean by the said &apos; disposable society &apos; but not &apos; , it probably does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly .
there would be a few bags of bags that would be more or less nix - unlike the street where no one can sit on the food residues of other rummels .
i can see that the day is coming when cities and municipalities are being blocked - and the fast-food policy is being used for their bags .
obama ’ s health retreat
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday backfired on his oft-repeated , clear promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insurer received a letter of termination , the republicans threw a warning to the president over the last few days that he was deceiving the american public .
yesterday , obama relatised his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on dismissals , obama called on the americans who received such communications to seek a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheaply than predicted .
“ they come a better deal , ” he said .
the government found it unsurprising that the five percent of the population who had taken out insurance themselves were looking for a different tariff , because their contract did not meet the new standards after the affordable care .
“ i would like to say to these americans directly : they deserve better , ” said sebelius at a hearing before the european parliament ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the affordable care act , explained that the start of the online platform since october “ miserable ” was miserable .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain their trust .
this phrase of an upset sebelius to a consultant behind her at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative &apos;s house was rejected after a dispute with the republican member , billy long .
after more than three hours of hearing , long sebelius repeatedly begged the question of why the “ architect ” of the affordable care act could not be voluntarily transferred to a government-sponsored insurance .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air base does not confirm attack on syrian air base not to be an air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel cnn on thursday to the effect that israeli fighter planes had planed an air base in syria one day earlier .
the aim is to have &apos; rockets and equipment &apos; , which the israeli government feared would be detrimental to the lebanese hezbollah , said the president of the cnn .
syrian and lebanese media and the arab al-arabiya station had previously reported that the base in the port city of latakia was closed on wednesday night , thursday .
the israeli television channel channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in latakia , on which russian missiles were deployed in the s-125 newa and a battery of sa-3 missiles .
insecurity the government of jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes an equally anonymous israeli government official saying that he believes that israel is carrying out the attack , but that it is not sure .
a israeli defense minister spokesman said , in any case , &apos; we do not comment on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth that the syrian regime had already , or has been successful , tried to launch ground air missiles .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by syria to use hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be a threat to the passage of a &apos; red line &apos; .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that the us spying is “ unreasonable . ”
john kerry suggested with an unexpected admission that the deflation of the us stance on the country ’ s surveillance programs would be softened by saying that espionage was “ unreasonable in certain cases . ”
the foreign minister also admitted that he was deceiving himself with barack obama in the responsibility of being “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of whistle bloom were uncovered .
the leaked information has turned the us government into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .
in a video interview speech at the open government conference in london , kerry said : “ there is no question that the president and i , and others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost done by autopilot .
he then became the first high-ranking member of the us government to admit that us espionage has crossed a border , but also emphasized that no rights have been abused .
he said : ‘ in some cases this has gone too far inappropriately . ’
the president is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is being used .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be affected in this process .
kerry , however , insisted that the nsa was a force of good , saving many lives through its surveillance operations .
he added : ‘ we are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to take themselves into the air .
there is radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people , breathing in the air , and attacking governments .
so what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the killing of people , because we have had experience of such plans in the run-up to them .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to address concerns about america ’ s supposed espionage , and to convince europeans of the need to remain competitive in the anti-terrorism effort .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had spoken with representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to get to grips with the surveillance of national security agency .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans are more sensitive to global warming in terms of our joint efforts ” , murphy said , who was a democrat for the first time in the senate and who was president .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of your anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa collects millions of telephone data in europe have improved relations with some us allies , although the head of the intelligence service has said this week that the reports are incorrect and based on a single report .
other revelations quoted from documents passed by snowden that the nsa had taken over the mobile phone from chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james clapper , defended espionage among allies as necessary , and declared that this was common on both sides .
in all this uproar , murphy said that his administration was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact itinerary is still being worked out .
while murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there should be some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes that they themselves have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs to better protect europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that we do not have to be the only ones to spy , ” says murphy .
meanwhile , john kerry is on the weekend for a trip to the middle east and poland to get the resentment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

australian is appealing against a prison sentence in thailand
a 21-year-old woman from sydney who was imprisoned in phuket for 15 days because she mistakenly claimed to be arrested by a taxi driver .
stevie rochelle bamford was first tried by a provincial court in phuket on june 15 , a false statement .
later , however , the shooting of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at your hotel after being separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they thought the story out .
she was there in police forces until the trial .
bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a detention centre with a low level of security on the outskirts of phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who has been contacting the canberra foreign ministry for help with his daughter .
tunks declared to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of its daughter and wanted to have them back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that you will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 baht at large .
australian reports have said that they have since moved to the resort of krabi in southern thailand .
the court heard that bamford was being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket and was warned that the government &apos;s appeal would also be used to impose a higher sentence of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of the travel clerk michelle smith in phuket , thailand might try to end its tarnished tourist image and thus make it more attractive .
