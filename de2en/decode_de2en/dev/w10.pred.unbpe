gutach : more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday the new b 33-pedestrian light is set up in gutach .
two sites so close to each other : intention or tortoisesvn ?
this question was clearly answered by gutax &apos;s mayor yesterday .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it secures the school path &quot; , eckert explained yesterday .
the kluser-ampel is safe for cyclists , bus passengers and mountain residents .
the plant officially started yesterday is important for the cruise area sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
we have the museum , two churches , kurpark , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; with the high traffic and pedestrian traffic , another traffic light had to be built for their safety &quot; , eckert says .
this is also confirmed by peter arnold of the federal state council office in offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of gutach every day , of which about 10 % are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; arnold emphasizes .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just before this &quot; , says arnold .
four traffic surveys were carried out , and one roundabout was also envisaged , but because of the narrow in the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße junction .
according to arnold , the choice of location of the traffic light masts was tested before : &quot; by means of an extra charge for us with particularly long timber trunks , we have tested whether these vehicles from the sulzer .
the traffic light system , which costs about 15 000 euros , is the &quot; most modern of all , which is currently on the market &quot; , explained arnold .
the system is equipped with coloured leds that lend so strong that the lights are lit by the drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .
and it is also economical : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three lights per direction .
arnold explained the technique of the new system : this one is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian pushes the traffic lights , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pedestrian comes directly green , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go out on the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely via the road , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , motorists must think together and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , a superclass vehicle noise through - at bright red .
josef winkler has been working for more than 30 years to relieve the plight of his childhood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the tendency to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the close and joyfulness - disappeared the carinthian poet many times .
the büchner prize winner is known mainly as a prose author , theatre texts are in his work rar .
collage from prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents &quot; meteorological luminaires on tongue tip &quot; , which is now available in garage x on saint peter &apos;s square .
the theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot; the serpent &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosaminaturium from &quot; corpus , his family &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirement : a cracked and untilted sofa , where the impression is given that the sound is being mapped , hangs over the eight-head head .
director fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .
the 70-minute performance overtones the template with a wealth of director &apos;s injuries , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play .
the actors in particular come to the stage in sometimes rather questionable scenic transpositions .
they are hard-pressed , they are dipped with their heads under water , they are torn to the wall with their evening robes .
enveloped in cellophan or migs , they stack on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologue them loudly or lie silently on the stage floor .
the text is barely mediated in this hard-working way .
the best moments is the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from deep purple to folk song .
only towards the end will the overturned performance become a bit of a rest , and winkler ’ s absurd humor is flashing .
a blackbox in the car ?
american street planners are looking for a source of money to break the declining highway system , and believe the solution in a small black box .
the devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial washington attempt and the planning offices of the states that are obsolete systems for financing us military operations .
this normally boring area of road planning has suddenly opened an intensive debate with colourful alliances .
libertarians have joined with environmental groups and advocate that the government should use the small boxes to record the kilometres that are being driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate the costs .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay for each mile they drive .
thousands of motorists have used the tachographs , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring , already .
this is a really must for our country .
“ it is not something we will use only possibly , ” hasan ikhrata , managing director of southern california said .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , financed from taxes , is the american investment in the fuel dispensation .
but america is not dancing as much as it used to be .
cars consume less petrol .
the national tax on mineral oil of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians dare not to cut the tax even by a cent at high prices .
“ the gasoline tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert in traffic legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tachographs that would allow a mile-based payment system to be tested .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .
not surprisingly , urban liberals embrace the idea , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behavior in such a way that congestion and harmful exhaust gases are reduced .
californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to help the ambitious , legally enshrined goals of the state on climate change .
but bill shuster , a republican of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also said that he has the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the distance they have travelled .
“ this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of policies at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , asked congress to move toward a mile based settlement .
the us senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that includes 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move , responding to concerns expressed by rural meps representing people who live in everyday life .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving on their own .
the most committed is oregon , who currently has 5,000 riders for the country ’ s biggest experiment .
these drivers will soon be paying the mileage charges to the federal state instead of the tax on petroleum .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , to which the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently investigating how .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where 50 volunteers have recently been equipped with the equipment , motorists were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of their movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” alauddin khan , head of strategy and result management in the ministry of transport of nevada , explains .
people did not want it .
when the test was launched , the nevada aclu warned on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to convert the tachograph into full-fledged surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a giant , bulky technological infrastructure that inevitably leads to the use of data on the daily movements of individual people .
nevada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will enable the state to capture the miles that are driven , but not exactly when and where .
thus , according to khan , the public would also be more reassured .
hunting for this technology has made some authorities into a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally set up to help states in taxing drivers .
rather , it was their goal to remain competitive in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are being held on the basis of the miles they have travelled .
but the devices it tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” ryan morrison , managing director of true miseage explained .
some of these public pilot programmes have made big mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon , the planners experiment with offering drivers a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without gps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average travel expenses of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by using the devices with more functions than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax-taxing device that can also pay parking fees , insurance only for driving kilometres must be paid , and speed data from other vehicles are collected in real time , thanks to which they can be evaded .
“ drivers would be more vulnerable to the benefits that the system offers , ” says the president of the commission , “ the added value of drivers .
some transport planners wonder , however , whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction .
the metropolitan transportation commission for the san francisco bay area announced that officials who had been in the congress could solve the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too can pay a fair share .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough , ” randy rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission , explains .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .
königsfeld : small team is wacker
the voluntary fire brigade managed to get its autumn main test through a lack of personnel .
only eleven people participated in the exercise .
he was the commander of the department of the ancestors of the estate in burgberger straße .
the sawing process should have a short circuit .
the resulting fire and smoke caused injuries to two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two breathing protection carriers of the armed forces made themselves felt after the first review of the situation by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the first person was found and led into the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as it was also possible to cross a narrow staircase .
the building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
there were also electric machines for wood processing .
the first extinguishing occurred over the tank in the vehicle .
another line was made from an overfloor hydrants at about 100 meters distance .
now three ransom attacks could be designed .
the building also used a cave blasting tube .
hans kammerer also tried to show what was available with little money .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the daily operation group königsfeld .
the commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and companies
during his visit to the district of breisgau hochschwarzwald , the country ’ s president guido wolf was also able to enlighten the future of the workforce in titisee-neustadt .
in the hochschwarzwald support centre , he went to the management of the vocational schools as well as the district gymnasium and the parent advisory board chair on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , claudia stehle , director of the hans-thoma school , emphasized the networked school project &quot; hochschwarzwald &quot; .
wolf impressed himself with the model projects for education .
since 2011 , a successful cooperation has been established in the forest town between the förderzentrum , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre .
he also praised the family-friendly nature of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to take a look at the period of care for relatives due to demographic change , &quot; wolf said .
he also said that more and more employees are looking after and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting workforce burden could lead to an end to working relations , &quot; said wolf .
but no one can afford to lose skilled labor , he said .
another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .
&quot; because anyone who has already experienced the advantages of the region during his studies will be able to keep up with the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; the president of the country demonstrated .
only if there were sufficient training places could the need for skilled workers be met .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in south-west germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of progress on his train journey from tititisee-neustadt to freiburg .
&quot; stay persistent and make sure that the public transport system is better , &quot; he said to the attendant local politicians .
enjoy an entertaining afternoon with music .
the kaul family has been inviting dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and then a vesper for 15 years .
in the past , the elderly were served in the resting place .
meanwhile , this afternoon is taking place in the nursing home of st. josef .
the home-dwellers enjoyed the delicious cakes and cakes .
later there was sausage salad .
with popular melodies silvia kimich-bantle and her father karl kimmich entertained .
the over 100 years old stone wall , the front demarcation of the old school building to the kirchstraße , which is standing in front of the renovation , is to be put back into the city bräunlingen .
in the days before kilbig , the first work of rehabilitation of the front school court was erected a small wall , to stabilize and relieve static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .
the next step is to remove alexander misok from bräunlinger stadtbaumamt , the national monument office , and to develop a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation will be carried out by experts who will then be notified to the municipal council to decide and determine the way forward .
a decision on this will probably be taken as early as next year .
after the rehabilitation , paving and planting of the old school building inside the two sides of the school built in 1912 , the school must be reconstructed in the foreseeable future as a follow-up to the wall for renovation .
the historic , one hundred year old fortification wall of the old school building to the church street is mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , and has a bow curtain .
deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .
a stable wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which has been done through the current fortification work .
the school court renovation was even planned in 2008-2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure resulted in a postponement .
an important word in the historical restoration of school walls , which has even been used for film recordings , will be taken on board by the national monument office .
if the targets come from this side , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the monumental preservers .
the students of the bräunlinger elementary school , which is now back in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula , can soon use the old school yard .
ozdemir wants to receive jazz training in stuttgart .
in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in baden-württemberg , cem özdemir , federal chairman of the greens , has now joined in .
&quot; i think it is wrong to continue holistic education at the stuttgart music college , &quot; said özdemir the stuttgart news .
jazz and classical music are part of the jazz location stuttgart .
this is a contradiction between özdemir , who was chosen in stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , and the green red government .
this is a step forward in the reorganization of the five music colleges in baden-württemberg , based on an expert study .
the programme will then include jazz and pop studies from the musikhochschule stuttgart to the musikhochschule mannheim .
u.s. border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling
on the mexican border with the us , investigators have created a &apos; super tunnel &apos; for drug smuggling and have decommissioned .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long pipe between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and an aeration plant .
three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .
according to the data , the tunnel has not yet been used .
&quot; these cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , &quot; said the attorney general of the us district southern california .
duffy , who was looking at the drug gangs , said : &quot; if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug-related crime .
by experts constructed
due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it is designed by architects and engineers and that the construction takes about a year .
the track was equipped to allow electric cars to be used there .
on the mexican side , the access is in a building 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads to the depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres high and a width of 90 cm .
it would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was sentenced to death for the seizure of marijuana .
all three are threatened with life imprisonment as a maximum punishment , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the press conference in san diego continued .
but it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .
this shows the &apos; despair &apos; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sherman of the dea drug search in san diego .
they would do everything they could to get to the us .
no details have been given about the detainees , at least one was mexican , as they were told .
they must expect prison sentences of up to ten years .
2014 is the year of the geisinger feast
the jubilee of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
return of the first reference to documents is drawing ever closer .
if the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year will come .
the church was built in 794 for the first time by the holocaust and the church house .
a document was produced in churches mentioning both places .
on 15 march , an official start to the anniversary year is due , and as geissingen does not have a hall at the moment , this opening event takes place in the place where they were first mentioned 1250 years ago .
during the anniversary , several events are held in both geissingen and kirchen-hausen .
kirchen-hausen will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th .
reversal .
on friday with a ceremony , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the kirchtalhalle .
this weekend is also the weekend of the church festival in kirchen-hausener .
city music director rudolf barth has announced a contract for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is being performed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the sonnwendfeier des schwarzwaldverein , on july 12 in the arena with fireworks and on december 13 , the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this will be completed and inaugurated in the year of jubilee , the official appointment is on the last weekend of september , on 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the geisinger city anniversary , a new chronicle is also being released .
&quot; but it is not just a chronicle of hostages themselves , but a printed work about today &apos;s hostage-singing , which is made up of geissingen , kirchen-hausen , leipzig , fingers .
and today ’ s geissingen is also celebrating 2014 birthday , in 1974 the modern space was completed with the involvement .
the new chronicle will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
2014 is another year with many jubilee years .
the foliage of strahglonki begins on february 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony gutmadingen is being 90 years and has the banquet on march 29 and march 4 .
the leiphrdingen plant is 40 years old , the geisinger schule has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on may 10 , the polyhymnia leiphrdingen music association is 150 years old and celebrated .
the city of geisingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monastery of st. gallen in 764 for the first time .
the document was produced in churches ( hausen ) , which was then a court square .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .
reason 2014 of this 1250 year old to celebrate accordingly , in addition , the municipal reform is 40 years old .
rat aims to develop railway systems and to develop rail systems .
should the railway crossing be reconstructed &quot; on the deer &quot; in order to increase road safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach must provide eur 220 000 for this .
deutsche bahn is planning to open the kinzigtal railway line next year .
in particular , it aims to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular conflicts between trains and other vehicles throughout germany .
if the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must contribute with a third of the costs , the rest are divided into the railways and the confederation .
schiltach ’ s city builder roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the bahübergang “ am hirschen ” .
the city plans to build a new railway station in the same building as the tunnel mund to the west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those transporting longwood , could also be standing there in return without having to block the tracks .
greek people therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city would be able to extend the road that followed in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed controversial in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for road traffic : thomas kipp , by expressing his opinion , brought the sentiment of the critics to the point : &quot; do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? &quot; .
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; is regularly used for long-timber transports .
even wood from the area &quot; kuhbach &quot; is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long do not have the possibility to use the route at the häberles bridge because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a route for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel if the main road is closed , hamas. the road is a good example of this .
it is to be expected that kirchberg and schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and rebuilt , as is currently the case in wolfgang , that the railway crossing &quot; am &quot; hirschen &quot; could also have a significance for a longer .
the councils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned broadening of the road .
despite this , the majority of the members of the european parliament have agreed to the restructuring of the railway transition , with the requirement that the necessary support walls be built so that the city can use the next road towards &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at gerberia trautwein could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which could hinder access to the soaring &quot; geroltzhäuser &quot; .
the administration had taken over the railway restructuring plans from the engineering firm breinlinger , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser was possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the tilt of the road could lead to longer vehicles being placed on the road .
the city is responsible for this as a road loader .
the reconstruction could therefore lead to disputes regarding liability .
since both the logging and the bending in the current state of the construction work worked , the rebuilding of the railway crossing should not be agreed , haas argued .
the risk of a collision with a fixed rotor on the passing vehicle is much less than that of the other rail crossings , because the central stop is right next to it , with a good visibility connection .
even trains from the central station would have to be braked to the point that there is no threat of collision .
the majority of the people refused to approve the change of the railway crossing , since the city of schiltach had to &quot; bathe out &quot; the problem with vehicles sitting on the site , as the railway was closed down after the construction work had been completed .
the board considers the reconstructions at the railway crossings &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; vor kuhbach &quot; , for which the crossroads with the railway have already been made .
esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions of dollars of space missions : missions for billions of euros
far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will be starting in the coming years .
thirty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
far from the world .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : to look for gravity waves .
or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or search for earth like planets , and thus discover alien life ?
these are the questions which the european space agency , esa , is currently in charge of .
for your program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is about eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the european space research elite met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were under discussion , five of them now have come to a close vote .
many bodies are considering the proposals to make a few changes to researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
in total , four major questions have been selected by the esa , to which the missions of the cosmic vision programme initiated in 2007 should find answers .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?
the exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that encircle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
in order to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; , which is supposed to be used to transport 500 planetary systems already known to us in the vicinity of the planet , is to be launched in 2017 .
but the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , thus looking for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered to be indications of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , should ultimately be considered as to the conditions for the creation of life .
magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be exemplary .
with the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; , the esa has already launched a m-class mission ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .
the probe is scheduled to start in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
jupiter and his monks are also of great interest to researchers .
you want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .
the esa sees this as the first of the three l missions of the cosmic vision programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 2022 .
after eight years , she reached jupiter and was supposed to be the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to study whether the known nature laws are always there .
perhaps there are also deviations that will show physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it made of ?
our cosmos arose 13.7 billion years ago through the big bang .
besides the matter we know from which stars , planets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gravity galaxies and galaxies are galaxies .
so far , researchers have neither known what physical laws are in the first fraction of the big bang , nor what is darker material to be derived from .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the esa has already approved a m mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
the probe is to be used to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thereby providing a basis for the composition of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
the best chances for an l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a challenging concept for detecting gravitational waves .
this includes physicists ’ changes in the structure of space time , which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could manage this , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in space .
unlike plants on earth , it could also prove gravitational waves that are not present in the big bang , thus gaining new insights into the cosmos ’ development .
four more proposals still compete to the second l mission : a large x-ray sensor called &quot; athena &quot; , which includes black soles .
some of the suggestions for the return of samples from mars , for research into the moon , venus and asteroids , as well as for solar physics , have already been withdrawn .
snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with germany in terms of us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to promise to be on board before the german parliament if the american national security agency and its director do not provide replies .
german mep hans-christian ströbele met snowden in russia on thursday , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent to the media in berlin on friday , he wrote : “ even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government is treating a dissent as a staunch opinion .
but to say the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the american government to drop the charge against him .
the prosecution brought by the us department of justice includes espionage and theft of state property .
german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said to time online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to speak with german representatives , we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us-germany relations are burdened by the claims that the nsa has not yet used chancellor angela merkel ’ s mobile phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that it was necessary to seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness if this was possible , ‘ to endanger relations without jeopardising them ’ and to completely break the us .
ströbele , a green mep , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was accompanied during his visit to russia by two german journalists .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee , snowden could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snowden in germany says , then he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable member says .
snowden explains in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and ongoing ” persecution , which he has launched from his home country .
it is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have been broadly monitoring revelations of an uncontrolled system of surveillance as a virtue of the public .
in his letter , snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the german authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
frontier airlines charges hand baggage fees .
frontier airlines plans to purchase up to usd 100 from passengers travelling on their flight hand baggage .
frontier airlines intends to pay up to usd 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even if the announcement on wednesday was read that passengers were not allowed to use the whole dose .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags below the seat are still free .
frontier said that you will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 for travellers arriving at the gate .
fronter speaker kate o &apos;malley said the charge of $ 100 targets to move travellers to the pre-paid by the payment .
“ we don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines started to work for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to avoid them therefore have as much as possible in their hand baggage , which means that they have to leave the luggage compartments above the seat .
charges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it concerns the most loyal customers of frontier , who would have clearly said that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the frontier platform may bring one piece of baggage with him free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate .
the new frontier hand baggage fee will only come into force in the summer , and there will be no exact date yet .
passengers often swallow baggage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .
many on wall street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most , however , have so far left fingers of charges for hand baggage .
spirit airlines inc. was the first to charge hand baggage three years ago and later , allegiant air , also received a low-cost airline .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , said the airline consultant jay sorensen , who is closely following the extra charges .
in a report of december 2011 , he estimated that the hand baggage fee spirit will bring in usd 50 million per year .
sorensen , who formerly held a leading position at midwest airlines , recently joined the group with spirit and was curious to hear what he had to say at the gate .
“ the boarding process was one of the most frictionless i have seen in my career in aviation , ” he said .
i expected to see tame and tangible discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding ran as lubricated . ”
frontier also follows spirit in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , limonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers who buy lemonade or juice should retain the whole can and drink coffee for free .
water is still free .
in 2008 , us airways had attempted to make money for soft drinks , but this made it back seven months later , after passengers complained and had not received any other large company .
frontiers step to charge for hand baggage if passengers are not directly buying from the airline is the latest initiative to allow customers to check their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy them directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
however , frontier has gone furthest in this area .
in september , the company started to make half as many frequent flights when booking through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight .
a flight tour booked with a third party supplier with frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers may also only book seats when buying them directly on the frontier website .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its denver headquarters , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .
revenues fell by 9 % and flight capacity fell by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic airways .
republic has tried to finance the financial of frontier in the context of the sale of the company .
proverbs come from the bible
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the house of the municipality was &quot; bible proverbs &quot; and &quot; medieval words &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lecture on the biblical proverbs after breakfast .
&quot; proverbs contain wisdom , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible places and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs like : holzzzeige sehen wachst , wie schuppen von den augen , ehren an eye at someone who gives his man &apos;s sleeping , wash his hands of blame .
the speaker also advised her listeners several times what the saying was .
the words of the middle ages were taken up by the church councillor , christel dehner : all good things are three , make blue , make something hawk .
she explained the meaning and origin of the words they call &quot; bridges to the past &quot; .
the raffle was finally lost .
the prices were on a table covered with humor and were encoded before they were handed over to the winners .
the breakfast was very good and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
the first german railway company to start a pilot project for the tourism industry at the mecklenburgische seeplatte .
under the leadership of the german labour agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotel and catering professionals over three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses end with degrees , &quot; said carmen wiechert , the neubrandenburg employment agency .
the benefits are varied : it would not make participants unemployed , firms would have trained professionals who would be increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid paying for unemployment .
the project also involves the chamber of commerce and industry in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( dehoga ) mecklenburg-vorpommern .
nsa explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website .
the shadow national security agency declared late on friday that a bug had caused your public website to paralyse some hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was unreachable for several hours this night , because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail sent to the server .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( ddos ) was not true .
in the early evening , online server trackers had noticed that the nsa website was not reachable for at least six hours and that this is still not for some users .
previously , a nsa speaker had declared to abc news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not compromised in any way . ”
secret information is not in danger , the spokesman says .
at least one group of hacktists claimed to have the nsa website loaded with a ddos attack .
in such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to interfere in the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no such agency , is now in the light of the public and sees itself as the most important in recent months .
the growing controversy surrounding the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .
a slight decline has occurred in the number of people without jobs in october , by 22 to 1,307 .
although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and better than it was in september , &quot; we had hoped for more &quot; , says monika felder-bauer , deputy head of the agency .
many companies have reacted to attitudes .
one reason is , according to felder-bauer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
since september , the number of staff in the hotel and restaurant sector has increased year-on-year .
in mid-december the winter season begins there .

the loss of profits in bombardier after a fall in supply and orders
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc announced a 15-percent decline in net profit on thursday after having been hit by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand-new aircraft of the cseries , nor did it provide any new information as to whether the aircraft will be ready for commercial use next september .
the aircraft will be flying in the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase will proceed as planned .
the results were less than forecasts , leading to a fall in the price of more than eight percent on the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperformance ” on thursday to “ sector performance ” in view of the fact that the share will be in the next one to two quarters .
“ while weaker delivery numbers on aircraft were widely expected , the margin in transport has not been fully disappointing , ” doerksen said in a letter to customer .
we believe that bombardier has received new orders for the cseries when the test program for the aircraft is progressing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the aircraft gravies of the cseries will take the company to the lower market segment , which is currently being developed by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and flew in september after months of delays .
but until now , binding orders for the cseries have been moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for and want to see the results of flight tests whether the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle are sustainable .
there are currently 403 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management also assured analysts and the media that the programme was on schedule .
“ the test aircraft has remained on the ground no longer than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft ’ s stand was subject to ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to add a revision period , which we did .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly afterwards , it was said by the company side .
yet analysts remain skeptical about whether the first customer to fly a cseries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight .
bombardier explained that it is checking the planning for commissioning ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even if you seem to be in line with bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerksen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september , bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged for 9 cents .
sales decreased slightly , and fell from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace sector was 32.9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was unchanged compared to 31 december .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were within the scope of our specifications , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector rose by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on september 30 , and thus slightly increased compared to december 31 .
the profit margin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , new requirements will be set for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoons of trading on thursday , bombardier ’ s share declined by 8.5 % , and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the google finance board changed patrick pichette .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier of the closest rival , reported a 10 % drop in quarterly profit on thursday .

cocain- dependent lawyer who was a drug boss who warned against police investigations must be imprisoned .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information on the underworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .
he was appointed by the liverpool crown court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender , who has to warn a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be exposed , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , provided subworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information on its investigations into its activities in drug trafficking after being threatened by its own cocaine addiction .
the “ first-class ” advocate , with the spitze of “ bash ” , was elected in his house in 2011 , after the scarborough police had supervised the prosecution he had in a prison .
officials watched scarborough ( 32 ) kokain hit three bags at the lawyer &apos;s house in blackburn , lancashire , deliveries to the police while they were in the dining room with waltskammer .
the investigations revealed that ditta regularly uses class a drugs after the tests had left traces of cocaine in his hair , on his letter tap and on credit cards .
for a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he attempted to infiltrate unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then investigated by the police in a major trial of the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had heroin and cocaine searches of 1.5 million pounds of house and 200 000 pounds of cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .
today ditta , who is responsible for the firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , was awarded the liverpool crown court after a three-week trial in two charges for disability .
he gave the cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been involved in their investigation of scarborough and found that he had been in regular telephone contact with ditta in february 2011 .
two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he could return to ditta ’ s home and expose drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove under the dustbin of the wall tonne .
shortly after he delivered the drugs , scarborough regularly telephoned with ditta , who was at dinner in the blackburn rovers football stadium in ewood park .
the lawyer returned home , took the drugs and then nine messages were received between the two .
in court , ditta was announced as a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after a number of class a drugs tests were carried out in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .
ditta was later arrested but withdrew from taking cocaine and said he had to deal with the alleged dealer because he had served as a client , claiming that he was engaged in their discussion .
during his arrest ditta took his wallet and tried to buy a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hair sample .
in the case of police interrogation , he stated that he was running an office and clients would be required to leave his home because of legal matters .
it was announced in court that he was a key player in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , and he had informed us of what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : ‘ a lawyer should know better than anyone else that you cannot break the law ’ .
ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he has been too much involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he has been as much responsive to police investigations as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr ditta has brought his profession into disrepute .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .
ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed : “ if i were a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and information to scarborough would be passed on , i would not wait for 15 hours , but 15 hours . ”
but after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said by the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to catch drugs .
his cocaine dependence resulted in a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who commissioned him to provide valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .
ditta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit of lancashire conducted the investigation against ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases on account of the possession of cocaine and the disability of justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to court .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he was conspiring to become a heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trade .
thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published a section of questions and answers on its website , in which he stated that his dream job was to act as a lawyer in death .
the revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebrations , which took place in the 160-year period , the liederkranz dunningen will host two services with the &quot; deutsche messe &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the musicals &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attracted the audience this spring , the recumbent will be closed at the end of the anniversary year two services of god .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. martinuskirche dunningen and on sunday , 27 october , from 10 : 15 at the church of st. john .

haslach : skepticism is increasingly turning away confidence
the elections to the parish council in 2015 will , for example , have a positive effect on the haslach ( se ) maritime unity .
there is only one common parish council for all six parish councils .
at a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies from haslach , court stetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschenstein prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed , and the parish councils have to make these decisions as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new one is slowly but surely becoming less than confidence .
the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 and concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council were very constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main representatives .
regional dean georg schmitt explained the new guidelines for seafaring units in the archdiocese on the basis of a presentation .
after that , the se haslach as a church community will form a body of public law that is bound up with the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
only a joint parish council and a foundation council will be set up , in which the priest will be represented .
at least two elected members are to be represented from each parish , in the six parish houses so-called local teams are formed .
in future , their role will be to promote the church &apos;s life in the place .
on the question of the finances of the individual parish , there was then a considerable need for discussion .
the innovations provide that accumulated funds in the parish are to be retained for the purpose .
the liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municipality .
in view of the large planned investments , which will then be made by all the parish authorities , there were serious concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only investments were made in projects that were managed by the individual parish units alone , &quot; haslachs parish church council was chairman bro prinzbach .
practical experience with a joint panel for five parish churches , barbar ritter , chairman of the committee of the department of the soul care unit , described debrillant forest neuried .
in 2006 they set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , staying five &apos; and finding that it is not that simple .
the bodies of the haslach soul security unit then set out to discuss the questions on the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work will be further elaborated and will be presented at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
at the end , the parish council michael schöner from steinach presented the new logo of the soul care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is more expensive .
the citizens of pfullendorf must prepare for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke werke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south courier , a four-person pfullendorfer family will pay 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called eec levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is calculated every year in october by the four operators of the large electricity routes .
these figures show the additional costs they will incur from the turn of energy , which they will be able to charge by means of a levy over the price of electricity .
the city works of pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even expected to have a higher levy in its forecasts , as jörg-arne bias reports .
now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we are talking about an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said bias , where the number is more close to the 2 cent .
light on permanent red : wait for the waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not react , or the light symbol is broken .
what should we do then - driving red ?
has a person been waiting long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the stuttgart attorney ralf becker in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which can be interpreted on a case-by-case basis .
becker advises that he should stay for at least five minutes before he can assume that the traffic lights are broken .
if you continue the journey despite the red lights , you must be aware that it is not responsible for the accident that caused it .
those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , becker warns and refers to a decision by the supreme court hamm .
in the case negotiated , a driver had the traffic lights turned out to be ignored after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a careless red red light violation .
the traffic lights were not broken , but soon after they jumped onto the green .
he was not allowed to travel because of the special situation - the fine was not .
the municipal council is pleased to have a solid budget .
whenever local councils discuss the budget , mayor ralph gerster laughs well .
the municipal sack in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and the administration no longer knows about debt since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was clearly demonstrated when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andrea rothmund explained , the administrative budget is more or less eur 7.6 million than planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget is also about eur 1.8 million above the approach .
the surplus is due , above all , to higher business tax revenues and the local share in income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the increased administration budget , &quot; says rothmund .
as less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year , the reserve supply system is also higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.1 million to a total of eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for their good work .
&quot; you don &apos;t just shake a piece of work out of your sleeve , &quot; gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts .
he and local councils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
due to the good financial situation , the municipality has in the past been able to dispense with high heats .
however , according to gerster , this in turn has already been cut off from the country on many occasions .
for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and municipalities applying for subsidies must have certain levies .
&quot; we have to look at the issue of hebels , because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to receive subsidies , &quot; gerster announced in this context .
nagold : hugo wermter has been a chorus for 60 years .
with 60 years as a singer , hubert wermter ’ s story is almost twice as long as the man ’ s singing club , caecilia , in which he was honoured solemnly .
hubert wermter stood in the colours of his men ’ s singing club as usual .
after 60 years , singing with the now more than loved choir still gives him great fun .
wermter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he was awarded several awards for his commitment and his loyalty to the club : jörg kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the cäcilienverband rottenburg-stuttgart , presented him with the award .
his singers gave him the certificate of the german choral association and a engraved tin plate .
the 31st autumn festival was celebrated in the usual way : with the mgv betra , the song wreath salinstetten , the singer ’ s department baisingen and the local music association .
the mgv vollmaringen , with moody songs like &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; funny , her brothers &quot; , opened up a new way of life .
her honorary singer hubert wermter prepared a little stand for her - wolfgang amadeus mozart &apos;s &quot; bundeslied &quot; .
the men ’ s singing club betra also sang classical choir songs like “ jägerwerben ” by julius wengert , “ far away ” by hubert goisern and the folk song .
the song crane salt stetten caused a great deal of concern with his mixed choir and his group of women - the &quot; impulse gate &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed choir kidnapped the neapolitan folk song &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; by antos gus in foreign countries , while the &quot; impulse language &quot; also attacked :
the singer department of the bailinger sportverein came with &quot; what is the swob ? &quot; by hans süsmuth and robert papperts &quot; beer song &quot; back in home filmed .
for the children there was a small program - &quot; oma hanne &quot; alias hannelore stollsteimer performed a castelltheatre and read some stories that the children had been working at lunch .

kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law
“ we are in a frightening situation and one may wonder : what is the view of parliament that it will simply abolish judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was not mentioned in the newspaper , which is not in favour of the draft constitution .
“ the law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , ” said cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , which also includes capital fm , one of the most respected radio stations .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would make kenya ’ s position in the global economy damaged .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is effectively taking a stranglehold by means of the new law “ the media ” , whereas kenya ’ s standard , democracy , and freedom of speech had “ suffered a heavy blow , ” and ran .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at ensuring national security following the attacks by armed islamists on the westgate shopping centre in september .
the kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published footage of security cameras that showed how the hostilities sent to the scene were supposed to be the luxury shopping centre .
david kimaiyo , the head of police , responded by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subpoena was not released after an outcry from the media .
under the new law , media houses can be punished with a fine of up to 20 million kenyan schillings , and individual journalists with up to one million , and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press .
the tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even a single punishment can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”
in addition , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it calls the “ lively blogosphere ” of kenya .
if you silence the media , politicians could do with impunity whatever they like .
“ nobody will ever know , ” mutuma mathiu wrote , a journalist at the nation that has regarded the kenyan media as a decisive factor in public control .
“ if politicians leave themselves alone , they will lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the era of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators have already taken public trouble .
in may , they voted to revoke the cuts imposed by the national compensation commission , and continued their defenceless salaries of around 532,000 schilling .
bad-dürrheim : a dream is true for the fc
the importance of the city and the football club was lost by the official inauguration of the artificial turf sports ground despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant celebration was probably everyone &apos;s wish last saturday , but peter did not want to play with it .
so all those who did not have umbrella or those who did not have one for some reason could not keep it .
this was a very important step for musicians who framed the festival act , as did many speakers .
wet , therefore , the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
his thanks were due to mayor walter klumpp , who has been very committed to implementing the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association , who have taken part .
here , in particular , lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .
the retired , who were standing , laid 400 square meters of pavement stones for the new ways .
this remarkable volunteer commitment was also appreciated by landtagsmate karl rombach .
other greetings were addressed to the municipal sports committee hubert baier , the district chair of the south baden football association , kino kayan , and friedrich knorr from the planning office , the german football office .
mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather conditions were a major factor in the early and autumn lawn , so that it could not be played .
15 years ago , the first consideration of the problem was to start building a third place at the football club grounds or at the real school at salinensee .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thought was given to setting up an artificial turf sports ground , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were made two years ago , when the fc moved the schabelstube into inheritance lease , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country received funding of eur 104 000 trillion .
the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in october 2012 at the total cost of eur 560 000 , summarised klumpp .
the construction of the 68 times 108 meters high artificial turf was started on 4 june .
during the construction phase , which lasted for more than three months , 3000 cubic metres of earth were discharged , half of which were used for the creation of a dirt bike track .
the union and the spd have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of justice and home affairs .
the working group responsible met in berlin on the morning .
among other things , it is about direct democracy , bribery of members and the federal police .
this morning , the migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its work .
this should include the issue of dual citizenship , on which both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd wants to avoid the pressure on immigrant children born in germany to choose one - the union rejects a double passport .
on transport , which was not on the agenda this friday , the spd underlined its &apos; no &apos; to a request from the csu for a car toll .
a vignette is a &quot; flat rate for the multiplicity and thus environmentally counterproductive &quot; , said the spd negotiator for transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
there was a risk of evasion on rural roads , which are already priorities for accidents .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of pronolds .
&quot; there is a danger that compensation for german soldiers will be deleted at a later stage , &quot; he said .

constanz : blocking after an accident at the schänzle roundabout
the accident was reported by the police when a 51-year-old driver from a swiss seat ibiza was driving on thursday evening , at about 20.00 , on the left lane of the two-lane reichenaustraße .
just before the roundabout at schänzle he noticed that he was on the left bend towards stromeyersdorfstrasse and switched to the right lane .

vienna airport makes passenger calls from the airport .
mr max maier , please come to gate 24 .
the new york times will be a great success .
a large proportion of the loudspeaker throughput is thus dropped - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
like our speaker , peter kleemann , announced to radio vienna , vienna airport is following the lead by setting up announcements concerning individuals .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai are already refusing to make the noise .
by eliminating these throughput , on average , around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers every day will sound more calmly at the airport in the future .
&quot; experience has shown that these individual pronouncements have been relatively unnoticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight times or departures is dropped here , &quot; kleemann said in his interview .

overview of milk and egg alternatives
vegan nutrition requires vegetable alternatives to eggs , milk and dairy products .
pured tofu with vegetable cream , for example , is a quarkling substitute .
the other is the world vegan day on november 1 .
the german vegetarian herb is preparing a series of vegetarian alternatives on the occasion of world vegan day on november 1 :
pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter , yoghurt let replace with soyyoghurt .
instead of milk , soy , oven , almond or rice milk can be used .
revolving plant cream substitutes traditional whistle cream .
there are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .
half a crushed , mature banana , for example , can be used to replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake .
50 grams of apple or a tablespoon of grinded linen plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this .
the dough is locked instead of egg with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder , a tablespoon of meal thickness and three tablespoons of mineral water .
but 50 grams of soya yoghurt or silk tofu can also achieve this purpose .
according to vebu , some 800 000 people currently feed vegan in germany , i.e. purely vegetable .
sleepless new york
on the way to their host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the schwarzwald gymnasium students met the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight we went straight to brooklyn bridge , which is the heart of the city , manhattan , on foot .
the view of the world famous skyline was already fascinating , which was the perfect place to enjoy the evening light .
the time was postponed , the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but faithfully the slogan &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; was decided on the day at times square .
despite shutdown , the statue of liberty was reached by a ferry on the second day and could be knocked down on foot .
then it was about the financial center around wall street to commemorate september 11 .
on the third day , the students could enjoy a view of the empire valley from the 373 meter high viewing platform .
after that , the hustle and bustle of new york ’ s streets went through the rockefeller center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to sit down in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the world ’ s daily life at weymouth high school .
this year , the new year will be held on the name-day of saint hubertus in the parish church of st. marien at hulsbergstraße .
st. hubertus was , according to legend , a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of liège .
the hunting horn blowing group of the hunting thirds westphalia , headed by brigitte kluth , is musically involved in parforcehorns ( natural horns in the mood es ) .
the brass wear horse-wear because they mainly wear horse-drawn carriers , horses and dog owners during tow hunts .
the festive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opschlag shines with a new café .
one that invites you to stay and retreat .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
according to the lexicon , déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in case of a visit to the café at the opschlag in kleve , the district town , in sight , to the hochschule rhein-waal , it does not have to remain with pure déjà vu feeling .
after all , the café with its beautiful name is aimed at precisely that : a real stay not only in thought but also in hand-feast to be experienced again and again .
because it &apos;s fun and just beautiful .
a look into the inner life of opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight .
the ultra-modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the team will pamper you with the founders mirjam van der stett and daniel büttner at the top with a variety of coffee or cocktail options .
there is also a delicious cake or individually occupied fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already settled in the hotel before the opening of the beautiful café at opscht as a gastronomic restaurant : in kranenburg they ran the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from the move to kleve to the opscht , the friendly cafe lovers hope to have more audience .
the university of applied sciences is one of the most important institutions of the university of applied sciences .
&quot; although we do not have a specific target group , &quot; daniel büttner emphasises .
the two young students here want to address as much as senior citizens and all ages in between .
speaking of café lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment .
enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations .
expressofan
daniel büttner is more of an expresso fan and mirjam van der steelt the cappuccino trinker .
&quot; a baguette on this - that is my thing &quot; , she betrays the nrz .
two events were also held in the bright café .
in other words , one thing .
the port festival was held outside - the café déjà vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzabend .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps that is another reason why daniel büttner is not a pronounced fan of event evenings : &quot; you can &apos;t make everyone happy &quot; .
and with an event i will only address those who are interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as low as possible &quot; .
the term is : déjà vu also means reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlag in kleve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile , is becoming a very popular destination .
to the delight of many klever , the guests from near and far and the students who enjoy the gastromile and thus also the café déjà vu .

un announces new targets in the fight against poverty
the united nations is now starting to work on a number of new objectives , which will enable the millennium development goals on poverty announced twelve years ago .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in the push for “ sustainable development goals ” that will replace the 2015 millennium .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which was adopted by world leaders , including mrs gillard .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the summit the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to initiate a process that will enable universal , sustainable development goals to be agreed , ” he said .
“ these goals will be based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .
i will spare no effort in remembering the mandate given to me by the member states to fulfil our vision of sustainable development objectives , based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days , the handball upper ligist still has a good mood .
this is what coach tomasz malmon leaves no doubt at all .
everyone is still fully motivated about the matter .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how such a victory tastes , &quot; malmon expects a success experience from his team .
even if the third league reserve from fredenbeck has not yet pulled out trees , malmon has already warned against the time spent in advance .
many players i have trained myself in the a-youth .
therefore , you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex-coach .
&quot; it is also important to see if there is still some reinforcement from the first , &quot; the sg-coach points out .
to return to the bare track of success , the malmon-team must be more flexible than the previous performances .
above all , in the coverage work and in the switching game , it was a huge success .
recovery of opportunities must definitely be improved .
therefore , i hope that my players will finally have their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and the world ’ s most influential figures .
thousands of people gathered in the center of maputo under the alert eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder of state and first president of mozambique to build peace calls in a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
in fear of the country ’ s future , she has turned her business clothes against a t-shirt with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has moved on to the independence square of the capital on thursday .
for two weeks now , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and renamo almost daily , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially led by white rhodesia and later by apartheid south africa ’ s government , in an effort to strengthen the country ’ s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts believe that it is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and locals worried .
the fast-growing economy is at stake , because discovering huge deposits of gas off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could generate more than $ 50 billion of investment from firms like rio tinto , brazil .
the ruling frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and renamo blame each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by inviting its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops renamo bases attacked and tried to attack afonso dhlakama .
the government blames renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .
compared to afp , the french news agency , on wednesday , he said that dhlakama had been seen as a “ loser ” who “ had to use all his remaining forces to prove that he was not doing so .
both frelimo and renamo stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga was quoted in the words that renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .
he said to the ft that he meant that frelimo no longer respects the agreement .
“ our vision is to restart negotiations and to do so seriously , ” mazanga said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults here men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) who are clashing heads , ” says joseph hannon , lecturer at the open university and mozambique .
none of them is good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have described the use of force as an attempt by a sickening movement to impose concessions and financial advantages on the government .
renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) , founded by a former renamo member , is likely to improve .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due to end next year ’ s second term – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says mazanga .
it is unclear what renamo &apos;s capacity is , but it has not stopped unsettling attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , but in which beira is located , the port , the mining companies like rio extinto and valle .
in june , rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after renamo announced an attack on the track .
mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted “ to warn the international community that things are not going well in mozambique , ” said mazanga .
instability has fueled more frustration with the government , says fernando lima , head of mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have been concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ renamo and frelimo are not interested , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he said .
children should regard myths and legends as “ models of life , ” says an author .
the stories of thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
but many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and sometimes too dirty to be taught at schools .
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that authors and teachers who have “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ switch off completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would “ subvert ” .
crossley holland , the beowulf from anglo-saxon and the author of the penguin book of nose myths and the british folk valley , said : “ you can follow certain intentions .
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is in the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .
this must be understated , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
hansjacob is again going to freihof
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob obtained his retirement home in haslach , and on sunday his last years were alive at the &quot; freihof &quot; .
the many spectators were delighted with the extremely twilight scene play .

in order to give honour to the lord &apos;s dignity , haslach &apos;s mayor heinz winkler gave himself the honour to represent the then incumbent , together with a part of the council .
the tri-kings , hansjacob and the triumphal singers then made the exclamation : &quot; oh how beautiful , i will return youth memories to my own triennial . &quot;
with her song &quot; o jesulein &quot; they enjoyed the audience at the freihof as well as storchentagskinder with their loud &quot; out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the congregation had been expressed at hansjakob , as were his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind his grave chapel at the fire near hofstetten , he found his rest place .
&quot; a restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever , &quot; it said at the end of the scene play .
a lot of applause and many praising words were given by the audience for the performance .
basketball : the neckar giant &apos;s hope is growing .
the chances of remaining in league of the sporty descended ludwigsburg bundesliga basketballers have increased .

such an issue could be resolved between states , it was said .

schilles pießen disturbs residents
rhenus midgard has also invested heavily on land .
they are distributing the coal coming from the ships to the pole .
the company has several iron at the site in the fire .
besides coal imports , rhenus midgard also uses wind energy logistics .
black shines the coal on the storefront of the dike .
two massive blue shaft and rear load devices are distributed or loaded the coal here as needed .
every movement of the transshipment takes a sound warning over the terrain .
&quot; the signals are safety and are required by law , &quot; says matthias schrell , managing director of rhenus midgard in wilhelmshaven .
in the event of unfavourable wind , unfortunately , this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the people concerned , says the 40-year-old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures .
he will continue to work on open dialogue with our neighbours .
matthias schrell still has a lot to do in front of the site .
with the expansion of the lower saxony bridge , rhenus midgard continues to focus on the coal import of power stations and is one of the major producers in europe in this sector .
thanks to the pan of the front terminal , which is deepened to 18.5 metres , capesize-bulkcarriers can also be manufactured here .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3-million ton brand in the envelope &quot; , says schreell .
in addition to the eon power station on the ground , the import coal goes to power plants in the interior .
if the gdf suez power station goes on the net , then well 5 million tonnes of coal imported per year will be realistic .
the three ship loaders on the bridge and the second transport tape could create up to 10 million .
despite the first defeat , bavarian basketball is optimistic
even the first defeat in the euroleague was not successfully achieved at the basketball players of the fc bayern munich .

&quot; we have fought incredibly backwards against the second euroleague-champion , but then again , recklessly , &quot; said bayern-profi yassin idbihi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .

ben greenman : ten years new york comedy festival : the new york comedy festival : the new york city festival : the new york city festival : the new york times .
it could be said that new york city was the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : nearly a hundred years ago , the varieteartist frank fay , who was known as conférencier at the palace .
over the years , fays innovation has been expanded , as was the last time at the new york comedy festival .
created and directed by caroline hirsch , founder of the stand-up institution carolines , the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary this year with more than 60 shows .
“ most of these headliners began at carolines and became more successful until they became too familiar at some point to be in a club , ” said hirsch .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event , there are performances by wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher as well as by “ stand up for heroes ” , an annual musical and comedy event .
the festival also has grown the world of comedy .
a number of comedians who are participating in this year ’ s festival have become familiar with more unconventional ways , such as broadcasts on smaller television channels like comedy central , fx and spike .
nick kroll was known with a sitcom on cable tv ( the ironically slipping fantasy football series &quot; the league &quot; on fxx ) and now has his own sketch show .
jenny slate was present at the “ saturday night live ” as well as at “ parks and recreation ” , although they were most famous for their viral video series “ marcel the shell with shoes ” .
kroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , on racial issues w kaumau ) are both kaumau .
the biggest magnet of visitors to the festival is an interview : david steinberg talks with larry david .
steinberg began as a stand-up comedian , but has become a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian .
from 2005 to 2007 he was performing a tv show entitled “ sit down comedy with david steinberg ” on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of manhattan .
“ the city is definitely in the comedy dna of larry ’ s entire work , ” said steinberg .
he told me when he was here , he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : hey , when i lose all my money , i might live here .
iran ’ s nuclear negotiations
iran is demonstrating a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un veto powers and germany , satisfied with the negotiating process .
&quot; after years , agreement has now been reached with the international atomic energy agency to resolve the differences of recent years , &quot; foreign minister mohammed jawad sarif wrote on his facebook page .
it would be a long way off , but the nuclear negotiator was satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution .
drama in uruguay : young kills games chambers with machetes and
two children have died in uruguay the murder of a 11-year-old .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them .
armed with machetes and knives , they are stinging on tuesday the 11-year-old and throwing the corpse into a well , the newspaper reported &quot; el país &quot; on thursday .
they would then have played football before their homes in a working-class district .
the body was thrown in the next night in the village of cerro pelado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach punta del este .
as an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger , who took them with them , should say that she was sexually attacked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police , when the action was taken without mentioning an attack against her , the two boys committed the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .
the older , among other things , called a rivalry in the football match .
he was temporarily transformed into a psychiatric youth institution .
pimps must be jailed
it is not possible to do so because of exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimp , threat , insult and dangerous body injury , that the district court of konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from st. george to three and a half years in prison .
the former german army soldier , who was a turret after two missions in afghanistan , set up a confession in the context of a process agreement .
he has therefore informed women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts , which he has closed down after a few weeks against their will .
he used to break with violence and threats .
the income of women , who have been in some cases for years , for him , has been retained .
by confiscating mobile phones and sim cards , he subjugated women ’ s contacts with the outside world .
together with a colleague who mediated the women , he brought them to various brothels in the south-west .
there he had some monitoring to control their revenue .
in court , the defendant claimed that he was suffering from a severe trauma after colleagues in afghanistan died next to him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert had serious doubts about mental restraint and thus about a limited liability , the psychiatric illness was a major confession by the 33-year-old .
the court did not hear any of the women who were injured .
as a kripo official reported , after a first display , telephone surveillance measures could prevent at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking .
the intercepted talks were marked by high aggression .
later on , the injured would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , in which one of the women on the whole body had discovered blue spots , has not made a statement to this day .
it is &apos; a completely broken personality &apos; , which perpetuates violence and exploitation in this profession as normal .
the defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he had dissolved himself from these circles and he wanted to lead a normal life after detention &quot; , he said .
oil prices continue to rise to up to usd 96 per barrel
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after worries about a high supply overshadow a report that the energy-unfriendly manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference crude oil variety for deliveries in december was available in electronic commerce at the new york mercantile exchange in europe at a rate of 14 cents to usd 96.24 per barrel .
the contract fell by 39 cents on thursday , which meant a 5.8 % fall in prices in october .
the large range of crude oil has been burdened by prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had been reduced by 4.1 million barrels last week .
over five weeks , the offer had increased by 25 million barrels .
but on friday , there were indications of greater demand through two reports of an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this suggests continued economic recovery in china , whose growth is set to reach 7.8 % in the third quarter , after a decline in the previous quarter at the lowest since two decades .
oil from the variety brent , a reference value for international crude oil , also used by us refineries .
court blocked decision on the nypd ’ s stop and frisk directive
a federal appeals court in the us blocked the order of a judge on thursday to make changes to the stop and frisk program ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge shira schuedlin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until a decision was taken on the appeal of the city .
the judge judged in august that the city violated the constitution with the way in which the program for the stop and stop questioning of persons was implemented .
the city laid appeal against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures , including the decision to set up a surveillance office that would help the police in amending its directive and the relevant training program .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge must dismiss the case , since she has not yet ratified the code of conduct for us judges , by specifying that a judge may have the impression of partisanship ;
the judge had ruled that police officers injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were deliberately black and latin american men with the stalling code .
she appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms of directives , training and service supervision , and set up a pilot programme with bodies wearing cameras in neighborhoods where the most controls were carried out .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who have been dismissed after police control .
an oral negotiation to appoint the city is planned after march 14 , 2014 .
the stop and fresh tactics have been used by a number of civil rights defenders .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded checks during the term of the non-partisan mayor michael bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of which were in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men , who belonged to all minorities , were brought to justice , which became a collective action .
advocates of changes to the non-stop and frisk program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police force , as well as influencing the way others operate .
opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morals of the police , but not crime ; they would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to lose thousands of jobs in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet received the stop and frisk practice of constitutionally speaking , but only the type of implementation of the controls by the non-ypd .
the lucky camels of dreams
happiness is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels succeed .
with this bedouin wisdom , the first chairman wolfgang henne described the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the tenth anniversary of the association , which has already achieved considerable success , was celebrated .
the first chairman , mr henne , reported extensively on the work of the association .
he was himself in mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the cheijk-zajed hospital in nouakchott .
as a result , another cooperation developed , and gynaecologist henne performed numerous operations on the spot during several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the inserts were shown on a large screen , so that guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned .
the club ’ s desert vehicle has also been shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
rainer prewo , the former ob of nagold , had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to work as an advisory role at the association according to henne .
in 2008 , zimmerei schleeh from baiersbronn won the hospital in socogim , an misery district on the edge of the capital - honorary .
henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in nouakchott .
especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in nagold is to be weathered .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practitioner , according to henne , for example , de-leveraging against burn-out .
the political unrest in the country has prevented the number of journeys that were planned , but many medical practitioners came to germany to pray in various areas .
in addition , containers are regularly sent to africa with material , such as medical devices , medicines , association material , hospital beds and glasses .
mitinitiator hans-joachim fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local coloration by making it from mauritania from the motogp mercedes-vehicles converted to a mobile goatstable .
when his personal motives were cited as being young mep , he was working in the area of auditing .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help africans control a budget through the people .
fuchtel also stressed that global economic activity also demands human love .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
from gran canaria it is not far to africa .
coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor andy coulson allegedly put &quot; telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation &quot; in an attempt to give a false tip about an affair of the then interior minister charles clarke .
prosecutor andrew edis qc told the court in the old bailey that news of the world had a false rumor in may 2005 that clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser . ”
the newspaper commissioned glenn mulcaire , a private detective , to release pawlby ’ s voicemails , and followed them , but coulson also called them and left messages .
“ according to the public prosecutor ’ s office , coulson , who is now the editor of the notwa , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to tap it in fresh deed , but a story that people . ”
he said that notww use three methods to investigatively research stories : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone hacking ?
he is arguing about this , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew about it ’ .
rumors of an affair with clarkes were first published by the feature editorial of notww , a source that was sexually interested in pawlby , was said : “ don ’ t waste your time .
a volume with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the detective &apos;s computer on which pawlby and her sister were stored as &quot; projects &quot; .
in the time that research was conducted , the grandparents of pawlby received anonymous calls , in which they were asked for information about them , edis explained .
meanwhile , the former chief porter neville thurlbeck and the former reporter of james weaterup oversaw the movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her with a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which i would like to talk about with charles . ”
edis explained that coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities , such as former interior minister david blunkett .
on thursday , the juries heard that coulson blunkett was sentenced to a married woman for an affair , when he himself was charged with the co-accused rebekah brooks .
coulson and brooks argue that they have conspiracy to interfere with others , telephone calls between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have added the telephone hacking .
in protest against the planned imperial tax , french football will indeed be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting will end without result .
in the conflict over the imperial tax , the government and professional football in france have been reluctant to enter a deadlock after a failed conciliation meeting .
president françois hollande , although he received a greeting at the paris élysée palace on thursday , and heard their complaints .
he refused to remove football from the planned 75 % limit on the amount of money he had paid out .
the other side remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of november will now be dragged out , the head of the professional clubs ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , with him .
the new york times , which will take place between 29 november and 2 december , are therefore out of date .
chicken : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in the planning process early on &quot; , mayor jens häußler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flood protection concept in gechingen .
about 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring ideas .
heissler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council &quot; .
the flooding that erupted on 15 may 2009 was a dramatic and unprepared event , which raised the question of protection for the future .
a river area survey was conducted with the neighbouring municipality of aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in gechingen .
&quot; the protection of as many built land as possible is the goal &quot; , says häußler .
the design of the protection against a weather service according to german weather service is based on the statistical data of expected floods every 100 years .
climate change is being taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .
this is achieved in specialist circles by the term &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that caused considerable damage in gechinen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , &quot; says häußler .
to protect the hq 100aklima , approximately four million euros must be invested in gechinen , with the municipality receiving state aid of around 70 percent .
but chieftains pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented .
the community must have the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
at best , 2016 can begin to implement .
among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influx of the river irm from the tribal valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to submit their requests .
among other things , it was questioned why more dams and restraint basins are not planned to protect the place .
gregor kühn , the engineer of the engineering office of the forest and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures in order to achieve the sum .
moreover , one should be held the most economical solution to find , according to joachim wald and corbe .
there was displeasure among altorts &apos; residents , who were under a heavy load even during normal rainfall .
the problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .
however , chieftains pointed out that the channel system directives are different from those for flood prevention , and that this should not be mixed .
the municipality is obliged to design the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration could be tolerated .
the sewage channels to be larger would devour millions .
after the collapse
on the state road 44 near revensdorf , two drivers are driving on the early friday afternoon in a frontal collision .
the police immediately closed the street completely , but at first it could say little about the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .
it is a fact that the 19-year-old steering officer of a vw golf was driving towards revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf came with his hyundai .
both vehicles clashed together , and the woman was so heavily trapped that the fire brigade needed barely half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .
the cause of the accident was initially unclear .
both failed came to nearby hospitals .
the track was closed for about two hours .
one could call it the dostoyevsky of the us .
philip k. dick was a god-seeker , a metaphysicist , his novels and stories also have something serial .
the relationship in the outer world is astonishing : the glistening eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , like fjodor m. dostojewski with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologist of the russian soul , one reads philip k. dick as an american prophet .
some titles have been published by heyne verlag , which produced haffmans cassettes with the 118 stories , selling two-thousandths .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with paranoia , insane security , and the belief that it is selected .
dick had a wealth of experience in the god. his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has already captured early that the computers are divinities .
he wrote a computer theology and asked what a person would be different from a machine that creator had from his creature .
this is the blade runner problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been filmed by film directors such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 1956 , it exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunal .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dicks world , which is appalling to our own , mutants look to the future - and the police are intervening .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not violated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we &apos;ll snap us before you can commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for this we have a flyer full of pesudo criminals &quot; .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dick &apos;s narrative acts as the blueprint for anti-terrorism laws and the nsa &apos;s eavesdropping .
anticipation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dicks story is not over yet .
the chief of police complains that there is no longer any separation of powers , that the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
then the supervisor will be supervised and convicted of a future crime .
the system rotates through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it invents its own preconditions .
does not only accept mistakes and sacrifices , but builds on them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
philip k. dick reads dick , and always means coming closer to the truth .
late hits around merkel in russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden may be in the late us case for chancellor angela merkel to address his russian asylum as well .
representatives of the german lawyer could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 year old in russia personally , the agency interfax reported .
before that , the federal green member hans-christian ströbele was the first german politician to meet snowden in moscow yesterday to discuss the affair with him .
nsa revelations reinforce paranoia of companies because of state surveillance
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep over the us consulate in frankfurt am main , the capital of germany .
on the instructions of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal security service , he should take photographs of the us foreign office ’ s roof , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the bvt wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , again insisted in september that the us had no foreign scoring options , “ to protect the business secrets of foreign companies in the us on behalf of us companies .
but since edward snowden , who became the whistleblower , with the publication of his filler horn to us surveillance secrets , european governments and entrepreneurs have become unaware of the fact that they are no longer taking the word .
reports that the us national security agency has been supplying the brazilian oil company petrobas and gathering data from american cloud providers , including google and yahoo , have been reported by the company ’ s paranoid authorities .
the barrel overflowed with the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone was interrupted , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then management companies are certainly potential targets .
snowden has already demonstrated the close cooperation between us intelligence services and companies in a transparent way .
i believe that it is conceivable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver green , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as much risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey that was conducted by the advisor company ey in july .
snowden documents leaked have not shown any evidence that the us has cut the trade secrets of foreign companies on its own firms .
politicians have expressed their concern that certain it and internet opportunities are lacking in the eu and that they should reduce their dependence on the us .
companies are sceptical about this .
in the bundestag it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them ...
“ this is not working , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software producer sap .
if we had wanted a strong european it industry , we would not have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
however , scope and technical refinement of the information provided by the snowden revelations have not helped firms to shock , which previously had the largest spy rig in china .
cloud computing is changing a lot because european business leaders are more aware that in the us , data from the legal jurisprudence is subject to and potentially endangered .
according to a report published by the cloud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has announced that it has not yet received any notice of the data mining activities in the united states .
jim snabe , deputy ceo of sap , says : “ we are seeing a new question of customers that it was not yet a year ago – it is : where are my data stored and can guarantee them physically ?
many german corporate leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew .
it is no surprise that economic espionage is taking place .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally by the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying us on the commercial and industrial levels , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate governance usually does not boast about the countermeasures that have been taken , because that gives attackers advantages .
large companies have long since introduced the idea that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or unguarded property is a problem for employees .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of audi automobile manufacturers , says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices .
the german bvt advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad , because smartphones are likely to be compromised .
the prepaid phones are thrown away after the event .
there is concern , however , that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche markets .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access , ” the bvt warns in a report .
the us warns its own firms against economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate has seen france , russia , and israel ranked second in the country to obtain $ 350 billion in hackings .
a member of the board of a german blue chip company agreed to the fact that when it comes to economic espionage , “ the french are the worst . ”
bernard squarcini , former head of the french internal security service , dcrl , was interviewed this month in an interview with the following : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they are working together .

kendrick johnson from valdosta in the state of georgia was born on 11 january in a upright matte , which is placed behind the grandstand in the school gym .
the sheriff investigators from lowndes county concluded that the country ’ s military presence was a disaster .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was murdered , &quot; benjamin crump , the kenneth and jacquelyn johnson advocate , declared to foxnews.com.
they would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff slew it .
“ they believe that it lacks logic to violate the laws of physics as well as to common sense .
they are convinced that the truth is being hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the corpse , &quot; he commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
moore said this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in whatever direction they are heading in .
my goal is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for formal investigation exists . ” said mr. berger .
moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that johnson was tied to the consequences of “ position-induced suffocation . ”
but a second autopsy has produced another cause of death , according to moore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of criminal or civil law investigation into the death of johnson , he would be the fbi with the implementation of the investigation .
a representative of the county sheriff authority was not immediately available to comment on our question on thursday .
a court in southern georgia ordered on wednesday that the authorities should check all watch videos , which the investigation carried out was carried out .
teenager ’ s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained hints on how he died .
cdc publish allergy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( centercenter for disease control and prevention ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children &apos;s food allergies in schools .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of children with food allergies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now has food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % , according to cdc , between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who are allergic to it .
it is also recommended that schools have epinephry in stock – the auto injection of the episcope brand is most commonly used – to avoid a potentially lethal hypersensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools of epinephrit can keep it more easily .
the report also contains a list of typical symptoms , which are called by children who have an allergic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is pushing on my tongue , ” “ my tongue feels as if a hair is on it ” or “ my tongue cribbelt ” .
parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender indefinite ” .
germany is the first european nation to recognise a third sex for children who have unequivocal genital genital problems .
newborn children are no longer being inferred by men or women .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender to such children , but can be “ undetermined ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents to avoid hasty decisions on operations for sexual access .
according to bbc years later , an intersexual person said : “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the patchwork created by doctors , maimed and filled with scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is neither young nor girls .
they are among the intersexual , a group that is subject to the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( dsd ) , a concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germs , etc .
wallis simpson was perhaps intersexually .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that you should try to get the best information available on gender allocation if a provision is not possible .
the new york psychiatrist , dr. jack drescher , who has specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ blade after a good thing . ”
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but for most children this is not the case , ” he said .
you can allocate the gender without an operation and then see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .
nobody knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that transsexuals or transgender people are to be distinguished , because their status is not gender related , but through their biological constitutions .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual and mental characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that intersexual and transgender people face in their professional lives and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .
young people who do not agree with the gender have a special camp now .
in the meantime , australia and nepal are able to access official documents by male , female or “ third sex . ”
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender-free ” person after a court ruled that the lifetime of a “ undefined ” gender status had been granted .
in addition to m and w , german cards will have a third allocation in future , x for intersexuals , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighboring france , gender issues are still controversial , such as news reports on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french meps from the strictly catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
the us website catholic online has also opposed german law , on the grounds that “ if the world were to be dragged into a new state , where gender is a decision to take sexual activity but not to commit sexual activity , then it will .
the mother of a newborn from maryland told baby zone that it would be better if babies were to have a gender at birth .
“ parental existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially when one considers the gender of one ’ s child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who have been involved in both male and female sex have been treated as hermaphrodites , according to the attractive greek god , who both sexes had .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be eliminated and then rebuilt .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child grows up with the child &apos;s weight .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called a “ psychiatric emergency , ” said drescher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psychiatrist that was called , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory on the treatment of children with unclear genitals is based on dr. john money from johns hopkins university , who argued that gender is formal .
he shaped the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental stimulus – as parents would have to educate a child – interacted with genes and hormones of a child , and shaped them like that .
but in a book called “ john / joan ” , published in 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was thrown away by a botched circumcision to castrate the child and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , ” says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male gender and married a woman .
at 38 but he committed suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the internet , survivors of these gender operations have appeared to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36-year-old montana author who has worked with xy-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .
doctors were unaware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never be a “ satisfying life ” as a man .
so his external organ and the testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
“ i knew i am not a girl , ” he explained to abcnews.com , and he said to abcnews.com .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal plastics .
but , because he was and was depressed , something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found was shocking .
i was sterilized at birth – and nobody ever told me .
bruce was born with a dsd that did not allow his body enough testosterone to develop genitals .
after learning the truth , he returned to the male identity , received testosterone injections , and let his breasts be removed .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to see intersexual people perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of california ’ s advocates for informatic law group , is providing the best possible service to the german law “ to stamp and stifle .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to allow the child to “ assign ” non-fixed , ” she explained .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to treat the male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organisation supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .
german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a battle to force small children at this time .
if you are mature , you can decide for yourself about your body .
but dr. arlene baratz , a viola diologist from pittsburg , who was a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the german law .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete andro-resistance .
due to the target cells defect for testosterone , katie developed female characteristics .
she has a vagina but not a uterus and no ovaries .
today katie 29 is married and she works at the university of pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist employee .
it is infertile , but hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .
“ the law gives parents space , which means that they do not have to make decisions in haste , ” baratz said .
it gives you time to test different things and to clarify things , giving you time before you are “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you raise the child and loves it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness .
and you do not have to rush into an operation that can no longer be reversed .
“ this includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are upsetting because they believe they are not the right ones to do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make their own choices .
unknown injuries girls by shot
unknown people have a 12-year-old in saxony-anhalt in shots from a car .
the perpetrators had probably been killed by an air pressure weapon in genthin on a group of children on thursday evening .
the police told us this .
the girl had been slightly wounded on the left wade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then drove it .
the criminal police investigated it was said on friday .
up to now , the police inspection kempten has been able to look back at a quiet halloween night .
officials were only called to eaters twice , which warned them against facades of houses .
since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the eggs immediately , no material damage should have been caused .
in addition , some sylvester böller were lit in the city area , but again no material damage was caused .
a resident in the bishop friendship orfer way reported that his car was wrapped in a knob and his wheel aperture was stolen .
until the police arrived , however , the man has his wheel aperture in the immediate vicinity found all again , which is why the police did not have to take any further action .
living with a future
waltraud ries actually lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t have any fear of spiders ? &quot; asked waltraud ries and points to a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time now .
but you know how difficult this is in stuttgart .
the reason is not spider phobia , however , but the concern that at the age of the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be managed , she explains .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the migrant has had to find out for herself what it means to deal with handicap from floor to floor .
a book recently published by her about &apos; happy living at age - what form of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at all in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when they entered the maisonette apartment with their husband more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with the middle of fifty , waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most are pushing it out as long as it goes .
the old people are getting only the others &apos; , she says schmunnelnd .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great are we concerned .
&apos;then it may be too late &apos; , says ries .
in her book the interior architect presents 17 models of living in self-determined living in old age .
&apos;whatever type of living you choose is always an individual choice &apos; , she explains .
d i solution do not give it to age .
even those who wish to retire in tuscany or brittany should always consider that they can also be sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also combine in the dolce vita , &apos; the author of the book gives you the chance to think about people who want to settle .
their models include classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often quoted pensioners &apos; wg .
at age , everyone has his ticks and flakes .
&quot; but for me , such a community would be nothing &quot; , says it with a wink .
not at all like a student wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; at age , you simply need your retreat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a senior community can still function is something that the author does not want to exclude .
but that must be different from the classic student wg .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &apos; she believes .
she is not alone in the capital of the country .
&quot; most of the old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own home as long as possible , &quot; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the citizens &apos; service living at the age of the provincial capital .
your service advises people around the topic &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why elderly people , in particular , would often accept inconvenience and restrictions just to stay in their habitual environment , which is also the experience of the stiftung warentest .
there are many ways to reach the house or the apartment without barriers .
ries recommends that all those who are looking for a new home or home in accordance with the age of their home should first be informed and not be the first to order the best craftsman .
today there are specialists for the conversion of the old building .
even in the rental apartment , some can be realized , and if only the toilet seat increase is the reason , the interior architect will clarify .
but it is not always possible to change the existing apartment in a way that is accessible to the age and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
this experience was what waltraud ries had to do .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your husband .
before moving , she grayed more than before the spider on her apartment door .
the us wants to pursue snowden
the us has not changed its stance on former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he is still being accused of having illegally disclosed secret information .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state department spokesman , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change this either .
before that , german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow to call on the us not to continue to threaten him with punishment .
psaki stressed that the stringent statements are those of a parliamentarian , not those of a german government member .
intelligence contractors edward snowden have been prepared to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this was the case with former nsa staff , who was looking for the us , in a letter that was not addressed to the green politician hans-christian ströbele on friday after a meeting with snowbunden , and published it .
the letter has been translated according to a translation widely used by ströbele :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am called edward joseph snowden and i was previously contracted or directly appointed as a technical expert at the national security agency ( nsa ) , central intelligence ( csr ) .
in my work in these institutions , i have witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government , which have led me to act on the basis of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been exposed to a serious and persistent heat that has forced me to leave my family and home .
i live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which is something the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the united states - have made revelations a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public .
these espionage revelations brought many proposals for new laws and directives based on the previously concealed abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks that have been acquired have been clearly reduced .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a flouting of faith and to criminalise political expression and to prosecute them .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will abandon this abject attitude .
i hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity .
i look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .
edward snowden testifies to the success of hans-christian ströbele .
kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier says .
the former kindergarten in the gartenstraße has sold the commune to a private person .
the sale was approved by the municipal council at its recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , says maier .
the budget was eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlings should pass responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus no longer have to pay for the house ’ s entertainment , like heating , looking out to the garden and watching .
&quot; this effort is gone , &quot; maier is pleased .
concert of the square at high summer temperatures
the musikverein hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the gasthaus hammer .
as a conductor bianca willmann at 7.30 p.m. , the thermometer always shows 25 degrees .
about 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of hammricher musicians .
the chairman manuela honeck explains the music .
in this context , honeck thanked all those who helped to manage the first musical hock successfully .
report : obama campaign considered to replace biden with hillary clinton
president barack obama ’ s closest advisers have deliberated in secret to appoint vice president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : game change 2012 . ”
the times is a copy of the book that will be published shortly and it reported on thursday evening that the tokyo press consultants had “ extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent of the times , the book is a thorough account of the efforts of leading campaigners and white house staff , notably the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chicago and the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including daley , obama ’ s former campaign leader , jim messina , and the former white house chief advisor , david axelffe woud and david .
in double down , it is said that daley was at the forefront of efforts to keep biden alive despite her “ tight personal relationship ” before being able to fight against such a move .
in an interview with martin , daley confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing biden with clinton .
“ i said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” said daley to the magazine .
it should be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought , “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
while daley considers the investigations to be “ due diligence , ” martin said to anderson cooper of cnn that considerable effort was made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move was appropriate .
“ campaigns don ’ t spend so much money on polls and focus groups unless you think seriously about something , ” martin explained on ac360 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had thought about an exchange .
martin said to cnn that he asked daley whether his then boss was aware of the potential change .
although daley said he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for obama to know about it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether political explorations by obama ’ s desk would have reached .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama had not known anything about the investigations about whether to use biden in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin replied .
what happens on the go with my e-mail ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letters .
was e-mail used in the design of the internet service , similar to the traditional post , to transpose the letter secrecy ?
the concept of early internet services was to make communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a hearing safe correspondence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; benni &quot; sends a mail , the computers of the two are then directly connected ?
the e-mail program or the browser of anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , google would be .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that benni uses .
on the route , the mail can run over several other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content from his provider .
if conventional e-mails are read through the internet ?
most mails are read by software robots on the go .
the sender &apos;s provider generally checks whether the mail is a malicious program as an attachment .
on the receiver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
furthermore , the providers check whether this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least converted into a spam folder .
do robots have another task ?
on systems like gmail , the robot also determines the information google needs to place context advertising .
when anna and benni communicate via gmail about their coming holiday trip , google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers .
do unknown people read the emails ?
the probability that unauthorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails .
there are also possible illegal cut-off actions .
is it possible to protect e-mails from reading ?
encryption according to the openpgp standard allows an email to be encrypted effectively against reading .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to hide the metadata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communicated with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the most privately used mailboxes are the subject of an investigation by convios consulting in august 2013 , according to a survey by yahoo and google .
while yahoo-mail ’ s shares were down most recently , gmail was able to increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest disguised and retired
when his mother died , a man from wolfsburg forged a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and continued to pay her pension and care .
to obtain further pensions and care-giving , a 67-year-old wolfsburg has left his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest .
first , he covered up the death of the 89-year-old , then he spent more than a year and a half on the money .
now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as one speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the man was suspected back in may : at that time , the poor mother had no medication .
the pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to spain .
because officials were curious , they continued to investigate .
the two were born in a common apartment for more than 15 years and last maintained them .
the 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an obduction did not indicate a capital crime .
want to have ice cream that lights up in the dark ?
a british businessman has the first ice cream in the dark – with the help of jellyfish .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of sea animals use and created the ideal light for the sea .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and convinced chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .
the ice cream reacts with the tongue during consumption , which means that the ph value in the protein is raised and the light is triggered .
chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ lick me i &apos;m delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it ” .
the protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral ph value .
when the mouth heats the protein , the ph value and the ice brightens up .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to market halloween because it was this wonderful luminaire effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever made , because the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about gbp 140 .
but for that it tastes tasty .
charlies experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , wine , and other products .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says : “ i want to develop an invisible ice cream . ”
this is impossible in itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream is made ; but i suspect we will find a way to create it .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment artificially produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is still in the hands after six days of playing without any point .
it is now precisely for the team of ingo ehlers that the day will be the derby against the tsv daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season starts for us .
&quot; i hope that we will finally have our heads free &quot; , ehlers &apos;s behaviour gives him optimistic .
he has finally done so , with the exception of the enduring hendrik blohme , his entire cadre .
like us , daverden also relies on speed play .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but , first and foremost , we need to increase the coverage , which , at the last moment , has left anything but a certain impression .
the coach thomas panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against nordhorn .
the game was of course a house number .
but that &apos;s why we are not the favourite for a long time , because everything can always happen in derby .
panitz wants to be back in morsum to start a series .
is missing jan-malte jodat .
for this purpose , the young joost windfuß , who is entitled to play double at the a-jugend-bundesligist hc bremen , is celebrating his season debut .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
halloween 2013 : figures
when i was small halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , to stay late and to dress us for the neighborhood .
today i am more likely to become a halloween muffle .
over the last two years i have not agreed to speak of sweets from my home and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but according to the statistics , i am a black sheep as far as halloween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate halloween this year , giving a total of $ 6.9 billion in candy , costumes , and decorations , according to the us federation .
one thing i can rely on every halloween then again is the trend values .
the costumes will cost about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting , inanimate objects are the final cry .
women no longer have to wear sexy clothes , they can now also eat tempting food like pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk space designers will put it into the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates , and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we dressed our dogs last year and were therefore not alone to my surprise .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on pets ’ costumes , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for sweets , we are not zimperous .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
that is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutschers , candies and rubber beards .
so good news for the us department of commerce ’ s 41 million people who are being killed by the saying “ sweet or acid ” in the neighborhoods .
in fact , we will have more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is candy corn , which is sweet , but still 15 million kilograms of it are sold around halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion maize cans .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more like halloween than houses where it spits .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which in fact is a real prison ) , “ howl-o-scream ” and “ the house of shock ” .
there are actually 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the united states that generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you can look in your trousers .
but let us finally get to the cutbacks .
charlie brown made us familiar with the great pumpkin when we were children , and carving a shorter lantern is like decorating the christmas tree – something we learned from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us have grown up to cut the pumpkin and not to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on cutbacks , according to the us census bureau .
the shorter lantern , slowly rotting in the front garden , is probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested .
if you want to score points correctly , call tim and susan mathisdon in napa , california and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo of heavy pumpkin .
the new york times is a new year ’ s eve .
the fire brigade had to be left in helbrecht at the late thursday evening .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins at night to fire on friday .
the rescue forces have a boiled corpse from the house .
rescue forces have a very serious problem with a fire in helbrecht in a three-family house .
whether it is a resident handle is still unclear how a spokesman of the police in bayreuth said .
on late thursday evening , it had burned on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already beating from a window .
the forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room .
this and another room burned out completely .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .
the building was not inhabitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany ’ s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor ’ s profession .
background is a possible shortage of pastors : the evangelic-lutheran church of the state of hanover expects that the number of its currently 1,800 pastoralists and pastors will rise by 30 .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to determine the working and day-to-day running of your own .
the first time the church of the state has built a pastor in a full place , commissioned a young person to inspire them to study theology .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are deciding to study theology after their graduation .
burfia leads this back to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and i can set my priorities where i feel it is important .
pastors , as a soulworm , may be very close to the people .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well of it .
certainly , there is more pay in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
this is a good way to meet the young people of today who are not only concerned with careers but with a job full of senses .
according to the state church , which comprises three quarters of lower saxony , around 60 pastors currently retire each year .
at the same time , some 40 graduates of a theology studies start their vicariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland or wendland , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
burfia wants to host study days for young people and also invite celebrities to study theology .
the theology studies offer a broad education .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .

fire brigade called to save a dog that is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop in a quarry .
ruby cockerspaniel-bitch had run out after a small traffic accident .
three days later , a walker in the quarry discovered it in its unfavourable position .
firefighters rolled down on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death .
the fire brigade managed to secure a dog that was on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was killed after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was released from a quarry on wednesday .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire , to take ruby again .
they had desperately been looking for their missing female and had been calling for help in social networks when they looked for the small traffic accident in the quarry .
about 2 : 15 pm on wednesday , a walker who had to show his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15-meter high paragraph in the quarry .
the technical rescue team of the cleckheaton fire station was on the spot and rolled to rescue rubys , who then moved to a dog fire box .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then had a few dog cakes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a giant slash . ”
they could have been seriously injured or worse .
ruby was investigated as a veterinarian , but he was not able to detect anything except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ watching rescue was frightening . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the firefighters have done a great job .
it was really brave what you did .
we are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keithley added : “ we were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”
the firefighters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mick jagger explains that he never did katy perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said she had been a background singer at jaggers song “ old habits the hard ” from 2004 .
perry explained that she had dinner with the altrocker and that “ he drew me up when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”
in a statement , a representative hunters , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever tried to bring about rapprochement with katy perry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling-stone tour this year .
her new album „ prism “ was ranked # 1 this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice of making the choice
a new day , a new story of terror for independence .
this time we are being warned that an independent scotland is necessary to make the schengen area a condition for eu membership .
this provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in berwick and a story that is secured with barbed wire along the hadrian wall .
in fact , in the strathclyde template , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that would entail more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this did not , as expected , feature in the headlines .
no one has mentioned that eu member states often apply their strict rules when it is beneficial for them .
as scotland is not currently part of the schengen area , continuing non-compliance with brussels would be a small concession in return for what one really wants from the scots .
so , really no story .
and one that has come to be a fossil already in the years : the first time i saw the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story .
why expect an independent scotland to be governed by the european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the one that brussels is swaking up to , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-war plan for the unification of europe has stalled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
throughout the eu , parties that are anti-eu or are using the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could not support alternative to germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the federal election in september , effectively weakening the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british democrat ) .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
because of the strict austerity policies imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in connection with the straitjacket that the national economy is forced into by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the european project is too far-reaching .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has set members on exchange rates that benefit german exporters – and this is what german politicians would like to leave .
without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an built-in productivity disadvantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by berlin .
behind the current etat and currency problems lies a deeper european productivity problem .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by brussels – a code for subsidizing french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – european industry pays a lot of money compared to the united states .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we saw in grangemouth .
all the world &apos;s wage depreciation does not protect the european petrochemical industry from being driven into the corner from cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to shut germany in check and look at paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin needs paris no more than a gateway to political legitimacy and has pressed europe into its own economic policy , which is what the struggling french economy is struggling with .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-wing , anti-eu front national has just won a decisive re-election , thereby pushing the ruling socialists to third .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the british labour party that it is not likely to see a split in the right spectrum .
what makes le pen with its newly won popularity among the white french working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-eu , anti-community monetary bloc in the european parliament .
if anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then such a bloc could dominate the european parliament for the first time .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” the general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may remain stuck with the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of engaging with the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific suggests that britain alone in the atlantic rain will be in the making .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( at last ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including , say , berlin and brussels , what they can bow down to where .
i suspect that scotland could be completely excluded from a looser european union , provided we retain our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is a necessity in a non-federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider doing the same for norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland – remarkably – is the most successful political movement against austerity in europe , and has achieved a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now , only to be able to impose austerity on berlin and brussels .
early puberty : grow faster
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly mean puberty .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for the disease .
experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty , and that it is a source of the early adolescent period .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among young people , especially in young people , who are more likely to be young and old .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned that her daughter is already breast and shamhair at the age of seven or eight years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pedagogic and pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , the pediatric endocrine dr. paul kaplowitz explained this .
“ i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that the puberty is fast coming , ” said kaplowitz .
obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shamboyhair and underhair , as well as body odor , are evident in girls earlier .
however , there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarche ( appearance of the first bleeding ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
“ when breasts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche , ” said kaplowitz , author of the book “ early puberty for girls : the essential advice to deal with this .
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
it is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spill before the age of eight .
in most cases , the process is slowing or stagnating – something a paediatrician can monitor closely .
if progress is made more quickly , tests could be performed by an endikronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumours or cysts .
there are methods of delaying early menstruation and preventing another consequence : premature aging .
the recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reluctant about medicines , but he admits : “ suppressing puberty can cause behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age-comrades . ”
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ they are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygiene side , ” said kaplowitz .
“ it was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter got her ten days .
even if there were some signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she was frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her friends circle .
there are many widely publicized theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are produced in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
boys , like girls , are in the early puberty .
kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the launch of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , which showed a connection between body fat and admission to puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a part .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white contemporaries .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another puzzle : although boys have already used to grow their face and shampoo hair , the trend towards a full-scale former puberty is not as pronounced as girls .
other doctors at the aap conference emphasised the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at goryeb children .
parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child .
“ this may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected ” , said kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .
jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders , in the face of large orders .
a clash has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers over the wide range of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which has set the tone for a bitter clash at dubai airshow this month .
the dispute revolves around the seat width , which passengers can use for long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned about airlines , but this designated passenger space is the key to the success of the airline .
airbus this week demanded an industry standard that has a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch-rival boeing says that this should be the case .
the dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to produce even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft .
as the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it has rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated that will be the new “ mini jumbo ” design .
boeing claims that its modernized “ 777x ” record 406 people with tourist seats that exceed 17 inches wide and thus ten per row allow .
airbus has declared that the competing version of the a350 will carry 350 people in 18 inch wide seated in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants often disagree with technical details through advertising in the press .
now , before the dubai airshow , airbus is appealing , where the 777x will probably start the race with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that is the beginning of a new ad war , and that showed donors a picture in which three people were squashed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would they accept that ? ”
&quot; boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are more narrow than regional turbo-props , &quot; says airbus sales chief john leahy .
in the face of changed eating habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when the boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the average male american rose between 40 and 49 years by ten per cent .
the waist range of the average male american in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the “ jet set ” , which was recently baptized , was smaller .
studies have been carried out , according to airbus , which show that an additional customs duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases the sleeping quality by 53 % .
boeing is denying airbus ’ figures to the seating dimensions and says that it is not at the manufacturers &apos; discretion to decide how airlines can maintain the balance between air fares and equipment .
the company also explains that according to the investigations , the experience on the aircraft is more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they can , in their view , to succeed . ”
you do not want us to dictate to you what makes you profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with more freedom of elbow , but manufacturers will increasingly be faced with a subject that relates to sales .
behind the competition is a race to order aircraft with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export balance .
as reuters first reported in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new jets .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , which has 365 seats .
the statements made by boeing about the results depend in part on the fact that the 777x , with its ten seats per row , is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than the current ten seats per row machines .
&quot; boeing squeezes more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , &quot; kevin keniston says , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that many passengers chose the narrower arrangement , which would be accompanied by cheaper air fares .
&quot; eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the threat of the 777 , &quot; says mary .
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .
the world travelers jet sellers even carry bandwidth to make the equipment measure with the competition .
even if they promote comfort , all manufacturers offer jets with high compressed design .
airbus has a ten-seater a350 , but has not sold it as it claims .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of greater flexibility in the cabins and the need for seats at the corridors that are broad for some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to disappear , but will be overwhelmed by the wave of 777x sales .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could put a stop to smoking pleasure .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can spoil the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .
before testing on humans , further tests are needed , which may take a few years to come , but professor ronald crystal of weill cornell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and who are using all the methods available on the market , but who have had to experience that their niche is more .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then provide a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they break the brain , which results in a smoker not being a nicotine high .
in trials , vaccinated mice administered to nicotine kept their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .
the experiments are published in the journal science translational medicine .
earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they had been antibodies .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the level of antibodies so often that they would be expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is safe , could give birth to children before they are tempted to take a lethal .
but smokers are more likely to use it to stop .
“ you know : if you start smoking again , you will feel a sense of danger because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps you to break the habit ” , he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .
tripodi denied , influenced by obeid , was a member of the tripodi community .
the former labour minister joe tripodi of new south wales is being investigated by the state corruption control .
the former minister for nsw denies that the rules on maritime leasing , at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , have changed the covert involvement in three land on state-controlled land .
the independent commission against corruption ( icao ) is a commission against corruption and has been working on the issue of the issue on friday of whether obeid has received various ministers of state in this direction .
now , because of the accusation that tripodi has a hidden interest in the land from obeid , tripodis has been forced to replace the former deputy chief of staff lynne ashne ascha .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had insisted on public tender for lease contracts .
the peasants were against it and wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies on the circular quay , which gave obeids $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tenders .
tripodi , the port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .
but he declined to make the changes at obeid ’ s request , which , as tripodi confirmed , was aimed at reforming the government ’ s lease arrangements .
one of the icac ’ s telephone records showed conversations between obeid , tripodi , and steve dunn , a senior official who was transferred to the port ministry after he was beaten under obedience .
“ was the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of commercial packaging regulations ? ” , the deputy commissioner anthony whealy tripodi asked .
“ no , ” tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes attack targets in syria , according to official sources , and the military is not a source of military power .
israeli hunting planes would have been a destination in the syrian port of latakia on thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , the goal was russian sa-125 missiles .
at least twice this year , israel has already made air strikes on missile deliveries to syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could undergo “ real estate ” testing .
the government is thinking about a “ test of authenticity ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as as part of enhanced measures .
if the test were to be introduced , it would be applied through a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door to the move of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour mp , maxine mckew , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ vocal explanations such as “ foreigners are to be on the back ” and , australians should hire first , ” are a very unpleasant backdrop in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said australia .
historically , this has been said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echo this historic artefact , they would be able to do so without surprise .
the proposal for a debate outlines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chris bowen .
brendan o &apos;connor , the immigration minister , who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in sri lanka , has proposed five of the proposed changes that will be adopted , and the others will be considered .
if the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , then someone applying for a visa could be reviewed to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the visa is required .
firms may also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after a number of companies that have previously been able to employ only a small number of workers , after all , hundreds .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after he had been sent to the christmas market with a refugee boat this week .
the disrupted nine-year-old son of the man who came to australia with him has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat .
australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study that will demonstrate the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
hs2 ltd is working on the idea of a new project to be launched from phase 1 in 2026 , with high-speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
minister for transport baroness kramer said that the project will bring britain closer together .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between london and the west midlands .
after phase 2 finishes there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between london and northern england from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has instructed hs2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for nordenand and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are making progress with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
but it is also about the connection between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state alistair carmichael commented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for the scottish involvement in the hs2 network to be “ unmistakably ” .
brown said : “ the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , but at the same time , scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will benefit everyone and will make the glasgow-edinburgh connection complementary to the scottish government .
i look forward to discussing the report with the british ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian air passengers must continue to use tablets and smartphones on startup and landing , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules on such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) allows us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can be checked during critical flight phases during e-books , videos can see or play , if they are in the “ air traffic ” mode .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they have to leave their e-books on the start and landing .
australian societies are watching the decision that us airlines have to do a huge amount of work to implement , but are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air traffic control agency casa also said that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in australia are still valid .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” was announced .
the subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines can maintain safety at all times and passengers can use the safety instructions given by cabin crew .
virgin has already started to talk about extending its wi-fi entertainment system to include flights with casa and explains that it is open to changes , that they need to be initiated by the legislator .
“ we would like to see casa reviewing the authorisation of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight . ”
qantas said that they would remain with current regulations for the time being .
“ our current policy is that electronic devices will not be used at the start and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” said the company .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will be very interested in the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a different impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft tolerate the radio disturbances caused by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer instruction .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can make it easier for passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height ” , said .
in rare cases , the crew will instruct passengers to take the necessary equipment to the landing stage .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when they were started and landed .
before the schalke district by , there were also some of the bvb trailers with light missiles for ugly scenes in the veltins arena .
borussia dortmund announced tough consequences .
before friday &apos;s match of the bundesliga football league against the vfb stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence - first .
it was an unfamiliar , almost ghostly acoustics that could be felt to the viewer just before the beginning of the bundesliga game between german vice champion borussia dortmund and dem vvd .
the audience was mostly listening to the guest fans with their songs .
the south grandstands , by contrast , where the most loyal - and loudest - bvb fans , initially presented themselves in an exceptionally quiet way : no songs , no calls for slaughter .
the podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinated the joint launch , remained unfilled .
and , at the front of the gallery , a great flag , with the title &quot; section stadium ban &quot; , stood alone .
only as goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always was the first bvb player to enter the course , was a short-term jubilation .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vocal vocals and wearing scarves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstands , nothing was stirred up .
the fact that stadium speakers norbert dickel have once again reviewed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , extension of trainer jürgen klopp - did not cause festivals .
only five minutes before the first hit , the capo knocked his podium - and which until then had been almost with hands tangible tension .
finally , as always , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally , the loudest place in the stadium was again as usual .
and at the latest when the south grandstand has heard the loudly call for &apos; derby winners stand on &apos; , everything was again as usual .
silence before that was probably a response to what has happened over the past few days .
just before revierderby at the fc schalke 04 some of the co-travelers had launched light missiles into the audience ranks and fired onto the square - almost torn down .
the game was delayed due to chaotic scenes .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the top of the dortmund ultras in his office - and he believes watzke &apos;s words , this was more improbable for the fan appointment .
&quot; it will require massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , &quot; the bvb boss announced on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , watzke forbidden ultras from playing a choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i have banned this , &quot; he explained .
the policy of zero tolerance in the field of pyrotechnics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - they now have time to decide on a punishment by tuesday .
otherwise , watzke says , the bvb will be imposing a sanction by the end of next week .
&quot; that will be very significant &quot; , said watzke .
we can be curious to see how the reactions in the southern gallery will turn out .
pfandhouses are booming in singapore , as the crisis has reached the middle class , and the crisis has reached its middle-class level .
in a pfandhaus in the bendemeer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga is exchanging a golden arm , a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says amirthalinga .
although they spend 3,000 singapore dollars ( about 1,730 euros ) each month as an administrative employee and their husband also work , the monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that valuemax , where it is exchanged , is now the third deposit .
pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uncomfortable bank .
typically , pfandhouses in singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % that the united overseas bank requires , a local lender with a fixed rate of 1 % .
however , pfandhouses have the advantage that they do not require any verification of creditworthiness or income certificates , which makes loans faster than banks can .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to pfandhouses after families have been exposed to the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income homes seek refuge , thus avoiding a stifling economy .
this week , the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s described the growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mortgages , as a risk factor in the creditworthiness of asian banks .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore have , according to the agency , the highest budget debt in asia relative to gross domestic product .
malaysia is the top of the list , accounting for 80 % of gdp , a 60 % increase in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed that there was still a lack of exports and a fall in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle-to-lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says song seng .
historic gold price peaks over the past two years have shown the trend towards personal pledges , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the family ’ s jewellery into cash .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the items pledged are sold in the 200 pfandhouses of the city state gold .
people say , “ the price of gold looks good , let us plow grandmothers ’ gold chain and return next month . ”
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has a 20 % customer growth in its branches in recent months .
growth in the deposit business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the branch in bendemeer and 15 more in singapore , not only exported to neighbouring malaysia – where the company is expanding .
the company finances this with 60 percent of the 66 million singapore dollars it has this week with the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders are caught in a crossfire because of high interest rates , yeah says that pfandhouses not only offer more favorable interest rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise the debt .
“ customers borrow items they already own , and the liquefied personal valuables do not increase household indebtedness , ” explains them .
the mortgage lending business is increasingly seen as short-term , secured financing in society .
nor are all people who use mortgage loans in financial difficulties .
rich people from singapore also come to the branches of valuemax to build gold bars and rolex watches , for which they have been responsible up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .
we have clients from all social classes .
“ this includes wealthy people who have a short-term interest in a business or investment , or small businesses that are facing cash flow bottlenecks , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .

rescue package of $ 325 million in australia for tasman health care
the australian government insists on the tough conditions that have been met by the rescue package of over $ 325 million in australia for tasman health to ensure that the us government is fully respected .
federal minister of health tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota .
the funding for a four-year period was agreed after government consultations with the independent tasman member andrew wilkie .
“ the government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the federal state to address . ”
the $ 325 million package of dollars entails 31 million in emergency aid for election services .
with a further 2600 operations , including orthopedic surgery and treatment for grey star , residues are to be eliminated .
there is also money for dayclinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare after stationary stays , which provide specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of an electronic recording system .
“ these investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinic staff told me they were the best way to improve the tasman healthcare system , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability for tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the commonwealth , and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent .
a three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that would put the tasman public health system on a more sustainable course . ”
nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent help , which he first addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” wilkie said .
according to the state government , these election benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s public health spokesman , peter dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ patchwork solution . ”
“ we are in the current situation because the laboratory state government has received $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to abc tv .
it is not acceptable for a government to spend nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and the commonwealth to put in 300 million and then pretend that the good news is good .
dutton called upon plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot convinces with its exceptional production equipment and contemporary details , but it is also more expensive to eat than is necessary .
the action played in france in the 1760s tells the story of suzanne , a young nobleman who had been brought to the monastery by her family .
when she rebelled , she was extremely cruel to a very sadistic colonel and became the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slides into limelight or sensationalist lust – and that is where the problem lies .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a painful bust for the public .
syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group , and the un security council has called for a ban on the use of nuclear weapons .
syria has important facilities for producing chemical weapons and gitfgasmunitions , the global chemical monitoring group declared on thursday , while it is operating in the north of the country in severe clashes near one of the sites of the islamic republic .
on thursday , too , a syrian group of activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came on the agenda one day before the date of the day before the date of the meeting on 1 january 2000 .
1 november , which the hague based organization damascus had set to use all facilities for producing chemical weapons , or “ inoperative ” them .
the conclusion of this process , which is in fact the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons in syria by mid-2014 .
the destruction of facilities means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , must start to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .
according to estimates , there are around 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when on thursday , fights took place in the city of safira , experts say that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities here , as the british residents have .
the activist group , which , through a network of activists in syria , has seen the number of deaths , declared on thursday that 120,296 people had died .
61,067 of them were civilians , including 6,365 children .
the government had 29.9,954 of them in the army of president bashar assad , 18,678 being pro-government fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
the dead also included 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has led some two million people to flee the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in safira for weeks , many of which have links with al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that there was a loss on thursday on both sides , but did not mention details .
the fights underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war .
according to the opcw , which works closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will have all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and has witnessed their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”
earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of the checks and that 21 out of 23 of the sites identified by damascus had visited .
because of security concerns , two institutions were unable to visit , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc said that the two sites had been “ abandoned ... ” according to syrian statements , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were transferred to other aforementioned facilities that were inspected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two facilities that the opc inspectors could not visit .
syria has drawn up a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved by the executive committee of the opwc next month .
“ i prefer the hat to the bravery and courage that they all have in meeting the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mostly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting assad ’ s government and security forces , which have been a large number of alawites ’ members , in the civil war .
in view of further developments , rami abdurrahman , the head of the monitoring group , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .
anger at bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bali bombing reacted with anger at the ruling of the last of the instigators who had been tried .
patek , who has been one of the most sought after people in south-east asia for nearly ten years , was awarded the prize yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing .
he could be released after 15 years with a suspension .
the 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 australians .
a conviction was also found in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive charges .
the prosecutor had demanded a life sentence , even if it was a punishment for the man who was killed because of his reputation as a master bomb builder , as well as a “ demolition man ” .
the decision has painful memories at june corteen , a mother from perth who lived her 39 years old twin brothers jane and jenny in the patek and his fellow conspirators .
fighting with tears , she said that patek should have been sentenced to death .
i really do think that he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; one should put him before a shooting command , &quot; corteen said to aap .
i have to live every day with no other grandchildren and i never will see my daughters .
the sari club was equated to the ground when a violent attack on 12 october 2002 took place shortly after 23 : 00 in a small basin that was parked in front of the nightclub .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where a suicide bomber was killed just 20 seconds earlier , a rug filled with explosives .
he fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times while working on a life retention system .
hughes said that patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra were responsible for the blood .
indeed , this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds , is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers to be tried .
he escaped arrest for almost a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces attacked the former al-qaeda chief osamba .
during the negotiation , an fbi agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that the pamphlet in pakistan was not enough to bin laden to meet the target of strengthening the link between south-east asian terrorist groups .
“ he has not stood up , ” said corteen .
until recently , he has shown no repentance at how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , which marked the beginning of commemorative ceremonies in bali and australia .
“ there will be many tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek may appeal against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not make mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now change their electronic equipment from departure to landing for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching films , but not with the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by aviation from thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , faa &apos;s employee michael huerta explained at a press conference .
airlines must prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations for stowing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the faa has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to limit the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the faa announced in a statement .
at the moment , passengers have to turn off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not restart it until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .
when you arrive at the airport , passengers have to turn them off again and they are not allowed to restart before the plane has landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safe against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , landing and on the wheelfield , the faa declared .
most new aircraft and other aircraft used for wi fi in larger heights .
laura glading , president of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regime is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit , ” glading commented .
we are frankly sorry to feel more receptive to this issue .
however , internet connections to surf , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained banned , explained the authority .
passengers are invited to purchase smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so still not a “ words with friends ” that resembles scrabble online game , which the actor alec baldwin 2011 will play on his smartphone when he is publicity jet .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stolen , as there is a danger of injury if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight remain banned .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not the faa .
faa may lift the ban on certain electronic devices on startup and landing on certain types of electronic equipment at landing and landing on the aircraft .
last month , mark rosenker of the national transportation safety board , safety expert for national transport issues , said on cbs news , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .
“ cell phone really is a problem , not only because they could potentially cause interference in navigation devices , but because we know from the fcc that the transmission from the air also disturbs transmitter masts ” , so .
a consulting committee of the industry , led by the faa to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the industry government set up a broader set of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure has increased on the faa to ease restrictions on use .
critics such as senator claire mccaskill of missouri , a democratic senator , argue that there is no valid reason for banning it .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies have said that up to a third of passengers will not be able to switch off or ignore the device .
the faa began in 1966 , restricting the use of electronic equipment by air passengers , after reports of interference in navigation and communication equipment by passengers &apos; ucv radios had been published , which were then published .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built in such a way that the faa allows them to have no electronic interference .
airlines have been offering passengers wi-fi for several years now , when the flight level is reached .
the flies adapted to wi-fi systems are also more insensitive to interference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new guidelines , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you turn the page .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
those who advocate easing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers are amazon.com.
in 2011 , the company ’ s employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detect them .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .
douglas kidd from the national association of airline passengers said he was of the opinion that the disruption caused by the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who are responsible for disrupting aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee , however , recommended that the faa allow pilots to take the lead in instrument landing under bad visibility conditions .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are today fully equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea drilling island rescued birds to be released again .
a water rescue service to the coast , which is depleted on a north sea boreline , has been found .
the water purse was dispatched last month with a helicopter to aberdeen , where it was used by the scottish animal welfare organisation spca in their rescue centre in alloa .
colin seddon , head of the center , said : “ this water ral was probably a winter draught bird from northern europe , which was blown up by the strong winds over the north sea . ”
apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the boring island .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we could be contacted with the request for help . ”
when they were released , the water purse was fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who are responsible for wealth and work in britain will be changing in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders , asking them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
yougov interviewed more than 1,000 business executives , roughly the uk ’ s size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow , while the states in the eu are stagnating .
they want new trade links from the government side with countries like china , india , and brazil to be favored , rather than bothering with the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be controlled by westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , as companies said that the cost of the brussels rules would now outweigh the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies traditionally agreed to it .
finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority had taken a course of change in the agreement by the united kingdom and that a relationship with the eu based on trade is not based on politics .
this recognition , which is shared by companies of all sizes and companies of all sizes , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaningful change ” , which will bring the stitching of action back to britain .
it is a matter of a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies will see a marked shift in power relations back to the united kingdom from a renegotiation .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , now that the eurozone is moving toward closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , which means that companies must pay more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulations .
alexei miller of gazprom calls the pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipeline in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , as stated by the gazprom board .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said gazprom ’ s ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is said to be more diverse in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a dispute between gazprom and his counterparts in ukraine , where most of russia &apos;s gas is stored for europe , is a concern for increased risk of conventional gas pipelines , such as those of official authorities .
miller said the direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the links with transit countries to geopolitical risks are “ forever ” .
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream at a reduced rate if the entire project is operational in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is limited to an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca employees warned of accusations against jonathan lord for sexual offences .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) have been arrested for sexual offences related to children before being accused of offences against the carer jonathan lord in 2011 .
however , in the opening statement to the commission , the ymca said that ‘ you never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ .
managing director phillip hare was asked about a case in which a ymca employee was convicted of child pornography offences and another , in which a sports teacher was the ymca .
hare said gail furness , a lawyer assisting the commission , knew about the first case , but not the second .
he admitted that he had already made the opening declaration of the ymca to the commission in the statement that ‘ there have been external checks of the ymca , in which the ymca was considered to be the front line .
evidence to the commission shows that the ymca has been informed that it is the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education .
hare , who started with 21 at the ymca , admitted that the management had “ downwards from me ” in the recruitment of lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations .
lord was convicted of sexual offences at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the ymca at the beginning of the year .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare stritt absolved that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting murder violations in respect of the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including that lord had been alone with children , was a baby boy in private .
danielle ockwell , whose chief lord was and who was asked to take a child protection training course because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the child service providers were not able to attend the training .
the managing director said he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors .
instead , he said , their friendship with lord has affected their judgement , which is why they did not report it .
he explained that he had given the board of the ymca nsw his view that the lesson that the organization had learned from the “ jonathan lord incident ” was not a simple one .
hare said that the decision to brief employees for signing confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations was made was taken by the director of the children &apos;s services of the ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent the evidence from being contaminated , but this is ‘ overzealous ’ and badly implemented .
the ymca nsw was born in the time when jonathan lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , and was not a safe organisation for children , professor stephen smallbone of griffith university explained .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in recruiting , reviewing , processing , training , and supervising staff .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as british prime minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his exit from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since its resignation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , blair has largely avoided speaking out about british policy , and his comments have mostly been directed at foreign policy and its role as envoy of the quartet .
in answer to the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , blair was quoted by the london evening standard as saying , ‘ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen ... ’
when the horse show experts in droves found their way into cardiff to shorten the horse of the year , they realised that a fierce competition was imminent .
but no one was able to prepare for the three-year-old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago , did its first steps , and its shetland pony toffee ran through the first three rounds and won the first 30 rounds .
the inseparable pair , both equal in size , were not removed due to their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition , which was erected by the sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry near cardiff .
he was a member of the royal society of the united states of america , and was a member of the united states of america .
fenton was chosen by the jury for his natural skills in handling the pony , which lasts well above his age .
and toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality .
fenton had toffee last march as a gift for his third birthday and since then have been bargaining with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great span . ”
they had to compete against the entire field and are equipped with gold cup and rosette .
it was only the second time that he participated in a competition with toffee and we were all excited when he won .
he was considered by the most strangers in the arena to be so phenomenal that he wanted to be photographed with him .

he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about .
as it is started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure he will do well .
one speaker of the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to handle his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury judged fenton and toffee how well they beaten themselves and presented them in the demonstration ring .
they look for good cooperation between pony and leaders – and here fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that fenton &apos;s sweetness has played its part in making this a perfect occasion .
after calling it “ reformed ” , china ’ s newspaper is said to be “ reformed ”
a chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a reporter charged with defamation , should be reformed .
the guangzhou new express had a rare public call to release the guangzhou journalist chen yongzhou .
but chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to report a sub-state company .
now the new express will be subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulator declared .
the “ rectification order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in guangdong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new express , which leads to the yangcheng evening news group , will be available between september 2012 and august 2013 for several inaccurate reports on the listed company .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disorganised , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that they decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on chen yongzhou and to grant him his reporter ’ s license . ”
in addition , “ the yangcheng evening news group has been instructed to provide a complete rectification of the new express and to recommend that the relevant persons responsible for the new express be identified and immediately contact the new express management team . ”
chen had written several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalists to write a letter of formal notice .
but then chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .
“ in this case , i have damaged zoomlion , as have the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he declared to the state news station cctv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and glory .
i realise that i have acted wrongly .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express published an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television .
experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves .
drug tunnel with its own railway network between the usa and mexico
one of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered by lighting , ventilation and electric rail operation , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the tunnels measuring 120 times 90 centimetres as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .
the tunnel , which is in the zigzag pattern , stretching nearly six football fields , connects warehouses near tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unimaginable storage halls in the area , which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported undetected in it , the authorities declared .
eight inches were taken into account when the tunnel was discovered and 148 kilograms of cocaine were obtained , according to the records of the court .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were convicted of having ownership and selling marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with prison sentences of ten years or so .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which challenges the drug cartels to quickly bring their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities found a passage of less than 640 meters long with rails , which could be used from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two warehouses in san diego .

according to the lexicon , veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism , but it is quite different from it .
because while vegetarians are prepared to eat cream , ice or a strong edam , they are not prepared to eat any of the tasty meals .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the absence of meat and fish , the vegan leaves all animal products to be consumed - even honey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection , the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; bread spreads are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the local reformist house , who has produced a variety of special products for vegans .
reuben proctor also visits the shop in the cathedral street .
for 13 years , vegan , born in new zealand , has been living in lampertheim ( almost ) all he needs for life . &quot; in 1997 , i changed my diet and became a vegetarian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; but the conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proctor , who prefers artificial leather normal leather .
he realized that there are also other everyday concerns without animal products .
vegan is primarily an ethics .
&quot; i don &apos;t want animals to die for me , &quot; proctor speaks out the maxim of vegans , which covers all consumption behavior .
instead of burgers , agitators or rubber bears , vegan vegan quickly got new products , which were inspired by the enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proctor today , &quot; in fact , vegan is not a waiver , an ascendance , but rather an enrichment &quot; .
and it was these conditions that led some people , even though they were meant to do so , to fail .
&quot; addiction is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proctor makes a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain tastes are not to be seized on the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains vegans .
for example , proctor brings eggplant , mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue .
it is a balanced , varied diet , with a good taste for it .
of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food &quot; , says proctor .
health problems , including eating disorders , another widespread assumption , did not suffer .
for me , the conversion had a positive aspect .
i do not take up any foreign cholesterol and i have an increased vitamin content .
there are high-performance buildings exclusively dedicated to vegan nutrition .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check &quot; , says proctor .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 is a warning to many vegan simusts .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , rather than grass on the pasture , it is doubtful whether in the meat that you buy in the chest , the vitamin b12 percentage is high .
vegans also have the option of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proctor must not go far in the way of food procurement .
after all , basic foodstuffs are everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
i find everything i need on the ground .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products are known to be &quot; .
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen of the house there is much to discover , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , proctor was able to astonish his faithful parents .
family celebrations give the vegan a new spice .
this has dynamism when you cook together , it has a new meaning .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
but , of course , he has already been sceptical .
do you not like my food anymore ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - in such cases , one should ask as a vegan with a fingertip .
&quot; i don &apos;t reject people , i &apos;m part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to set an enclave .
and , more precisely , everyday life doesn ’ t seem as vegan as suspected - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also allowed .
pommes are everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria , it is different from pasta dishes , or it is just a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slowly setting themselves up for it .
&quot; when i started to eat vegan 13 years ago , things were much more difficult &quot; , the new zealand can find a development : &quot; you have to deal with people , you have to draw them to it &quot; .
&quot; if there are enough requests , they may be tempted to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
vegan restaurants develop , such as the mannheim comb or the café vogelfrei .
proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan dishes are there for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; says proctor .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way of preventing most of the things from being done in advance , &quot; says proctor .
however , purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .
especially when one learns to understand that animal additives are also used in peanuts as colourants , one seems to be satisfied with the ethics of so many hurdles and traps quickly .
not only for this reason , reuben proctor and lars thomsen have written a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients , the food and also the cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually you develop a scanner view and know what characters and logos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble &quot; , proctor knows .
veganism , it is an important moral finger , which points to consciousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to dismiss his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits .
the exchange operator nasdaq omx keeps its customers in breath .
the nasdaq options market was launched on friday afternoon of german time .
in a communication the operator caused technical problems .
the other 11 us options markets , including two of the nasdaq omx , continued their business unhindered .
the recent incident has resulted in a whole series of small and large gaps in the stock market operator .
only on tuesday , the indices of nasdaq were a one-hour loss due to errors in data transport .
in august of this year alone , there were two gaps in a week .
first , us investment bank goldman sachs had placed massive faulty procurement contracts to options markets because of technical problems .
in response , stock exchange operators took almost a day to look through and cancel orders .
two days later , half of the total share trade in the us was due to a computer breakdown on the nasdaq stock exchange for several hours .
the stock market opening of facebook also caused a lot of alarm last year .
the nasdaq systems were the flood of purchase and sales orders not grown , later they set up the stock exchange supervision sec and donated the money to the company .
konstanz : cyclists from 63 years old

british police are making assange a delivery decision to the united kingdom .
the british police have today sent a request for extradition to wikileaks founder julian assange , who is in the ecuadorian embassy in london seeking refuge and applying for asylum .
scotland yard said that it was given a “ call to join the 40-year-old australian , ” which led him to appear in a police station , and added that he should be unable to do so .
assange is threatened with extradition to sweden for charges of sexual offence after his possibilities for british law have been exhausted .
as he fears that stockholm will hand him over to the united states , he had a very strong case in the ecuadorian embassy in london on 19 june and asked the south american country for political asylum .
scotland yard was “ a 40-year-old man who was asked to sign up to a police station at a time we chose , ” one speaker said .
he continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .
assange fears that he will be extradited from sweden to the united states and will be prosecuted there for possible spying charges , after having received over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosure website wikileaks .
drivers who arrive at the airport with 210 km / h and a hot drink will receive £ 1,000 .
a driver was fined £ 1,000 because he was driving with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his boys .
andrew howie , 35 , from tiptree , essex , was born on may 27 with his mercedes benz on the a120 near braintree .
after the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cube between his legs .
in the colchester court , howie owed himself to be guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention .
he received seven points and a six-month driving ban .
howie was also invited to pay £ 90 and a surcharge of £ 100 .
tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s bubble
the treasury has provisionally calculated the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of chancellor george osborne , who was in the 2012 budget to set a stamp tax of $ 1.50 billion .
already now , revenue from the stamp tax on housing in westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea districts is already exceeding the tax revenue of 708 million pounds in 2012 / 13 .
cook said : “ after the stempel tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation , it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are too low to be taxed , regardless of the impact of the general tax .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more restrained about buying real estate in london , or discouraged owners , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – is located in the wealthy south-west belt of london , which stretches from fulham to wimbledon .
central london &apos;s prices showed a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were driven by an emerging “ domestic market ” .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog &apos;s tail swings are related to its mood .
previous research has shown that happy dogs with the tail weed more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while there are nervous dogs on the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs perceive these subtle differences and can respond to them .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the university of trento , said : “ in man , it is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that provoke positive or negative . ”
we tried to look at this from other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have a right brain half for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres have different roles in the emotions .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side tow of their species , the researchers supervised the animals while the animals were watching other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-legged pets and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the cock is getting into one direction , sometimes in the other .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have shown dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to be able to show distracting other aspects , and we were able to do so .
if the animals saw an otherwise unprintable dog pushing the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the sweeping dog ) , they were left completely relaxed .
but was the propensity to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that wears ) , their heart rate rose and they saw annoying .
professor vallortigara says that dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience , in which movements they should worry about and when not .
he said : “ if you have different encounters with other dogs and waving with the tail in one direction is more connected to friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior , you respond on the basis of these experiences .
researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and coaches help to better understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , an expert in dog behavior and guest scholarship at the faculty of animal medicine at the university of bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether links were left .
last year , a team from lincoln university found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch an aggressive dog , and right if they were a satisfied dog .
in another research at the university of victoria in canada , the following was stated : “ dogs tend to go to a robot dog if his tail is wearing links and not right , rather than be annoying .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore arouse that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robot dogs did not interpret as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for various purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said bradshadow.
however , since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes turns into one , sometimes in the other direction .

pope francis appoints the first cardinals in february .
pope francis will be presenting new cardinals of the catholic church on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also the ones who choose a pope , so that francis is thus the first group of men .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope election – that is to say a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals ” .
in a statement announcing the news , father federico lombardi , a speaker of the vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held .
“ pope francis decided to reconsider his decision to convene the february history of consensus in advance , so that others who want to avoid kardinaelic participation from around the world can be planned . ”
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of eligible cardinals is likely to fall by february .
he said that a pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary to reduce the number of eligible cardinals to 120 , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he would like .
next year &apos;s consistency is significant because it is the first since the election of francis in march of this year , according to valero .
there is currently a certain overhang on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the new pope cardinals from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance , ” he said .
forty percent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to be used since the formation of the kardinäle council , founded by francis , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the order .
in the past , the pope decided everything on its own .
&quot; now francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , &quot; said valero .
he said that it was “ possible ” that francis had to ask the cardinals for advice .
but , all things considered , we have not been able to do so .
valero said that typically the bishops from large places are called cardinals , but they are stuck in franziskus “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”
gm is launching new pickup trucks in the usa for repair the seat backrest .
general motors calls just under 19,000 of its brand new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest .
some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal regulations for the safety of the vehicle in the case of head restraints .
“ when driving from behind to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was mentioned in the news on the national highway website .
the recalled models were produced between 1 august and 10 september .
the delivery of gm trucks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading us car manufacturer since the bankruptcy restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of october .
the nhtsa was able to close the notification of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in october .
the sale of silverado and sierra trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model , took place by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , gm declared on friday .
in october , gm 42.660 sold silverado and 16,503 sierra pickup trucks .
gm shares increased by 1.4 percent to 37.47 us dollars on the new york stock exchange on friday afternoon .
obama ’ s cry of desperation
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .
he says that obama has made commendable efforts to break down the republicans ’ blockade tactics .
the blocking policy does not excuse the obamacare website problems , the drone attacks and the threat of violence against women .
obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .
nathaniel p. morris is a student at the harvard medical school for the second year .
i am reading a terribly sad book at the moment .
it is a book i thought would be a book that would make me feel at home during the bleak second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .
it is called “ the audacity to win ” and describes the memoirs barack obama ’ s presidential election .
when i finish the evening with my patient records and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave the breath of a speech .
the election was a landslide victory , and news spokesmen held to defend the historic significance of this hour .
my classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on their way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama joined office in 2008 , he had agreed 82 % .
and then i close the book .
switching back to the present is a bad awakening , as if you were being torn out of a dream .
it is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , something has actually changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the archbishop &apos;s life .
i agree that the party political blockade too many attempts are being made to break down our nation &apos;s path .
but , having repeatedly criticised the obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances , i have come to the end of my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political despair .
republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to allow foreign leaders to intercept or to stop killing innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has collected data on american privacy and why whistleblower is punished , the state &apos;s misconduct is revealed .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , a us citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were being exceeded during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the &apos; most aggressive ... since the nixon government &apos; .
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make a living in more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether that is what i should have expected .
i should have understood , at 18 , that the work of government could have contradicted the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the newtown massacre shape public debate .
but if i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bothers me most .
i re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , he seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with obama ’ s approval rating falling to below 45 % this week , this book has made it all the harder to return to 2008 .
it awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have disappeared into air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama could make a heavy loss against clinton in pennsylvania ’ s pre-election polls .
in a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , i could not agree more with you .
the views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has had a conflict of interests during parental leave
mr palmer , the billionaire and mr abbott , says that prime minister abbott is in conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnat , who was in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , claimed that when he asked questions about it he would be thrown away .
the palmer united party could control up to four votes in the senate , which are important in deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holiday , ” said palmer .
two months after the election , the electoral commission , with 53 votes , declared palmer to be the official winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it could proceed more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections were to be decided two months after the vote was ended ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why not have a system where you go in , send the data into a computer , choose and then click 6 : 30 .
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
if you use them , because you can erase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
to vote with pencils today is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , declared that his policy was to have an international airport for the sunshine coast and that he had to “ take his new office very seriously . ”
a public office is about serving the public .
“ we are not seeking reward except for history , namely that we serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two currency traders
the royal bank of scotland has two traders from its forex department suspended , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the bank of scotland ’ s global authorities are being investigated as the alleged measures .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank and rbs , confirmed that they had cooperated with the authorities in the investigation of the world ’ s largest financial market , which is changing 5.3 trillion dollars a day .
the two retailers would be the first rbs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that has been followed by the scandal surrounding the libor interbanking business .
the bank , which does not comment on the suspension , confirmed this month that it will receive information requests from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are fully cooperating with the fca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation indicated that rbs had not yet received the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the british supervisory authority , the financial conduit .
this trader , richard usher , had left the rbs 2010 and is now expected to leave his current position as european leader of the forex spot trade at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of european spot trading at citi , was vacated this week and matt gardiner , formerly the chief currency trader at barclays and ubs , was named this week at standard .
none of these dealers has been accused of any misconduct .
to the instant message group of usher , bankers at barclays and the citigroup said to the people close to the situation .
ubs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority finma declared that they had committed alleged manipulation of the currency market in a number of swiss banks investigated .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently dealing with allegations that the government is not doing so .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar persons .
banks pass instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has left traders in a sector that has been at the forefront of the economy in recent years , becoming one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks , but this year under pressure from low volatility because of low prices .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to avoid the vast and highly liquid currency market .
a leading trader noticed that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms has led to this by banks .
the news came out the same day when credit suisse announced that she had sent a retailer of her london exchange traded funds office this week after he had received a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said credit suisse .
the construction fence on the bechle plot paints the building fence on the plot .
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss meadow &quot; has installed the fence on the bechle plot on the spa promenade in bad herrenalb .
it also cleaned and widened the footpath , it says in a press release .
the planned cover of the decommissioning house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened to slide .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had launched the beautification action with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action was a transparent with the message &apos; we have been in favour &apos; .
this disturbed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their actions .
her motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against ruins &quot; .
in this way , it was prepared to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the swiss meadow - if the giant project one day fails .
in conversation with many passers-by in front of the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the bi presented .
but they begin to resignate because the city is further delaying these responses , it is said by the bi .
as we heard , the public statements by the mayor have also had an impact .
may said at the local council meeting that he would not be afraid of this for the thermal bath , if the population were to vote against plans for bathing and wellness facilities on the swiss meadow .
some people seem , therefore , frightened , others feel they are &quot; crude attempts at blackmail &quot; of the population , says the bi press release .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .
rangnick schelte for schiris : mane is not a swallow king
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high form of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg is , so the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; was disappointed by the referee judges .
&quot; there is a dangerous tendency at the moment for mane and alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings &quot; , he took the two offensivwirblers in protection on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
recent reason for rangnick ’ s criticism was yellow for mane at the 3-0 against grödig last sunday , in which the senegalese had a supposed actress become a fatal act - which , however , was no .
&quot; a stark misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harkam called &quot; totally overstretched &quot; .
harkam would have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between the salzburg-coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
he defended his german compatriot decisively : &quot; i would have behaved in the same way in every situation as roger schmidt &quot; .
schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarlet .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was offended , &quot; emphasized the 46-year-old .
in view of the success , rangnick agreed to a praise .
&quot; there are only two words : right , &quot; he said .
there is not much to say .
the way the team plays is particularly impressive .
let us keep it that way .
cadre changes in winter transfer time will hardly occur .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except for a player , he asks to leave the club &quot; , rangnick made it clear .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health law
it is a big victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court today decided that the barack obama administration ’ s health-care act , closely linked to barack obama , is constitutional .
by five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act – it forces us citizens to reach a health insurance policy by 2014 or pay a penalty .
john roberts , chief judge , sidelined the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the judges scalia , thomas , alito , and kennedy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law and also stated that the target of health law to be applied by states to either terminate or terminate access conditions for medicaid .
the case against the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was enacted by all the leading republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger mitt romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .
norway : norwegian town is lit with giant mirrors light .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .
due to the low degree of sunlight , the water in the vestfjord valley is usually falling in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three giant reflectors at 45 metres high , a century room was realized on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , mayor steinar bergland swore at the start ceremony in the transmitter tv2 .
some talented people got sunchairs right , others set sunglasses for safety .
so far , sun-hungry people had to go on a cable car to a nearby summit in winter .
ten years ago , local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors .
but this idea has existed in the place since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million kroner ( about 615 000 euros ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been giving the italian alpine village viganella winter sunshine for several years .
post hardly leaves on sundays
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for sunday letting are still at various letter boxes of the city centre and the districts that are located , but you can read the small print at the yellow pages .
a request from the fdp confirmed this .
on sundays and public holidays , only a few minutes before the post office building in ernst-ludwig-strasse 36 and in jakob-müller-strasse 1 in hüttenfeld are emptied .
whether in hofheim or rosengarten you are emptied on sunday , the fdp ’ s answer will not be answered .
the german social and youth policy spokesman of the fdp , fritz roehrenbeck , wants to make a retrospective effort here .
sunday clearing is an important postal service .
&quot; this is the only way to make this venture more radical , despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 . &quot;
thomas bittner , group chairman and city chairman of the liberal group , supports his group colleagues : &apos; what annoys me is the fact that klammsteinberg has changed or even deleted the letting times &apos; .
the post office is a long way from being close to the citizens .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the neuschlosse and rose garden must be emptied again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and roehrenbeck unisono .
the city is also considered to be the city centre , and especially not mobile citizens , should be able to reach a mailbox with sunday letting on foot .
roehrenbeck asked the city council whether the city council plans to talk to the post about this matter .
mayor erich maier replied that the post office did not communicate with lampertheim .
however , as far as he knows , there is also a sunday leerung in hofheim .
your party has advocated privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said maier .
frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
the city &apos;s magistrate is discussing a proposal from the concierge stefan majer ( green ) this morning .
the aim is to increase parking fees by 50 percent .
but that is not about raising prices , but about increasing the time interval of car timetables and car park ticket machines from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .
in december , the municipal council of directors will have to decide .
the retailer committee of the frankfurt chamber of commerce considers this &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
the transport club germany believes that an increase after two decades is &apos; quite appropriate and actually long overdue &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
freudenstadt : fast action will overwhelm hosts and the public .
with a narrow cadre , the tsv freudenstadt lords had to leave the schiller schulturnhalle in reutlingen against the tg göningen from the swabian alb .
the elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team .
soon , however , it became apparent that they were also able to cope with the rapid actions of freudenstadt .
with the hard and placed surcharges , the goninger made themselves extremely difficult .
they repeatedly missed out on the new training programmes , which were developed by simon schenk and eduard schulz , and were involved in blockresistance .
two high first prizes clearly demonstrated the superiority of freudenstadt in all aspects .
given this crushing and playful performance , the third set was then somewhat lax and amusing to the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on november 2nd the tv baiersbronn , which was clearly established in nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulz .
in the b-class , the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn had the second teams from baiersbronn and freudenstadt .
they delivered a highly competitive two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points in the ball &apos;s acceptance , and the passports were also very precise .
in this well-balanced encounter , the tv team of marcus blasutto voted for the big physical effort and a very pleasant atmosphere .
day of care at the small engländer hut
the fifth day of the nursing in the follow-up of the natura 2000 project oberer hotzenwald was attended by a group of dedicated participants at the small engländerhütte in ibach .
the public &apos;s suggestions should make it possible to look into the valley at the hut this day , and mayor helmut kaiser said .
many hikers , according to kaiser , described this area as the glittering part of the gorge steep , where the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable instrument for ensuring the connection between man and nature .
it gives every citizen the opportunity to set his own accents in nature .
the ecological consideration can also be taken into account with the tourist aspect .
friederike tribukait from the department of the national protection of the county presidency of freiburg , after the country council &apos;s welcome to tilman bollacher , who took over the patronage , explained this ecological aspect .
the tourist goal of the foresight is , according to tribukait , to make the old ommendweidfeld field , now strongly growing , with its specific protected habitat types , by opening and connecting it to the existing ones .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass breeders , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .
they need these free connections to conservation .
tribukait said that she did not want to miss a lance at this point for the planned biosphere area .
the current measure not only seamlessly integrates into this planning .
a biosphere region also offers the opportunity to create sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous development of the world heritage list .
after these various versions , the revierhead christoph wehle and life project manager cornelia bischoff divided the helpers into groups .
the larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forest trawler may be available .
a group of helpers should be concerned about the exemption of juniper bushes and about the maintenance of a drystone ridge .
the aim was to have a free view at the viewpoint .
löffingen : head of the army is still the only candidate who is still a candidate .

the application deadline expires on monday , november 11th , at 6 pm .
google , samsung , huawei sued for nortel patents
the group that holds thousands of previous nortel patents made an avalanche of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that is involved in the insolvency proceedings .
rockstar , the consortium that holds nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued samsung electronics for its commitment to the market .
rockstar is owned by apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents relate to technology that combines search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , so the complaint that this puts at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc are mobile phones that are android , the operating system of google , which is in sharp competition with apple &apos;s and microsoft &apos;s mobile products .
in 2011 , google issued an initial bid of $ 900 million for nortel patents .
google has increased its offer several times and recently offered $ 4.4 billion .
after the nortel patents won over rockstar , google won the mobility-for-12,5 billion dollars , a business that also partly matched by motorola ’ s library of patents .
“ although google failed in its attempt to protect the patent litigation at the auction , google violated the patents and continues to do so , ” says the lawsuit .
rockstar demands a high compensation from google , because it claims that google &apos;s patent infringement is deliberate , so the accusation .
egypt swore first freely elected presidents
mohammed morsi is abandoning the oath of office , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thereby ending the country ’ s succession of hosni mubarak , who had been in power for 16 months .
with his inauguration in the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , who are sitting on the nile and are replicating an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said morsi during the ceremony broadcast live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” said morsi , a 60-year-old engineer trained in the us and a member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guards guarded the building when morsi arrived in the city shortly after 11 o &apos;clock in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to rejoice with the new president , and , unlike the presidential whimsical triumph from the mubarak period , the traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the car would be crowded .
as an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been mocked since his victory and a friday speech in which he has not only stood as a candidate of the islamists , but also all .
“ egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue suit with red tie , and he declared to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber .
morsi later went to cairo university , where he was supposed to deliver his inaugural address .
he was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem , who he listened to in the habit .
military leader feldmarshal hussein tantawi was present .
on his arrival , hundreds of people present in the university &apos;s largest auditorium , he was accompanied by a voice choir from “ the army and the people are a hand . ”
the bastion secular education built in 1908 by cairo university has been a centre of cultural and cultural interest in the 1970s .
morsi laid a symbolic oath on tahir square on friday , the birthplace of the uprising that ended last year with mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he praised it .
but with the formal oath taken to the court and not , as usual , before parliament , he is bowing to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger disco cater for two great evenings .
the new season at falkenberger diskothek &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .
today &apos;s friday evening is called &quot; pump this party &quot; , on saturday evening tomorrow it &apos;s about 25-party .
fat beats and cool sounds are naturally played on both days .
workers crashed by leaders : severely hurt

the man from lamprechthausen wanted to find a defective heating sensor on the exterior of a inn .

he suffered serious injuries and was killed with the rescue helicopter &quot; christophorus 6 &quot; in the state hospital salzburg .
rapist in south africa : two lifelong detention
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the perpetrator was condemned twice on friday .
the transmitter sabc reported this .
the victim had died later from the consequences of the serious injuries .
johannes kana was already guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime .
the act had caused horror across the country .
the then 21-year-old had anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours of the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in vain .
the sight of young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological support .
kana admitted during the process that he had to go to a bar at the night of the day .
he also confessed to beaten and raped them , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed several perpetrators , but they released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecutor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that kana was alone at the time of the attack .
rape is a common occurrence in south africa : every year there are about 64 000 indications of sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it has a population of 82 million , and a population of 82 million people , which is significantly more than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women ’ s associations in south africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times .

the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i &apos;m curious if your roberto blanco measures what happens then &quot; , jumbo cynical .
here the level of private television is presented in a pure culture .

they thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and expects record income from holidaymakers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now assuming a adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $ 325 and 340 million , compared to $ 305 to 315 million in its earlier forecast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means a growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director graham turner announced , flight centre achieved eight percent profit and achieved a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in australia and the uk .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he said .
this includes australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earnings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , which made it possible to have a slightly weaker business travel market .
it was similarly good for the flight centre leisure business in the uk , while here , too , business customers spend less .
the us business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so that for the third consecutive year , a profit is expected for the full year .
the shares of flight centre increased by 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday .
schools will become more focused on mathematics , spelling and grammar .
in english literature courses , students will have to learn at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic poetry , and contemporary british novels from 1914 .
the exam also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage wider reading .
the combined course of english literature and language will be abolished .
from 2015 , students must take an independent gcse language test , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will be publishing the new curricula for english and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects radically redesigned .
other key subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , the audit supervisory authority , will propose a reorganisation of the gcse structures , including a new benotyping system and less price work .
in a summer speech , the minister for education michael gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasizing that gcses would “ challenge ” .
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
australia &apos;s schools , on the other hand , teach 143 hours a year and students in singapore receive 138 hours .
there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathematics in the timetable , but coalition circles say that the comprehensive mathematical test – combined with a stronger degree of weighting of the subject in terms of its importance – is being encouraged .
the curriculum focuses more on “ problems of the right life ” , including financial mathematics .

if people had known too much of this over the past centuries , and had put on those images of heaven and hell , &quot; which have shaped our ideas to date &quot; , the contemporary prophetic teaching is drawing from the sun .

in the ladies it was theresa duelli of the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning stadium .

in the main race , more absolute topbrates were on the start this year .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free health care
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance to remote villages in cameroon .
bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients , and they are the only ones who have the right to care for their patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people , but one for 5,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile phone .
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can go to the top 10 for him or one of the other heroes to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle was watching his sick father again and again loose consciousness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near yaounde , the capital of cameroon .
first , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation was formed , which was spread to his brain and where a hematom caused a damage to him for the rest of his life .
“ there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we would have brought him out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals , helping his father to get treatment there that she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bwelle .
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bwell &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor per 5 000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , in the united states , the ratio is between a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most cameramen could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem they have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered in bwelle , which decided to do anything about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and worked as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaouné .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and travel with the finished medical equipment on the roof over untightened terrain into the villages that need help .
not everything is always going smoothly .
they have already had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
but when they arrive they will receive like heroes : a banquet , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration .
the next morning the team will start studying hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per trip ” , says bwelle .
they come from a 60 km radius around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being tortured because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carries out simple surgery with local anaesthesia .
the operations are normally carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the procedure , the patients are standing up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so bwelle and its volunteers work until the early hours of sunday .
it is a tiring bet , but village musicians usually help motivate the team .
“ they are drumming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says bwelle .
on sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help .
a man explained that the free operation of a trunk he received now allows him to work again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works at night in private clinics in yaounde .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who was at drexel university in philadelphia medicine for the second year and volunteered to work in bwelles group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
“ we can be there where we help to absorb blood or to use the instruments for dr. bwelle ” , explains o &apos;malley .
this would never be possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their travel to cameroon themselves and bring their health-care material with them .
but once you are in yaounde , bwelle will take over the accommodation , transport and instruction .
“ he is undoubtedly a hero , ” says o &apos;malley .
he dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the cameroon people knows no boundaries .
for bwelle , almost constant work is not a burden .
helping others to live happier lives , fulfilling a promise he made to his father , gives him great pleasure .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain .

excellent fighting mastered
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson cut to the body .
janson was a member of the star trek : deep space nine academy .
nobody can help the old man santiago in fishing .
the two complement each other very well .
it is almost said that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman &apos;s boy manolo speaks , can be seen .
when santiago is tired of life , sitting on the chair , janson is very close .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is by and by a character that janson excellently manages .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and who ultimately , through his knowledge and his will , wins the battle against the fish .
janson is widely regarded as the sole actor on stage .
it manages to focus the audience ’ s attention so that its monologues do not bored for a moment .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only shining from blue water bottles .
director jens hasselmann lets the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he puts the active scene into the light : the cabin of santiago , the bar of singer marie-luise gunst , who is connected with her songs and her splendid voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the city of cologne is situated on a canal of sewage from the roman period .
if you visit cologne , you will not pass the cathedral .
the two towers rise into the sky around 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers suspect that it is also a lot to discover under the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in the subject of cologne ’ s unterwelt .
the service center of cologne tourism is located directly at the dom .
the tour starts unspectacularly : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a city that is accessible by car , and therefore the remains of the old city walls were only standing in the way of what was not too great .
most users of the car park are therefore rushing past the roman remains and they are only leaving their car .
but if you look more closely , you will find a metal mesh separated from the metal grid in the park deck d2 .
the ruins of the handleger bricks are about five metres high .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city walls that came to be erected after christ in the second half of the first century , &quot; schulze tells .
before it goes back to the daylight , schulze leaves participants in the upper parking level a glance at a dark , 15 meters deep shaft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , is hardly noticed .
the next stop of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants descend down to the depth .
we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the precursor of the ccaa .
what ccaa means , a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city roman law and city of agrippinenser , founded under the name of &quot; .
and the pretorium is the former statue palace , the power center of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the vorbereich of the exhibition , a tunnel access leads to the roman sewage channel , which is preserved here in a length of about 120 metres .
&quot; you can easily follow a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want &quot; , schulze encourages the guests .
schulze still has a surprise .
after having collected the key at the checkout , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater , which was indispensable for ritual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , has seen the varying levels of water through changing levels of the rhine .
the mikwe are part of an archaeological area on the town hall square , for which construction work is due to begin shortly .
however , a few years will pass before completion .
leg almost unhacked : reissue of rocker process
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu will be rerolled after more than four years .
a trial for attempted death killings , dangerous body injury and damage to property against two thirty years has begun before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safety measures .
the defendants remain silent on the start .
they are said to have been active in the rock scene and have been part of the banddidos at that time .
the prosecutor accuses you of being in the office of finowfurt in june 2009 , together with unknown accomplices , in a car and having taken action on three men .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .
the victims are to be part of the competing group of hell angels .
one is to have been a high-ranking member from berlin .
it seems that preceded this was a chase with several cars .
according to the indictment , they were about revolving battles and a power demonstration .
the two defendants were acquitted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spokesman said then that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice suspended the ruling after the revisation of the public prosecutor and referred it back to the court for further negotiation .
one of the defendants is currently in open execution because of another offence .
the first step was to reconstruct the processes of the tatnacht .
as a witness , the commissioner who was investigating at the time was invited .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the defendants and other people who had been intercepted by the police .
it is difficult that rockers almost always abide by a law that they respect - not statements - in court .
that also applies to the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims had been caught .
stefan golfier of the frankfurt prosecutor &apos;s office ( oder ) said on request that new donations have been found since the last trial .
eleven more negotiating days are set for the process .
the dispossessed society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the peasants of people on the front-passenger and back seat , hunger is noticeable .
of course , there may be some cocktail or sparkling wine to blame for this !
what is more obvious than chilling to drive to the next drive-in to get a little bit of satisfaction ?
i admit i am happy to be with you when it comes to late night or early morning food .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as if home and in bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable .
because what should you miss if you keep on regularly reviewing your fast-food bags from the car window ? !
the most popular street is the &quot; old town &quot; , which is a popular street street street street street street with a lot of shops and restaurants .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people to doof to bring the bags home respectable to the next bin ?
it is not only that the paper producer has shunned the landscape .
bags have already covered traffic facilities such as landing planks and have caused accidents .
about what does said &quot; throw-away society &quot; not think about , but probably they do not even know what this word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .
there would be a few bags more or less nowhere - unlike the road where nobody could find the food residue of other tramps .
i can see that the day is already coming when cities and municipalities will be left to shut their feet - and the fast-food chains will require a deposit for their bags .
obama ’ s health backsliding
following intense criticism , president obama withdrew yesterday from his often repeated , clear promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have received a letter of cancellation from their insurer , the republicans have recently accused the president of having shouted the american public .
yesterday , obama relatived his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in boston .
in response to the many media reports on the redundancies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to seek a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast .
“ they come up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government found it unsurprising that five percent of the population , who have taken out insurance themselves , had to look for a different tariff , because their treaty was not in line with the new standards of the affordable recare .
“ i would like to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” sebelius said at a hearing before the representative ’ s house ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
sebelius , responsible for implementing the affordable care act , explained that the launch of the online platform since october “ miserable ” .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as any other , ” she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this statement by an angry sebelius as a behind her sitting advisor at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives was made following a dispute with the republican mep , billy long , from missouri .
after more than three hours of hearing , long sebelius repeatedly pressed the question why the “ architect ” of the affordable care act should not be voluntarily limited to a government-sponsored insurance .
government in jerusalem confirmed attack on syrian air base
an american official who wanted to remain anonymous sent a letter to the american news station cnn on thursday to the israeli fighter planes that had been flying a day earlier .
the goal is &quot; missiles and related equipment &quot; , which the israeli government feared were responsible for lebanon &apos;s hizbollah .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab al-arabiya channel , had previously reported that the base in the port city of latakia was shelled on thursday night , wednesday night , and the israelis .
the israeli tv channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in latakia , on which russian defensive missiles of type s-125 newa and a battery of sa-3 missiles were built .
unsure the government in jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes an equally anonymous israeli government official in the words that israel believes that it has carried out the attack , but is not safe .
one speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said at least : &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
ron ben-yishai , the journalist , stressed in yedioth ahronoth that syrian regime had been able to prevent the use of boil-air missiles in the country before , sometimes successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by syria to expose hezbollah to chemical or other dangerous weapons would undermine the country ’ s transgression of a red line .
john kerry , in an unprecedented admission , declared that the us espionage was “ inappropriately gone too far . ”
john kerry implied an unexpected admission that the defensive stance of the us in relation to its surveillance programs was not being weakened by the spirits that were in some cases “ unreasonable . ”
the foreign minister also admitted that he , together with barack obama , was responsible for “ autopilot ” , when the explosive forces were exposed .
the leaked information has turned the us government into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .
in a video conversation at the open government conference in london , kerry said , “ there is no question that the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have been virtually expired by autopilot .
he was the first high ranking member of the us administration to admit that us espionage had crossed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been abused .
he said : ‘ in some cases , this has gone too far too far . ’
the president is determined to clarify the situation and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuses are taking place here .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa be a force of good , and that their monitoring processes saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to take their own breath . ”
there is radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people , getting them into the air and attacking governments .
so what would be the case if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we are not aware of such plans before .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the supposed american espionage , and to convince europeans of the need to make progress on counter-terrorism efforts with the us , as we have seen in the past .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had met representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to complain about the frustration of national security surveillance .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans are not too weak in our collective efforts against terrorism . ” said murphy , the president of the democratic party for the first time in the senate , who is sitting in the chamber .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have further strained relations with some us allies , even though the intelligence head this week said that the reports were incorrect and based on the information he gave .
other revelations cited the use of the nsa in documents passed on by snowden , according to which the nsa had used the phone of chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james clapper , defended spying on allies as necessary , and said that this was customary on both sides .
in all this turmoil , murphy said that his authority was preparing for the congress ’ s visit , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other members participating will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be worked out .
while murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also spoke of some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes they have been using for years .
“ although we can change our surveillance programmes , thereby better protecting the rights of europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” murphy says .
meanwhile , john kerry is planning a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to meet the resentment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

australian woman is filing a case against prison sentence in thailand .
a 21-year-old woman from sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in phuket because she had wrongly claimed to be raped by a taxi driver has voted against the sentence .
stevie rochelle bamford was first convicted by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june , to have made a false statement after being handed over to the thai police .
later , however , the shots of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they confessed to have devised the story .
until the court hearing , she was in police custody on the spot .
bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security prison at the margins of phuket , rather than in a prison for adults .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who addressed the canberra foreign office with the request for help for his daughter .
tunks declared to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that they will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford appealed against the judgment and is against a baht deposit of 50,000 baht at large .
australian reports have said that they have meanwhile been living in the holiday resort of krabi in southern thailand .
the court said that bamford was being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket and was warned that the profession would also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in prison .
however , thailand may also be the first country to become a member of the united states after the recent murder of the pimp , michelle smith .
