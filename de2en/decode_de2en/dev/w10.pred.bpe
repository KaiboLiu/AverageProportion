gu@@ t@@ ach : more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday the new b 3@@ 3-@@ pede@@ strian light is set up in gu@@ t@@ ach .
two sites so close to each other : intention or tor@@ to@@ is@@ es@@ v@@ n ?
this question was clearly answered by gu@@ ta@@ x &apos;s may@@ or yesterday .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it sec@@ ures the school path &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ amp@@ el is safe for cy@@ cli@@ sts , bus passengers and mountain residents .
the plant officially started yesterday is important for the cru@@ ise area sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
we have the museum , two churches , kur@@ park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; with the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic , another traffic light had to be built for their safety &quot; , ec@@ ker@@ t says .
this is also confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the federal state council office in off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , around 12 000 vehicles pass through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach every day , of which about 10 % are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; ar@@ no@@ ld emphasi@@ zes .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just before this &quot; , says ar@@ no@@ ld .
four traffic surve@@ ys were carried out , and one roun@@ d@@ about was also envis@@ aged , but because of the narrow in the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e junction .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the choice of location of the traffic light ma@@ sts was tested before : &quot; by means of an extra charge for us with particularly long tim@@ ber tr@@ un@@ ks , we have tested whether these vehicles from the sul@@ zer .
the traffic light system , which costs about 15 000 euros , is the &quot; most modern of all , which is currently on the market &quot; , explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
the system is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds that l@@ end so strong that the lights are lit by the drivers , for example , even when the sun is deep .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three lights per direction .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new system : this one is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic lights , the upper rad@@ ar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pede@@ strian comes directly green , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian can be termin@@ ated .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go out on the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safe@@ ly via the road , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , mo@@ tori@@ sts must think together and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic lights for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , a super@@ class vehicle noise through - at bright red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been working for more than 30 years to reli@@ eve the p@@ light of his child@@ hood and youth from the soul .
the disasters of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of language , the tend@@ ency to raw violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the close and jo@@ y@@ ful@@ ness - dis@@ appeared the car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et many times .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner prize winner is known mainly as a pro@@ se author , theatre texts are in his work ra@@ r .
coll@@ age from pro@@ sa@@ tex@@ tes ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er presents &quot; me@@ te@@ or@@ ological lu@@ min@@ ai@@ res on ton@@ gue tip &quot; , which is now available in garage x on saint peter &apos;s square .
the theatre maker combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graphical novel &quot; the ser@@ p@@ ent &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ in@@ at@@ ur@@ i@@ um from &quot; cor@@ p@@ us , his family &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirement : a cr@@ acked and un@@ ti@@ l@@ ted sof@@ a , where the impression is given that the sound is being ma@@ pped , han@@ gs over the eigh@@ t-@@ head head .
director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little confidence in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance over@@ t@@ ones the template with a wealth of director &apos;s in@@ jur@@ ies , known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post-@@ dramatic forms of play .
the actors in particular come to the stage in sometimes rather question@@ able scen@@ ic trans@@ positions .
they are har@@ d-@@ pressed , they are di@@ pped with their heads under water , they are tor@@ n to the wall with their evening ro@@ bes .
en@@ velo@@ ped in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ an or mi@@ gs , they st@@ ack on danger@@ ously high stic@@ ks through the st@@ aging , either mono@@ lo@@ gue them lou@@ dly or lie sil@@ ently on the stage floor .
the text is bare@@ ly medi@@ ated in this har@@ d-@@ working way .
the best moments is the evening when sung - the band@@ width ran@@ ges from deep pur@@ ple to fol@@ k song .
only towards the end will the over@@ turned performance become a bit of a rest , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s absur@@ d hum@@ or is fl@@ ash@@ ing .
a black@@ box in the car ?
american street pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to break the dec@@ lining high@@ way system , and believe the solution in a small black box .
the devices that record every kil@@ ome@@ tre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial washington attempt and the planning offices of the states that are ob@@ sole@@ te systems for financing us military operations .
this normally bor@@ ing area of road planning has suddenly opened an intensive debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ t@@ arians have joined with environmental groups and advoc@@ ate that the government should use the small boxes to record the kilometres that are being driven – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information to calcul@@ ate the costs .
the tea party is app@@ alled .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how they can change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay for each m@@ ile they drive .
thousands of mo@@ tori@@ sts have used the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring , already .
this is a really must for our country .
“ it is not something we will use only possibly , ” has@@ an i@@ kh@@ r@@ ata , managing director of southern california said .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , financed from taxes , is the american investment in the fuel dispens@@ ation .
but america is not d@@ ancing as much as it used to be .
cars con@@ sume less petro@@ l .
the national tax on min@@ eral oil of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 euro c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians d@@ are not to cut the tax even by a cent at high prices .
“ the gas@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert in traffic legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state recently sold 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s that would allow a mil@@ e-@@ based payment system to be tested .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it a mil@@ e@@ -based user fee .
not surpris@@ ingly , urban liber@@ als embr@@ ace the idea , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behavior in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and harmful ex@@ ha@@ ust g@@ ases are reduced .
califor@@ ni@@ an pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system to develop strategies to help the ambitious , legally en@@ shr@@ ined goals of the state on climate change .
but bill shu@@ ster , a republic@@ an of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also said that he has the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also inspired by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the distance they have travell@@ ed .
“ this is not a tax that dis@@ appears in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of policies at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , asked congress to move toward a m@@ ile based settlement .
the us sen@@ ate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year that includes 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move , respon@@ ding to concerns expressed by rural meps representing people who live in everyday life .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving on their own .
the most committed is o@@ reg@@ on , who currently has 5@@ ,000 ri@@ ders for the country ’ s biggest experim@@ ent .
these drivers will soon be paying the mil@@ e@@ age charges to the federal state instead of the tax on petro@@ le@@ um .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is testing it to a limited extent with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , to which the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast belong ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating how .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where 50 volunte@@ ers have recently been equipped with the equipment , mo@@ tori@@ sts were s@@ cep@@ tical about the idea that the government could follow any of their movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of strategy and result management in the ministry of transport of ne@@ v@@ ada , explains .
people did not want it .
when the test was launched , the ne@@ v@@ ada ac@@ l@@ u war@@ ned on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to convert the tac@@ ho@@ graph into full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to create a giant , bul@@ ky technological infrastructure that inevitably leads to the use of data on the daily movements of individual people .
ne@@ v@@ ada is part of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will enable the state to capture the miles that are driven , but not exactly when and where .
thus , according to kh@@ an , the public would also be more reas@@ su@@ red .
hun@@ ting for this technology has made some authorities into a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally set up to help states in tax@@ ing drivers .
rather , it was their goal to remain competitive in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are being held on the basis of the miles they have travell@@ ed .
but the devices it tested are also interesting for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and provide only limited information that is regularly up@@ loaded by mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , managing director of true mis@@ e@@ age explained .
some of these public pilot programmes have made big mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to implement this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , the pl@@ ann@@ ers experim@@ ent with offering drivers a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device at all and pay a flat rate based on the average travel expenses of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to sell the concept of a susp@@ icious public by using the devices with more functions than with less .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax@@ -@@ tax@@ ing device that can also pay parking fees , insurance only for driving kilometres must be paid , and speed data from other vehicles are collected in real time , thanks to which they can be ev@@ aded .
“ drivers would be more vulnerable to the benefits that the system offers , ” says the president of the commission , “ the added value of drivers .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers wonder , however , whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ str@@ action .
the metro@@ politan transportation commission for the san francis@@ co bay area announced that officials who had been in the congress could solve the problem of bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy highway trust fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-@@ time fee or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that con@@ sume little petro@@ l , so that they too can pay a fair share .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an asp@@ ir@@ in is enough , ” r@@ and@@ y r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the commission , explains .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .
kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d : small team is w@@ ack@@ er
the voluntary fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed to get its autumn main test through a lack of personnel .
only ele@@ ven people participated in the exercise .
he was the comm@@ ander of the department of the an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors of the estate in bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e .
the sa@@ wing process should have a short circuit .
the resulting fire and smo@@ ke caused in@@ jur@@ ies to two people , one of whom was able to send an emergency call .
two bre@@ a@@ thing protection carri@@ ers of the armed forces made themselves felt after the first review of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er .
after a short time , the first person was found and led into the open .
the second person had to be wor@@ n .
this was not so easy , as it was also possible to cross a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ les for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it stored a lot of wood and also stra@@ w bal@@ es in it .
there were also electric machines for wood processing .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing occurred over the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
another line was made from an over@@ floor hy@@ d@@ ran@@ ts at about 100 meters distance .
now three ran@@ so@@ m attacks could be designed .
the building also used a ca@@ ve b@@ lasting tube .
h@@ ans kam@@ mer@@ er also tried to show what was available with little money .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the daily operation group kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d .
the comm@@ ander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies
during his visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , the country ’ s president gui@@ do wol@@ f was also able to en@@ ligh@@ ten the future of the work@@ force in ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt .
in the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d support centre , he went to the management of the vocational schools as well as the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the parent advisory board chair on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ h@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school , emphasi@@ zed the net@@ worked school project &quot; ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d &quot; .
wol@@ f impres@@ sed himself with the model projects for education .
since 2011 , a successful cooperation has been established in the forest town between the f@@ ör@@ der@@ z@@ entr@@ um , the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational school centre .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly nature of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to take a look at the period of care for rela@@ tives due to demographic change , &quot; wol@@ f said .
he also said that more and more employees are looking after and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting work@@ force burden could lead to an end to working relations , &quot; said wol@@ f .
but no one can afford to lose skilled labor , he said .
another particularly important factor is the net@@ working of universities and companies .
&quot; because anyone who has already experienced the advantages of the region during his studies will be able to keep up with the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills , which will help to strengthen the region , &quot; the president of the country demonstrated .
only if there were sufficient training places could the need for skilled workers be met .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advant@@ ageous location in south-@@ west germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a great deal of progress on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg .
&quot; stay persi@@ stent and make sure that the public transport system is better , &quot; he said to the att@@ end@@ ant local politicians .
enjoy an enter@@ taining afternoon with music .
the k@@ au@@ l family has been inv@@ iting di@@ et@@ inger sen@@ i@@ ors to coffee , ca@@ ke and then a ves@@ per for 15 years .
in the past , the elderly were served in the re@@ sting place .
meanwhile , this afternoon is taking place in the nur@@ sing home of st. jo@@ se@@ f .
the home@@ -@@ d@@ well@@ ers enjoyed the delicious ca@@ kes and ca@@ kes .
later there was sa@@ usage sal@@ ad .

the over 100 years old stone wall , the front de@@ mar@@ c@@ ation of the old school building to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , which is standing in front of the renov@@ ation , is to be put back into the city br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before kil@@ big , the first work of re@@ hab@@ ilitation of the front school court was e@@ rec@@ ted a small wall , to stab@@ ili@@ ze and reli@@ eve sta@@ tic relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the next step is to remove alexander mis@@ ok from br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ ba@@ um@@ am@@ t , the national mon@@ ument office , and to develop a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
after that , a cost calcul@@ ation will be carried out by experts who will then be notified to the municip@@ al council to decide and determine the way forward .
a decision on this will probably be taken as early as next year .
after the re@@ hab@@ ilitation , pav@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old school building inside the two sides of the school built in 19@@ 12 , the school must be re@@ constructed in the fores@@ ee@@ able future as a follow-up to the wall for renov@@ ation .
the historic , one hundred year old for@@ ti@@ fication wall of the old school building to the church street is mainly due to water and fro@@ st damage , as there is no dra@@ in@@ age , and has a bo@@ w cur@@ tain .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .
a stable wall is a pre@@ requisite for a school cour@@ ty@@ ard used by students , which has been done through the current for@@ ti@@ fication work .
the school court renov@@ ation was even planned in 200@@ 8-@@ 2009 , but high un@@ scheduled expenditure resulted in a postpon@@ ement .
an important word in the historical restoration of school walls , which has even been used for film rec@@ ord@@ ings , will be taken on board by the national mon@@ ument office .
if the targets come from this side , the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en hopes to receive grants from the mon@@ um@@ ental preser@@ vers .
the students of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er ele@@ mentary school , which is now back in a well-@@ renovated old school building with a new a@@ ula , can soon use the old school yard .
o@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to receive jazz training in stutt@@ gart .
in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the greens , has now joined in .
&quot; i think it is wrong to continue ho@@ lis@@ tic education at the stutt@@ gart music college , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir the stutt@@ gart news .
jazz and classical music are part of the jazz location stutt@@ gart .
this is a contradic@@ tion between ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who was chosen in stutt@@ gart as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , and the green red government .
this is a step forward in the re@@ organization of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg , based on an expert study .
the programme will then include jazz and pop studies from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim .
u.s. border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling
on the mex@@ ic@@ an border with the us , investig@@ ators have created a &apos; super tunnel &apos; for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling and have dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long pi@@ pe between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and an aer@@ ation plant .
three susp@@ ects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were se@@ ized .
according to the data , the tunnel has not yet been used .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if they think they could di@@ g under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the att@@ or@@ ney general of the us district southern california .
du@@ ff@@ y , who was looking at the drug gan@@ gs , said : &quot; if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with dru@@ g-@@ related crime .
by experts constructed
due to the elabor@@ ate equipment of the tunnel , the investig@@ ators assume that it is designed by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction takes about a year .
the track was equipped to allow electric cars to be used there .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , the access is in a building 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der leads to the depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 metres high and a width of 90 cm .
it would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was sent@@ enced to death for the se@@ iz@@ ure of mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three are threatened with life imprison@@ ment as a maximum pun@@ ishment , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered , and the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go continued .
but it is the first time that co@@ ca@@ ine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
usually co@@ ca@@ ine is s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in smaller quantities , not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &apos; des@@ pair &apos; of the drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sh@@ er@@ man of the de@@ a drug search in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything they could to get to the us .
no details have been given about the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one was mex@@ ic@@ an , as they were told .
they must expect prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 is the year of the ge@@ is@@ inger fe@@ ast
the ju@@ bil@@ ee of the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
return of the first reference to documents is drawing ever closer .
if the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year will come .
the church was built in 7@@ 94 for the first time by the ho@@ loc@@ a@@ ust and the church house .
a document was produced in churches men@@ tioning both places .
on 15 march , an official start to the anniversary year is due , and as ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en does not have a hall at the moment , this opening event takes place in the place where they were first mentioned 12@@ 50 years ago .
during the anniversary , several events are held in both ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th .
re@@ vers@@ al .
on friday with a cere@@ mony , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the kir@@ ch@@ tal@@ hal@@ le .
this weekend is also the weekend of the church festival in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en@@ er .
city music director ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th has announced a contract for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is being performed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the son@@ n@@ w@@ end@@ fe@@ i@@ er des sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on july 12 in the arena with fire@@ works and on december 13 , the first concert of city music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
this will be completed and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated in the year of ju@@ bil@@ ee , the official appointment is on the last weekend of september , on 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also being released .
&quot; but it is not just a chron@@ ic@@ le of ho@@ stages themselves , but a printed work about today &apos;s ho@@ stag@@ e-@@ sing@@ ing , which is made up of ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en , kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en , le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g , fing@@ ers .
and today ’ s ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en is also celebr@@ ating 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , in 197@@ 4 the modern space was completed with the involvement .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 is another year with many ju@@ bil@@ ee years .
the fo@@ li@@ age of stra@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki begins on february 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmony gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen is being 90 years and has the ban@@ quet on march 29 and march 4 .
the le@@ ip@@ hr@@ d@@ ingen plant is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger sch@@ u@@ le has been in the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes this on may 10 , the poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ hr@@ d@@ ingen music association is 150 years old and celebrated .
the city of ge@@ is@@ ingen was founded in a gift certificate owned by the monaster@@ y of st. g@@ allen in 7@@ 64 for the first time .
the document was produced in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then a court square .
both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .
reason 20@@ 14 of this 12@@ 50 year old to celebrate accordingly , in addition , the municip@@ al reform is 40 years old .
r@@ at aims to develop railway systems and to develop rail systems .
should the railway crossing be re@@ constructed &quot; on the de@@ er &quot; in order to increase road safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must provide eur 2@@ 20 000 for this .
deutsche bahn is planning to open the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line next year .
in particular , it aims to increase safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings - there are regular conflicts between trains and other vehicles throughout germany .
if the municip@@ alities agree to the reconstruction measures , they must contribute with a third of the costs , the rest are divided into the railways and the con@@ federation .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach ’ s city buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the municip@@ al council the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ arities of the ba@@ h@@ ü@@ ber@@ gan@@ g “ am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en ” .
the city plans to build a new railway station in the same building as the tunnel mun@@ d to the west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long@@ wood , could also be standing there in return without having to block the tracks .
greek people therefore proposed that a necessary support wall be constructed in such a way that the city would be able to extend the road that followed in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed controversial in the municip@@ al council , as some counc@@ ils ques@@ tioned the need for road traffic : thomas ki@@ p@@ p , by expressing his opinion , brought the s@@ enti@@ ment of the cri@@ tics to the point : &quot; do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? &quot; .
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as dis@@ agreed : the railway crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ tim@@ ber trans@@ ports .
even wood from the area &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; is partly trans@@ ported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long do not have the possibility to use the route at the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les bridge because they could not turn into the main road .
the route also serves as a route for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel if the main road is closed , ham@@ as@@ . the road is a good example of this .
it is to be expected that kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tun@@ nels will have to be re@@ built and re@@ built , as is currently the case in wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g , that the railway crossing &quot; am &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; could also have a significance for a longer .
the counc@@ ils agreed to investigate the costs of the planned broad@@ ening of the road .
despite this , the majority of the members of the european parliament have agreed to the restructuring of the railway transition , with the requirement that the necessary support walls be built so that the city can use the next road towards &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se &quot; .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at ger@@ ber@@ ia tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem , which could hin@@ der access to the so@@ aring &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user &quot; .
the administration had taken over the railway restructuring plans from the engineering firm bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user was possible without further ado .
the investigation concluded that it is not possible to exclu@@ de the possibility that the ti@@ lt of the road could lead to longer vehicles being placed on the road .
the city is responsible for this as a road lo@@ ad@@ er .
the reconstruction could therefore lead to disputes regarding liability .
since both the lo@@ gging and the ben@@ ding in the current state of the construction work worked , the re@@ building of the railway crossing should not be agreed , ha@@ as argu@@ ed .
the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion with a fixed ro@@ tor on the passing vehicle is much less than that of the other rail cros@@ s@@ ings , because the central stop is right next to it , with a good vi@@ sibility connection .
even trains from the central station would have to be bra@@ ked to the point that there is no threat of col@@ li@@ sion .
the majority of the people refused to approve the change of the railway crossing , since the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach had to &quot; ba@@ the out &quot; the problem with vehicles sitting on the site , as the railway was closed down after the construction work had been completed .
the board considers the re@@ construc@@ tions at the railway cros@@ s@@ ings &quot; before heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; v@@ or ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; , for which the cros@@ s@@ roads with the railway have already been made .
es@@ a deci@@ des on large space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of dollars of space missions : missions for bil@@ lions of euros
far plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects that they will be starting in the coming years .
thir@@ ty proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
far from the world .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : to look for gra@@ vity waves .
or rather explore the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or search for earth like plan@@ ets , and thus discover ali@@ en life ?
these are the questions which the european space agency , es@@ a , is currently in charge of .
for your program &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is about eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
in early september , the european space research elite met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were under discussion , five of them now have come to a close vote .
many bodies are considering the proposals to make a few changes to researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
in total , four major questions have been selected by the es@@ a , to which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme initiated in 2007 should find answers .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and lives ?
the exact processes involved in the formation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus also the formation of plan@@ ets that en@@ circle these stars - are still in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dark .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
in order to address this issue , the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; , which is supposed to be used to transport 500 plan@@ etary systems already known to us in the vicinity of the planet , is to be launched in 20@@ 17 .
but the possibilities are limited , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map ear@@ th-@@ like plan@@ ets and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , thus looking for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered to be indic@@ ations of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , should ultimately be considered as to the conditions for the creation of life .
magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and the partic@@ le radiation em@@ it@@ ted by it with the plan@@ etary system .
in our solar system , these processes can be ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
with the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; , the es@@ a has already launched a m-@@ class mission ( which is where the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .
the pro@@ be is scheduled to start in 20@@ 17 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
ju@@ pi@@ ter and his mon@@ ks are also of great interest to researchers .
you want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a sees this as the first of the three l missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) is expected to start its journey in 20@@ 22 .
after eight years , she reached j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and was supposed to be the atmosphere of the planet and the ic@@ y mo@@ ons of europe , k@@ all@@ is@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to study whether the known nature laws are always there .
perhaps there are also de@@ vi@@ ations that will show physi@@ ci@@ sts the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it made of ?
our co@@ smo@@ s ar@@ ose 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago through the big ban@@ g .
besides the matter we know from which stars , plan@@ ets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter , whose gra@@ vity gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies are gal@@ ax@@ ies .
so far , researchers have neither known what physical laws are in the first fr@@ action of the big ban@@ g , nor what is dar@@ ker material to be derived from .
with &quot; eu@@ c@@ li@@ d &quot; , the es@@ a has already approved a m mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
the pro@@ be is to be used to determine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thereby providing a basis for the composition of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
the best chan@@ ces for an l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a challenging concept for detec@@ ting gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
this includes physi@@ ci@@ sts ’ changes in the structure of space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could manage this , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees a detec@@ tor consisting of two or three prob@@ es , which is sta@@ tioned in space .
unlike plants on earth , it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are not present in the big ban@@ g , thus gaining new insi@@ ghts into the co@@ smo@@ s ’ development .
four more proposals still compete to the second l mission : a large x-@@ ray sensor called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which includes black sol@@ es .
some of the suggestions for the return of sam@@ ples from mar@@ s , for research into the moon , ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ ids , as well as for solar physi@@ cs , have already been with@@ drawn .
snow@@ den is ready to “ cooperate ” with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to promise to be on board before the german parliament if the american national security agency and its director do not provide rep@@ lies .
german me@@ p han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le met snow@@ den in russia on thursday , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , which was sent to the media in berlin on friday , he wrote : “ even if the result of my efforts was demonstr@@ ably positive , my government is tre@@ ating a dis@@ sent as a sta@@ un@@ ch opinion .
but to say the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the american government to drop the charge against him .
the prosecu@@ tion brought by the us department of justice includes es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of state property .
german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said to time online : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to speak with german representatives , we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us@@ -@@ germany relations are bur@@ den@@ ed by the claims that the n@@ sa has not yet used chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s mobile phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that it was necessary to se@@ ize the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den as a witness if this was possible , ‘ to end@@ an@@ ger relations without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing them ’ and to completely break the us .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a green me@@ p , published a picture of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was accompanied during his visit to russia by two german journalists .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee , snow@@ den could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snow@@ den in germany says , then he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable member says .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he is committed to “ serious and ongoing ” persecu@@ tion , which he has launched from his home country .
it is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have been broad@@ ly monitoring rev@@ el@@ ations of an un@@ controlled system of surveillance as a virtu@@ e of the public .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes an offer of cooperation to the german authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges hand bag@@ gage fees .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to purchase up to usd 100 from passengers travelling on their flight hand bag@@ gage .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to pay up to usd 100 for one piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even if the announcement on wednesday was read that passengers were not allowed to use the whole do@@ se .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the luggage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags below the seat are still free .
fronti@@ er said that you will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 for travellers arriving at the gate .
fron@@ ter speaker k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the charge of $ 100 targets to move travellers to the pre-@@ paid by the payment .
“ we don ’ t want to calcul@@ ate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines started to work for the first and second piece of bag@@ gage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to avoid them therefore have as much as possible in their hand bag@@ gage , which means that they have to leave the luggage com@@ part@@ ments above the seat .
charges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it concerns the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who would have clearly said that it would be increasingly difficult to find a place in the com@@ part@@ ment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the fronti@@ er platform may bring one piece of bag@@ gage with him free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained the site of fronti@@ er and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the gate .
the new fronti@@ er hand bag@@ gage fee will only come into force in the summer , and there will be no exact date yet .
passengers often s@@ wal@@ low bag@@ gage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .
they argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .
many on wall street view the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most , however , have so far left fing@@ ers of charges for hand bag@@ gage .
spirit airlines inc@@ . was the first to charge hand bag@@ gage three years ago and later , alle@@ gi@@ ant air , also received a low-@@ cost airline .
the only other airline with such a charge is the hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , said the airline consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who is closely following the extra charges .
in a report of december 2011 , he estimated that the hand bag@@ gage fee spirit will bring in usd 50 million per year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who form@@ erly held a leading position at mid@@ west airlines , recently joined the group with spirit and was cur@@ ious to hear what he had to say at the gate .
“ the boarding process was one of the most fr@@ ic@@ tion@@ less i have seen in my career in aviation , ” he said .
i expected to see t@@ ame and tangible discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding ran as lu@@ br@@ ic@@ ated . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit in the 2 dollars spent on coffee , tea , lim@@ on@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company stated that passengers who buy le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice should retain the whole can and drink coffee for free .
water is still free .
in 2008 , us air@@ ways had attemp@@ ted to make money for soft drinks , but this made it back seven months later , after passengers compla@@ ined and had not received any other large company .
fronti@@ ers step to charge for hand bag@@ gage if passengers are not directly buying from the airline is the latest initiative to allow customers to check their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy them directly from them rather than through an online travel agency .
however , fronti@@ er has gone fur@@ th@@ est in this area .
in september , the company started to make half as many frequent flights when booking through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , the miles were again reduced to 25 percent of the flight .
a flight tour booked with a third party supplier with fronti@@ er over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers may also only book seats when buying them directly on the fronti@@ er website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its den@@ ver headquarters , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
revenues fell by 9 % and flight capacity fell by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as reported in the financial report , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republic air@@ ways .
republic has tried to finance the financial of fronti@@ er in the context of the sale of the company .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the ev@@ angel@@ ical par@@ ish of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the house of the municip@@ ality was &quot; bi@@ ble pro@@ ver@@ bs &quot; and &quot; medieval words &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lec@@ ture on the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain wis@@ dom , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs with the corresponding bi@@ ble places and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : hol@@ z@@ z@@ z@@ ei@@ ge se@@ hen w@@ ach@@ st , wi@@ e sch@@ u@@ pp@@ en von den au@@ gen , e@@ h@@ ren an eye at someone who gives his man &apos;s sle@@ eping , w@@ ash his hands of blame .
the speaker also advis@@ ed her list@@ en@@ ers several times what the saying was .
the words of the middle ages were taken up by the church counc@@ ill@@ or , christ@@ el de@@ h@@ ner : all good things are three , make blue , make something ha@@ w@@ k .
she explained the meaning and origin of the words they call &quot; brid@@ ges to the past &quot; .
the ra@@ ff@@ le was finally lost .
the prices were on a table covered with hum@@ or and were en@@ co@@ ded before they were handed over to the winners .
the breakfast was very good and the staff were very friendly and helpful .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled people in tourism
the first german railway company to start a pilot project for the tourism industry at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g@@ is@@ che see@@ plat@@ te .
under the leadership of the german labour agency , 49 women and men who are already working as un@@ skilled workers in the industry are to be qualified for hotel and catering professionals over three winter periods .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses end with degrees , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t , the neu@@ brand@@ enburg employment agency .
the benefits are varied : it would not make participants unemployed , firms would have trained professionals who would be increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would have to avoid paying for unemployment .
the project also involves the chamber of commerce and industry in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( de@@ ho@@ ga ) mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ vor@@ pom@@ mer@@ n .
n@@ sa explains that an “ internal error ” and not h@@ ack@@ ers are to blame for the cr@@ ash of the website .
the shadow national security agency declared late on friday that a bug had caused your public website to par@@ aly@@ se some hours and not h@@ ack@@ ers , as was claimed online .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was un@@ reach@@ able for several hours this night , because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the sp@@ y agency explained in an e-mail sent to the server .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) was not true .
in the early evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers had noticed that the n@@ sa website was not reach@@ able for at least six hours and that this is still not for some users .
previously , a n@@ sa speaker had declared to ab@@ c news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not com@@ promised in any way . ”
secret information is not in danger , the spo@@ kes@@ man says .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ sts claimed to have the n@@ sa website loaded with a d@@ dos attack .
in such attacks , the target website is floo@@ ded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to inter@@ f@@ ere in the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super@@ -@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no such agency , is now in the light of the public and sees itself as the most important in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the secret service fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cy@@ per@@ operation .
a s@@ light decline has occurred in the number of people without jobs in october , by 22 to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the 3.@@ 1 % quota is better than last year and better than it was in september , &quot; we had hoped for more &quot; , says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty head of the agency .
many companies have re@@ acted to at@@ titu@@ des .
one reason is , according to fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the craft , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
since september , the number of staff in the hotel and restaurant sector has increased year-@@ on-@@ year .
in mid-@@ december the winter season begins there .

the loss of profits in bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er after a fall in supply and orders
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and railway manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc announced a 15@@ -@@ percent decline in net profit on thursday after having been hit by dec@@ lining orders and deli@@ veries of aircraft in the third quarter .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for his br@@ and-@@ new aircraft of the c@@ series , nor did it provide any new information as to whether the aircraft will be ready for commercial use next september .
the aircraft will be flying in the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , which makes it question@@ able whether the test phase will proceed as planned .
the results were less than forec@@ asts , leading to a fall in the price of more than eight percent on the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , lo@@ wered his assessment of “ out@@ performance ” on thursday to “ sector performance ” in view of the fact that the share will be in the next one to two quarters .
“ while weak@@ er delivery numbers on aircraft were widely expected , the mar@@ gin in transport has not been fully dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a letter to customer .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er has received new orders for the c@@ series when the test program for the aircraft is progres@@ sing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more s@@ cep@@ tical about the program .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the aircraft gra@@ vi@@ es of the c@@ series will take the company to the lower market segment , which is currently being developed by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w in september after months of delays .
but until now , binding orders for the c@@ series have been moderate , as potential bu@@ yers are waiting for and want to see the results of flight tests whether the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new no@@ zz@@ le are sustainable .
there are currently 4@@ 03 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management also assured analy@@ sts and the media that the programme was on schedule .
“ the test aircraft has remained on the ground no longer than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft ’ s stand was subject to ground tests and software updates .
each manufacturer is planning differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to add a revision period , which we did .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining one shortly afterwards , it was said by the company side .
yet analy@@ sts remain ske@@ p@@ tical about whether the first customer to fly a c@@ series aircraft twelve months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it is checking the planning for commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even if you seem to be in line with bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing will be postpon@@ ed to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 c@@ ents per share of $ 17@@ 2 million , or $ 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted ear@@ nings per share remain un@@ changed for 9 c@@ ents .
sales decreas@@ ed slightly , and fell from 4.@@ 2 billion dollars to 4.@@ 1 billion dollars .
analy@@ sts had a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars , according to th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aero@@ space sector was 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion dollars on 30 september , and was un@@ changed compared to 31 december .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within the scope of our specifications , but the low order in@@ take and overall market conditions were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
sales in the aero@@ space sector fell by 13 percent to $ 2 billion .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector rose by just under 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was $ 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on september 30 , and thus slightly increased compared to december 31 .
the profit mar@@ gin in the area of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .
according to the management , new requirements will be set for the fourth quarter .
in the after@@ no@@ ons of trading on thursday , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s share dec@@ lined by 8.@@ 5 % , and stood at 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after it was also announced that the google finance board changed pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte .
the braz@@ ili@@ an emb@@ ra@@ er sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er of the clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , reported a 10 % drop in quar@@ ter@@ ly profit on thursday .
usa : sho@@ ts at los angel@@ es airport
an unknown person left the city on friday morning at the la@@ x airport sho@@ ts .
while the airport management via the short message service t@@ wit@@ ter said that the sho@@ o@@ ter was in cust@@ o@@ dy , the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; , the man was dead .
a security man was also killed .
media also reported several in@@ ju@@ red .
us president bar@@ ack obama is constantly being informed of the situation , said the white house spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in terminal 3 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses said they had a sho@@ o@@ ter with a gun seen in one of the departure h@@ alls , as several media reported .
a travell@@ er told the station c@@ n@@ n that many people had been looking for protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers would have cri@@ ed and children we@@ pt .
the waiting may have pan@@ ic@@ ked , many of them were hi@@ ding behind chairs for fear .
he heard two sho@@ ts , says a travell@@ er of the &quot; los angel@@ es times &quot; .
a security agency employee ts@@ a suffered a sho@@ oting in@@ jury at the foot .
the scene was &quot; like in a movie &quot; .
after that , he himself was brought into a security area , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should have fallen close to a safety control area .
airport building ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
on television scre@@ ens , we saw the numerous hospit@@ als and police cars in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people have been taken out of the building into safety .
users of t@@ wit@@ ter have taken photos of a special mission command and a ri@@ f@@ le lying on the ground .
as the airport management told us via t@@ wit@@ ter , the incident began at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( local time ) .
the access roads were closed , which , according to c@@ n@@ n , resulted in long back@@ -@@ fires .
except land@@ ings , air traffic was tempor@@ arily stopped , it was said .
however , several aircraft were also observed on c@@ n@@ n at the start .
terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller us airlines .
the la@@ x airport of los angel@@ es is one of the largest airports in the united states .
co@@ ca@@ in@@ - dependent law@@ yer who was a drug bo@@ ss who war@@ ned against police investigations must be imprison@@ ed .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information on the under@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further .
the law@@ yer was afraid that his secret drug ad@@ diction could come to light .
he was appointed by the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal def@@ en@@ der , who has to war@@ n a drug bar@@ on of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug ad@@ diction could be exposed , was sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , provided sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information on its investigations into its activities in drug trafficking after being threatened by its own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the “ first-@@ class ” advoc@@ ate , with the sp@@ it@@ ze of “ bas@@ h ” , was elected in his house in 2011 , after the scar@@ bor@@ ou@@ gh police had supervis@@ ed the prosecu@@ tion he had in a prison .
officials wat@@ ched scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) ko@@ k@@ ain hit three bags at the law@@ yer &apos;s house in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , deli@@ veries to the police while they were in the dining room with wal@@ ts@@ kam@@ mer .
the investigations revealed that d@@ it@@ ta regularly uses class a drugs after the tests had left trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his letter ta@@ p and on credit cards .
for a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he attemp@@ ted to in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ate un@@ authorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then investig@@ ated by the police in a major trial of the her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine sear@@ ches of 1.5 million p@@ ounds of house and 200 000 p@@ ounds of cash .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information to the crimin@@ als because he fe@@ ared that his drug ad@@ diction could become public .
today d@@ it@@ ta , who is responsible for the firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was awarded the li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week trial in two charges for dis@@ ability .
he gave the co@@ ca@@ ine ownership in an earlier survey .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police had been involved in their investigation of scar@@ bor@@ ough and found that he had been in regular telephone contact with di@@ tt@@ a in february 2011 .
two investig@@ ators followed the susp@@ ect and saw how he could return to d@@ it@@ ta ’ s home and ex@@ pose drugs with a pur@@ ity of 60 % in a black golf g@@ love under the du@@ st@@ b@@ in of the wal@@ l ton@@ ne .
shortly after he delivered the drugs , scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly tele@@ ph@@ oned with d@@ it@@ ta , who was at dinner in the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers football sta@@ dium in e@@ wood park .
the law@@ yer returned home , took the drugs and then nine messages were received between the two .
in court , d@@ it@@ ta was announced as a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after a number of class a drugs tests were carried out in his hair , his wal@@ let and his credit cards .
d@@ it@@ ta was later arrested but with@@ dre@@ w from taking co@@ ca@@ ine and said he had to deal with the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er because he had served as a client , claim@@ ing that he was engaged in their discussion .
during his arrest d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to buy a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was given a hair sample .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he stated that he was running an office and clients would be required to leave his home because of legal matters .
it was announced in court that he was a key player in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , and he had informed us of what the investig@@ ators knew about them .
prosecu@@ tor anne wh@@ y@@ te said : ‘ a law@@ yer should know better than anyone else that you cannot break the law ’ .
d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he has been too much involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who supplies his law@@ yer with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advoc@@ ate of these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he has been as much respon@@ sive to police investigations as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has brought his profes@@ sion into dis@@ repu@@ te .
he was too close to certain clients , especially scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta dis@@ missed any mis@@ conduct and claimed : “ if i were a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , which i am not , and information to scar@@ bor@@ ough would be passed on , i would not wait for 15 hours , but 15 hours . ”
but after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said by the police in lan@@ cas@@ hire : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta took the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal at the moment he began to catch drugs .
his co@@ ca@@ ine dependence resulted in a ho@@ p@@ eless compromise and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime , who commission@@ ed him to provide valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the fac@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organized crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hire conducted the investigation against d@@ it@@ ta , which also led to a convic@@ tion in three cases on account of the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and the dis@@ ability of justice .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to court .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he was con@@ spir@@ ing to become a her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine , and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is trade .
thir@@ ty-@@ five other people involved in the drug trade have been sent@@ enced to total sent@@ ences of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
d@@ it@@ ta published a section of questions and answers on its website , in which he stated that his dream job was to act as a law@@ yer in death .
the revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebra@@ tions , which took place in the 16@@ 0-@@ year period , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z dun@@ n@@ ingen will host two services with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attrac@@ ted the audience this spring , the rec@@ um@@ b@@ ent will be closed at the end of the anniversary year two services of god .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 during the evening fair in the st. mar@@ tin@@ us@@ kir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , 27 october , from 10 : 15 at the church of st. john .
the so-called deutsche mes@@ se , which is the original title , &quot; sing@@ ing for the celebr@@ ation of the holy sacrif@@ ice of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual work of compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert from 18@@ 26 .
the fair is listed in the context of the services , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann had in mind .
under the direction of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is ch@@ ai@@ red by the br@@ ass group of the musi@@ k@@ vere@@ in fro@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism is increasingly turning away confidence
the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 will , for example , have a positive effect on the has@@ l@@ ach ( se ) maritime unity .
there is only one common par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ish counc@@ ils .
at a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies from has@@ l@@ ach , court ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ stein prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese are no longer to be changed , and the par@@ ish counc@@ ils have to make these decisions as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism about the new one is slowly but surely becoming less than confidence .
the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 and concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council were very constructive discussions between the six bodies with the main representatives .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the new guidelines for se@@ af@@ aring units in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese on the basis of a presentation .
after that , the se has@@ l@@ ach as a church community will form a body of public law that is bound up with the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
only a joint par@@ ish council and a foundation council will be set up , in which the pri@@ est will be represented .
at least two elected members are to be represented from each par@@ ish , in the six par@@ ish houses so-called local teams are formed .
in future , their role will be to promote the church &apos;s life in the place .
on the question of the finances of the individual par@@ ish , there was then a considerable need for discussion .
the innovations provide that accum@@ ulated funds in the par@@ ish are to be re@@ tained for the purpose .
the li@@ abilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municip@@ ality .
in view of the large planned investments , which will then be made by all the par@@ ish authorities , there were serious concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only investments were made in projects that were managed by the individual par@@ ish units alone , &quot; has@@ l@@ ach@@ s par@@ ish church council was chairman br@@ o prin@@ z@@ bach .
practical experience with a joint panel for five par@@ ish churches , bar@@ b@@ ar rit@@ ter , chairman of the committee of the department of the soul care unit , described de@@ br@@ ill@@ ant forest neu@@ ried .
in 2006 they set themselves the task of &apos; becoming one , staying five &apos; and finding that it is not that simple .
the bodies of the has@@ l@@ ach soul security unit then set out to discuss the questions on the future composition and size of the joint par@@ ish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work will be further elabor@@ ated and will be presented at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
at the end , the par@@ ish council michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the soul care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f , the electricity is more expensive .
the citizens of p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f must prepare for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stad@@ tw@@ er@@ ke wer@@ ke , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a four-@@ person p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ fer family will pay 70 to 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called e@@ ec lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ ow@@ att@@ -@@ hour .
this lev@@ y is calculated every year in october by the four operators of the large electricity routes .
these figures show the additional costs they will inc@@ ur from the turn of energy , which they will be able to charge by means of a lev@@ y over the price of electricity .
the city works of p@@ f@@ ul@@ l@@ endor@@ f form the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was even expected to have a higher lev@@ y in its forec@@ asts , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reports .
now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .
&quot; we are talking about an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said bi@@ as , where the number is more close to the 2 cent .
light on permanent red : wait for the waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light symbol is broken .
what should we do then - driving red ?
has a person been waiting long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the stutt@@ gart att@@ or@@ ney r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &apos; reasonable &apos; , which can be interpreted on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es that he should stay for at least five minutes before he can assume that the traffic lights are broken .
if you continue the journey despite the red lights , you must be aware that it is not responsible for the accident that caused it .
those who toler@@ ate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , bec@@ ker war@@ ns and refers to a decision by the supreme court ham@@ m .
in the case negotiated , a driver had the traffic lights turned out to be ignored after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a care@@ less red red light violation .
the traffic lights were not broken , but soon after they jum@@ ped onto the green .
he was not allowed to travel because of the special situation - the fine was not .
the municip@@ al council is pleased to have a solid budget .
whenever local counc@@ ils discuss the budget , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster lau@@ gh@@ s well .
the municip@@ al s@@ ack in her@@ d@@ w@@ ang@@ en-@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and the administration no longer knows about debt since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was clearly demonstrated when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget is more or less eur 7.@@ 6 million than planned .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget is also about eur 1.@@ 8 million above the approach .
the sur@@ plus is due , above all , to higher business tax revenues and the local share in income tax .
the asset budget was also well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envis@@ aged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the increased administration budget , &quot; says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as less investment than planned in the 2012 financial year , the reserve supply system is also higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million now .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for their good work .
&quot; you don &apos;t just sha@@ ke a piece of work out of your sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised with regard to the annual accounts .
he and local counc@@ ils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dear .
due to the good financial situation , the municip@@ ality has in the past been able to dispen@@ se with high he@@ ats .
however , according to ger@@ ster , this in turn has already been cut off from the country on many occasions .
for these subsidies from various compens@@ atory stic@@ ks , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and municip@@ alities applying for subsidies must have certain le@@ vi@@ es .
&quot; we have to look at the issue of he@@ be@@ ls , because in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to receive subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter has been a ch@@ or@@ us for 60 years .
with 60 years as a sing@@ er , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter ’ s story is almost twice as long as the man ’ s sing@@ ing club , ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ a , in which he was hon@@ oured sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood in the colours of his men ’ s sing@@ ing club as usual .
after 60 years , sing@@ ing with the now more than loved cho@@ ir still gives him great fun .
wer@@ m@@ ter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he was awarded several awards for his commitment and his loy@@ alty to the club : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al speaker on behalf of the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ en@@ ver@@ band rot@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart , presented him with the award .
his sing@@ ers gave him the certificate of the german ch@@ oral association and a eng@@ ra@@ ved tin plate .
the 3@@ 1st autumn festival was celebrated in the usual way : with the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the song w@@ re@@ ath sal@@ in@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er ’ s department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music association .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen , with mo@@ o@@ dy songs like &quot; in the wine paradise &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , her bro@@ thers &quot; , opened up a new way of life .
her hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter prepared a little stand for her - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .
the men ’ s sing@@ ing club be@@ tra also san@@ g classical cho@@ ir songs like “ j@@ ä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben ” by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , “ far away ” by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song .
the song cr@@ ane salt ste@@ t@@ ten caused a great deal of concern with his mixed cho@@ ir and his group of women - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se gate &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k song &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; by an@@ tos g@@ us in foreign countries , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se language &quot; also att@@ acked :

ken@@ y@@ an press is ou@@ tr@@ aged by controversial media law
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing situation and one may wonder : what is the view of parliament that it will simply abol@@ ish judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was not mentioned in the newspaper , which is not in favour of the draft constitution .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able and we reject it , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director of the capital group , which also includes capital f@@ m , one of the most respected radio stations .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be bi@@ ased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would make ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy damaged .
“ i hope the president will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is effectively taking a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold by means of the new law “ the media ” , whereas ken@@ ya ’ s standard , democracy , and freedom of speech had “ suffered a heavy b@@ low , ” and ran .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at ensuring national security following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west@@ gate shopping centre in september .
the ken@@ y@@ an media attrac@@ ted the authorities ’ an@@ ger because they published foot@@ age of security cameras that showed how the ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ties sent to the scene were supposed to be the luxury shopping centre .
david ki@@ ma@@ i@@ y@@ o , the head of police , respon@@ ded by or@@ dering two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the sub@@ po@@ ena was not released after an out@@ cr@@ y from the media .
under the new law , media houses can be pun@@ ished with a fine of up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings , and individual journalists with up to one million , and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to se@@ ize the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even a single pun@@ ishment can push most radio stations into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy . ”
in addition , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on what it calls the “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” of ken@@ ya .
if you silence the media , politicians could do with imp@@ unity whatever they like .
“ nobody will ever know , ” mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u wrote , a journ@@ alist at the nation that has regarded the ken@@ y@@ an media as a decisive factor in public control .
“ if politicians leave themselves alone , they will lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and return to the era of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have already taken public trouble .
in may , they voted to re@@ vo@@ ke the cuts imposed by the national compensation commission , and continued their def@@ enc@@ eless sal@@ aries of around 5@@ 3@@ 2@@ ,000 sch@@ illing .
bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim : a dream is true for the f@@ c
the importance of the city and the football club was lost by the official in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation of the artificial tur@@ f sports ground despite the cold weather and the rain .
a more pleasant celebr@@ ation was probably everyone &apos;s wish last saturday , but peter did not want to play with it .
so all those who did not have um@@ bre@@ lla or those who did not have one for some reason could not keep it .
this was a very important step for musicians who fr@@ amed the festival act , as did many speakers .
we@@ t , therefore , the f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of ful@@ filling a dream .
his thanks were due to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who has been very committed to implementing the project , the municip@@ al council , the companies involved and members of the association , who have taken part .
here , in particular , lo@@ th@@ ar her@@ o , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f .
the reti@@ red , who were standing , laid 400 square meters of pav@@ ement stones for the new ways .
this remarkable volunte@@ er commitment was also appreciated by land@@ tag@@ s@@ m@@ ate kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach .
other gre@@ etings were addressed to the municip@@ al sports committee hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chair of the south ba@@ den football association , k@@ ino k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r from the planning office , the german football office .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather conditions were a major factor in the early and autumn la@@ wn , so that it could not be played .
15 years ago , the first consideration of the problem was to start building a third place at the football club grounds or at the real school at sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both were rejected again .
six years ago , thought was given to setting up an artificial tur@@ f sports ground , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were made two years ago , when the f@@ c moved the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be into in@@ herit@@ ance le@@ ase , a cost share of eur 100 000 for the construction of the place and the country received funding of eur 10@@ 4 000 tr@@ il@@ lion .
the municip@@ al council decided to take over the remaining 3@@ 56 000 euros in october 2012 at the total cost of eur 5@@ 60 000 , summar@@ ised k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p .
the construction of the 68 times 10@@ 8 meters high artificial tur@@ f was started on 4 june .
during the construction phase , which las@@ ted for more than three months , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of earth were dis@@ charged , half of which were used for the creation of a dir@@ t bike track .

among other things , it is about direct democracy , bri@@ ber@@ y of members and the federal police .
this morning , the migration and integration working group also wanted to continue its work .
this should include the issue of dual citizenship , on which both sides have conflic@@ ting ideas .
the sp@@ d wants to avoid the pressure on immi@@ grant children born in germany to choose one - the union re@@ jects a double pass@@ port .
on transport , which was not on the agenda this friday , the sp@@ d under@@ lined its &apos; no &apos; to a request from the c@@ su for a car tol@@ l .
a vig@@ net@@ te is a &quot; flat rate for the multi@@ plic@@ ity and thus environmentally counter@@ productive &quot; , said the sp@@ d negoti@@ ator for transport , fl@@ ori@@ an pron@@ old , in a letter to his group .
there was a risk of ev@@ asion on rural roads , which are already priorities for accidents .
the introduction of a tol@@ l for all cars would also be a first step from the point of view of pron@@ ol@@ ds .
&quot; there is a danger that compensation for german soldiers will be deleted at a later stage , &quot; he said .

vienna airport makes passenger calls from the airport .
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
the new york times will be a great success .
a large proportion of the lou@@ d@@ speaker through@@ put is thus dro@@ pped - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .
like our speaker , peter kle@@ em@@ ann , announced to radio vienna , vienna airport is following the lead by setting up announ@@ c@@ ements concerning individuals .
for example , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i are already ref@@ using to make the noise .
by elimin@@ ating these through@@ put , on average , around 200 personal calls from the lou@@ d@@ speakers every day will sound more cal@@ mly at the airport in the future .
&quot; experience has shown that these individual pron@@ oun@@ c@@ ements have been relatively un@@ noticed , but at the same time all other information on changed flight times or depar@@ tures is dro@@ pped here , &quot; kle@@ em@@ ann said in his interview .

ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
pu@@ red to@@ f@@ u with vege@@ table cre@@ am , for example , is a quar@@ k@@ ling substitu@@ te .
the other is the world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the german vege@@ t@@ arian her@@ b is preparing a series of vege@@ t@@ arian alternatives on the occasion of world ve@@ gan day on november 1 :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t let replace with so@@ y@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .
instead of milk , so@@ y , o@@ ven , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk can be used .
re@@ vol@@ ving plant cre@@ am substitu@@ tes traditional wh@@ ist@@ le cre@@ am .
there are also vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half a crus@@ hed , mature ban@@ ana , for example , can be used to replace an eg@@ g as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of gr@@ in@@ ded lin@@ en plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable for this .
the d@@ ough is loc@@ ked instead of eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of a te@@ as@@ po@@ on of ba@@ king pow@@ der , a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of meal th@@ ick@@ ness and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k to@@ f@@ u can also achieve this purpose .
according to ve@@ b@@ u , some 800 000 people currently feed ve@@ gan in germany , i.e. purely vege@@ table .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess new york
on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um students met the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight we went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which is the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , on foot .
the view of the world famous sky@@ line was already fascinating , which was the perfect place to enjoy the evening light .
the time was postpon@@ ed , the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours , but fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully the s@@ log@@ an &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; was decided on the day at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached by a fer@@ ry on the second day and could be kno@@ c@@ ked down on foot .
then it was about the financial center around wall street to comm@@ em@@ or@@ ate september 11 .
on the third day , the students could enjoy a view of the emp@@ ire valley from the 3@@ 73 meter high viewing platform .
after that , the hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of new york ’ s streets went through the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to sit down in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the world ’ s daily life at we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , the new year will be held on the nam@@ e-@@ day of saint hu@@ ber@@ tus in the par@@ ish church of st. mari@@ en at h@@ ul@@ s@@ ber@@ g@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was , according to leg@@ end , a rather ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n b@@ low@@ ing group of the hun@@ ting thir@@ ds west@@ ph@@ alia , head@@ ed by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , is musi@@ cally involved in par@@ for@@ ce@@ hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od es ) .
the br@@ ass wear hor@@ se@@ -@@ wear because they mainly wear hor@@ se@@ -@@ drawn carri@@ ers , horses and dog owners during to@@ w hun@@ ts .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ sch@@ la@@ g sh@@ ines with a new café .
one that invi@@ tes you to stay and re@@ treat .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
according to the le@@ x@@ icon , dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is a psycho@@ logical phenomenon that expres@@ ses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in case of a visit to the café at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve , the district town , in sight , to the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al , it does not have to remain with pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
after all , the café with its beautiful name is aimed at precisely that : a real stay not only in thought but also in hand@@ -@@ fe@@ ast to be experienced again and again .
because it &apos;s fun and just beautiful .
a look into the inner life of op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first sight .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern but not cool café ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
the team will p@@ amp@@ er you with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a variety of coffee or cock@@ tail options .
there is also a delicious ca@@ ke or individually occupied fresh bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already settled in the hotel before the opening of the beautiful café at op@@ sch@@ t as a gastronom@@ ic restaurant : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they ran the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from the move to kle@@ ve to the op@@ sch@@ t , the friendly caf@@ e lovers hope to have more audience .
the university of applied sciences is one of the most important institutions of the university of applied sciences .
&quot; although we do not have a specific target group , &quot; dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ ses .
the two young students here want to address as much as senior citizens and all ages in between .
speaking of café lovers .
the friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoy@@ ment .
enjoy the frag@@ rant hot bre@@ w in various vari@@ ations .
expres@@ so@@ fan
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more of an expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ el@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino tr@@ in@@ ker .
&quot; a bag@@ u@@ ette on this - that is my thing &quot; , she be@@ tr@@ ays the n@@ r@@ z .
two events were also held in the bright café .
in other words , one thing .
the port festival was held outside - the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ ab@@ end .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps that is another reason why dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a pron@@ oun@@ ced fan of event even@@ ings : &quot; you can &apos;t make everyone happy &quot; .
and with an event i will only address those who are interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as low as possible &quot; .
the term is : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also means reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming more and more a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile , is becoming a very popular destination .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ ver , the guests from near and far and the students who enjoy the ga@@ stro@@ m@@ ile and thus also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u .

a day of thanks to the m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker
it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation festival of the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; which was invited this year and attrac@@ ted 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves .
the restaurant wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g in din@@ ker was founded in the club restaurant in din@@ ker .
tradi@@ tionally , the festival of foundations is always the appropriate festival for hon@@ ours .
the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; was a pleasure for writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er .
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but also made some la@@ p for us , for which we thank you very much , &quot; says the ch@@ or@@ us er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of activity bott@@ len@@ ec@@ ks were awarded to the ch@@ oral director di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 participants , followed by the hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st ri@@ er-@@ pi@@ er-@@ pi@@ er-@@ pi@@ er-@@ her@@ bert .

the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets his regular cho@@ ir sam@@ ples every tuesday at 7.@@ 45 pm in the club club .

un announ@@ ces new targets in the fight against poverty
the united nations is now starting to work on a number of new objectives , which will enable the millennium development goals on poverty announced twelve years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in the push for “ sustainable development goals ” that will replace the 20@@ 15 millennium .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which was adopted by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to initi@@ ate a process that will enable universal , sustainable development goals to be agreed , ” he said .
“ these goals will be based on our progress from the millennium development goals and will be an integral part of the post-@@ 20@@ 15 development framework .
i will spare no effort in re@@ member@@ ing the mandate given to me by the member states to fulfil our vision of sustainable development objectives , based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four days , the hand@@ ball upper lig@@ ist still has a good mo@@ od .
this is what co@@ ach tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon leaves no doubt at all .
everyone is still fully motivated about the matter .
however , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how such a victory tas@@ tes , &quot; mal@@ mon exp@@ ects a success experience from his team .
even if the third league reserve from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k has not yet pul@@ led out trees , mal@@ mon has already war@@ ned against the time spent in advance .
many players i have trained myself in the a-@@ youth .
therefore , you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach .
&quot; it is also important to see if there is still some rein@@ for@@ cement from the first , &quot; the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach points out .
to return to the b@@ are track of success , the mal@@ mon@@ -@@ team must be more flexible than the previous performances .
above all , in the coverage work and in the swit@@ ching game , it was a huge success .
recovery of opportunities must definitely be improved .
therefore , i hope that my players will finally have their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential figures and the world ’ s most influ@@ ential figures .
thousands of people gathered in the center of ma@@ pu@@ to under the al@@ ert eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder of state and first president of moz@@ ambi@@ que to build peace calls in a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
in fear of the country ’ s future , she has turned her business clothes against a t-@@ shir@@ t with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and has moved on to the independence square of the capital on thursday .
for two weeks now , there have been reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o almost daily , which have been one of the worst batt@@ les since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially led by white r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by apar@@ the@@ id south africa ’ s government , in an effort to strengthen the country ’ s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts believe that it is unlikely to return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have left foreign investors and loc@@ als wor@@ ried .
the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy is at stake , because disco@@ vering huge depos@@ its of gas off the coast and coal depos@@ its in the nor@@ th@@ west could generate more than $ 50 billion of investment from firms like rio tin@@ to , brazil .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , since 197@@ 5 the dominant force , and ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government has pro@@ vo@@ ked the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by inv@@ iting its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional strong@@ hold of ren@@ am@@ os , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when government troops ren@@ am@@ o bases att@@ acked and tried to attack af@@ on@@ so d@@ h@@ l@@ ak@@ ama .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to play down concerns about inst@@ ability .
compared to af@@ p , the french news agency , on wednesday , he said that dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama had been seen as a “ lo@@ ser ” who “ had to use all his remaining forces to prove that he was not doing so .
both fre@@ li@@ mo and ren@@ am@@ o stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was quo@@ ted in the words that ren@@ am@@ o is aband@@ oning the 1992 peace agreement .
he said to the ft that he meant that fre@@ li@@ mo no longer respects the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations and to do so seriously , ” ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions caused by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adults here men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who are cl@@ ash@@ ing heads , ” says joseph h@@ ann@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ ambi@@ que .
none of them is good at negotiating , and none is prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pus@@ hing for electoral reform , has already said that she will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have described the use of force as an attempt by a si@@ ck@@ ening movement to impose conc@@ essions and financial advantages on the government .
ren@@ am@@ o ’ s electoral success has been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , the movi@@ men@@ to demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tic@@ o de mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) , founded by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , is likely to improve .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due to end next year ’ s second term – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s capacity is , but it has not stopped un@@ sett@@ ling attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-@@ south link .
most of the batt@@ les took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which is a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but in which be@@ ira is located , the port , the mining companies like rio ext@@ into and val@@ le .
in june , rio inter@@ rup@@ ted the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o announced an attack on the track .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a rep@@ lied cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted “ to war@@ n the international community that things are not going well in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has fu@@ el@@ ed more fru@@ stration with the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people have been concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo are not interested , they just want peace and us@@ able roads , ” he said .
children should regard my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ models of life , ” says an author .
the stories of th@@ or showed that “ brut@@ al force has no chance against cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ ends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .
but many of the my@@ ths are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and sometimes too dir@@ ty to be taught at schools .
“ i find it wonderful that in america my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that authors and teachers who have “ exc@@ es@@ sively di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic , ” children would “ switch off completely , ” because in enter@@ taining stories , the messages would “ sub@@ ver@@ t ” .
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , the be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on and the author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of no@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k valley , said : “ you can follow certain intentions .
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is in the need to create hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy end , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
this must be under@@ stated , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
han@@ s@@ jac@@ o@@ b is again going to fre@@ i@@ hof
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b obtained his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years were alive at the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were delighted with the extremely tw@@ ili@@ ght scene play .
from the arrival to the awar@@ ding of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship , to his death , script writer and han@@ s@@ jac@@ o@@ b actor alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k had designed an enter@@ taining piece , which was directed by the people of ne@@ pal .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience as spo@@ kes@@ man through the ten different scenes , explained contex@@ ts and brid@@ ged jum@@ ps of time from youth to the appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b came home to his kin@@ der@@ him@@ me@@ l , to his fre@@ i@@ hof .
and then began the scene game in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again played in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ l as the great son of the city .
he was driving with the two sp@@ än@@ ner and &quot; black forest fo@@ xes &quot; by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ len@@ bach .
he was received with a lot of applause not only by the audience , but his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine also welcomed him .
bil@@ ly sum@@ -@@ her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to be part of the si@@ ster &apos;s role and gave her a voice in m@@ im@@ ics and ge@@ st@@ ures of mon@@ strous life .
the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach farm band played selected music pieces and run@@ es out the re@@ hear@@ s@@ als between the various play scenes .
in order to give honour to the lord &apos;s dignity , has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler gave himself the honour to represent the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent , together with a part of the council .
the tri@@ -@@ k@@ ings , han@@ s@@ jac@@ o@@ b and the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ al sing@@ ers then made the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , i will return youth mem@@ ories to my own tri@@ enni@@ al . &quot;
with her song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the audience at the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the con@@ gre@@ gation had been expressed at han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , as were his concerns about the exc@@ esses in agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind his grave cha@@ pel at the fire near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his rest place .
&quot; a re@@ st@@ less spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home fore@@ ver , &quot; it said at the end of the scene play .
a lot of applause and many pra@@ ising words were given by the audience for the performance .
bas@@ ket@@ ball : the nec@@ k@@ ar giant &apos;s hope is growing .
the chan@@ ces of remaining in league of the sport@@ y des@@ c@@ ended lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ ers have increased .

&quot; we will not participate in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said ex@@ -@@ national player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been the concept for a professional club in the han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
a first bre@@ a@@ thing was not heard from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; we did not deal with the wil@@ d@@ card procedure until it was established that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf would not receive a licence , &quot; said nec@@ kar@@ -@@ ri@@ es@@ en-@@ bo@@ ss alexander re@@ il of our newspaper .
until 23 may , as@@ cent d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf bas@@ ket can submit documents to the arbitr@@ ation court and demonstrate his economic su@@ it@@ ability for bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a .

the arbitr@@ ation court is the last instance .

snow@@ den may also be able to say russian
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den may be in the late us case in his russian asylum as well .
representatives of the federal public prosecu@@ tor ’ s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 year old in person in russia .

such an issue could be resolved between states , it was said .
snow@@ den &apos;s departure from russia is virtually impossible .
&quot; in this case , he lo@@ ses his refugee status , &quot; the agency quo@@ ted her source .

they are distribu@@ ting the coal coming from the ships to the po@@ le .
the company has several iron at the site in the fire .
besides coal imports , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also uses wind energy logistics .
black sh@@ ines the coal on the sto@@ re@@ front of the di@@ ke .
two massive blue sha@@ ft and re@@ ar load devices are distributed or loaded the coal here as needed .
every movement of the trans@@ shi@@ pment takes a sound warning over the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals are safety and are required by law , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
in the event of un@@ favourable wind , unfortunately , this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north .
he takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures .
he will continue to work on open dialogue with our neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll still has a lot to do in front of the site .
with the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard continues to focus on the coal import of power stations and is one of the major producers in europe in this sector .
thanks to the p@@ an of the front terminal , which is deep@@ ened to 18@@ .@@ 5 metres , ca@@ pe@@ si@@ z@@ e-@@ bul@@ k@@ carri@@ ers can also be manufactured here .
&quot; this year we want to use the 3-@@ million ton brand in the en@@ velo@@ pe &quot; , says sch@@ re@@ ell .
in addition to the e@@ on power station on the ground , the import coal goes to power plants in the interior .
if the g@@ d@@ f su@@ e@@ z power station goes on the net , then well 5 million tonnes of coal imported per year will be realistic .
the three ship lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second transport tape could create up to 10 million .

she was the first to perform in the european royal class and the munich people sold themselves very well for a long time , but were simply not clear enough in the crucial stages .

ben green@@ man : ten years new york com@@ edy festival : the new york com@@ edy festival : the new york city festival : the new york city festival : the new york times .
it could be said that new york city was the birth@@ place of stand@@ -up com@@ edy in america : nearly a hundred years ago , the vari@@ e@@ te@@ artist frank f@@ ay , who was known as conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er at the palace .
over the years , f@@ ays innovation has been expanded , as was the last time at the new york com@@ edy festival .
created and directed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ines , the festival celebra@@ tes its ten@@ -@@ year anniversary this year with more than 60 shows .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began at car@@ ol@@ ines and became more successful until they became too familiar at some point to be in a club , ” said h@@ ir@@ sch .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event , there are performances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , ka@@ thy gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as by “ stand up for her@@ oes ” , an annual musical and com@@ edy event .
the festival also has grown the world of com@@ edy .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who are participating in this year ’ s festival have become familiar with more un@@ conventional ways , such as broad@@ ca@@ sts on smaller television channels like com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was known with a sit@@ com on cable tv ( the ir@@ on@@ ically sli@@ pping fant@@ as@@ y football series &quot; the league &quot; on f@@ x@@ x ) and now has his own ske@@ tch show .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was present at the “ saturday night live ” as well as at “ parks and recre@@ ation ” , although they were most famous for their vir@@ al video series “ mar@@ cel the shell with shoes ” .

from 2005 to 2007 he was performing a tv show entitled “ sit down com@@ edy with david ste@@ in@@ berg ” on tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the middle of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of lar@@ ry ’ s entire work , ” said ste@@ in@@ berg .

dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : young k@@ ills games cham@@ bers with mac@@ he@@ tes and
two children have died in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two 14 and 12 year-@@ old bo@@ ys had invited their victims to go bird hun@@ ting with them .
armed with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they are st@@ inging on tuesday the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old and thro@@ wing the cor@@ pse into a well , the newspaper reported &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; on thursday .
they would then have played football before their homes in a work@@ ing-@@ class district .
the body was thro@@ wn in the next night in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach pun@@ ta del est@@ e .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ old half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger , who took them with them , should say that she was sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the boy .
but when the girl was in front of the police , when the action was taken without men@@ tioning an attack against her , the two bo@@ ys committed the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the older , among other things , called a ri@@ val@@ ry in the football match .
he was tempor@@ arily transformed into a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institution .
p@@ im@@ ps must be j@@ ail@@ ed
it is not possible to do so because of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ p , threat , insul@@ t and dangerous body in@@ jury , that the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z sent@@ enced a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. george to three and a half years in prison .
the former german army soldi@@ er , who was a tur@@ re@@ t after two missions in afghanistan , set up a conf@@ ession in the context of a process agreement .
he has therefore informed women in five cases via internet or telephone contacts , which he has closed down after a few weeks against their will .
he used to break with violence and threats .
the income of women , who have been in some cases for years , for him , has been re@@ tained .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mobile phones and si@@ m cards , he sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ated women ’ s contacts with the outside world .
together with a colleague who medi@@ ated the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the south-@@ west .
there he had some monitoring to control their revenue .
in court , the def@@ end@@ ant claimed that he was suffering from a severe tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues in afghanistan died next to him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had serious doubts about mental re@@ stra@@ int and thus about a limited liability , the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric ill@@ ness was a major conf@@ ession by the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old .
the court did not hear any of the women who were in@@ ju@@ red .
as a k@@ ri@@ po official reported , after a first display , telephone surveillance measures could prevent at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted talks were marked by high aggres@@ sion .
later on , the in@@ ju@@ red would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , in which one of the women on the whole body had discovered blue spots , has not made a statement to this day .
it is &apos; a completely broken person@@ ality &apos; , which perpe@@ tu@@ ates violence and exploitation in this profes@@ sion as normal .
the def@@ end@@ ant regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he had dis@@ solved himself from these cir@@ cles and he wanted to lead a normal life after de@@ tention &quot; , he said .
oil prices continue to rise to up to usd 96 per bar@@ re@@ l
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after wor@@ ries about a high supply over@@ shadow a report that the ener@@ g@@ y-@@ un@@ friendly manufacturing sector in china is growing .
the reference cru@@ de oil variety for deli@@ veries in december was available in electronic commerce at the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange in europe at a rate of 14 c@@ ents to usd 9@@ 6.@@ 24 per bar@@ re@@ l .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which meant a 5.@@ 8 % fall in prices in october .
the large range of cru@@ de oil has been bur@@ den@@ ed by prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer had been reduced by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over five weeks , the offer had increased by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday , there were indic@@ ations of greater demand through two reports of an increase in activity in chinese manufacturing .
this suggests continued economic recovery in china , whose growth is set to reach 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , after a decline in the previous quarter at the lowest since two decades .

court bloc@@ ked decision on the n@@ y@@ p@@ d ’ s stop and fr@@ is@@ k directive
a federal appe@@ als court in the us bloc@@ ked the order of a judge on thursday to make changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge sh@@ ira sch@@ u@@ ed@@ lin &apos;s decisions would be suspended until a decision was taken on the appeal of the city .
the judge jud@@ ged in august that the city vio@@ lated the constitution with the way in which the program for the stop and stop ques@@ tioning of persons was implemented .
the city laid appeal against its assessment and the ordered re@@ medi@@ al measures , including the decision to set up a surveillance office that would help the police in amending its directive and the relevant training program .
the court of appeal heard on tuesday the arguments for the requested suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge must dis@@ miss the case , since she has not yet ratified the code of conduct for us jud@@ ges , by speci@@ fying that a judge may have the impression of par@@ tis@@ an@@ ship ;
the judge had rul@@ ed that police officers in@@ ju@@ red the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were deliber@@ ately black and latin american men with the st@@ alling code .
she appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes , including reforms of directives , training and service supervision , and set up a pilot programme with bodies we@@ aring cameras in neighbor@@ ho@@ ods where the most controls were carried out .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of persons who have been dis@@ missed after police control .
an oral negotiation to ap@@ point the city is planned after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fresh tac@@ tics have been used by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded checks during the term of the non-@@ par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg rose to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 30 in 2011 , most of which were in 2011 .
in 2004 , four men , who belong@@ ed to all minorities , were brought to justice , which became a collective action .
ad@@ voca@@ tes of changes to the non-@@ stop and fr@@ is@@ k program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and more effective police force , as well as influ@@ encing the way others operate .
oppon@@ ents believe that the changes would d@@ amp@@ en the mor@@ als of the police , but not crime ; they would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to lose thousands of jobs in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet received the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice of constitu@@ tionally speaking , but only the type of implementation of the controls by the non-@@ y@@ p@@ d .

with this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom , the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon , the t@@ enth anniversary of the association , which has already achieved considerable success , was celebrated .
the first chairman , mr hen@@ ne , reported exten@@ sively on the work of the association .
he was himself in maur@@ it@@ ania for the first time in 2004 at the ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k-@@ z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
as a result , another cooperation developed , and gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne performed numerous operations on the spot during several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the inser@@ ts were shown on a large screen , so that guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned .
the club ’ s deser@@ t vehicle has also been shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , had made the proposal to equi@@ p this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and now plans to work as an advisory role at the association according to hen@@ ne .
in 2008 , zim@@ mer@@ e@@ i sch@@ le@@ e@@ h from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n won the hospital in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , an mis@@ ery district on the edge of the capital - hon@@ or@@ ary .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mo@@ ther@@ -@@ child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
especially interesting in times when the birth clin@@ ic in n@@ ag@@ old is to be wea@@ thered .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practi@@ tion@@ er , according to hen@@ ne , for example , de-@@ le@@ ver@@ aging against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the political un@@ rest in the country has prevented the number of jour@@ ne@@ ys that were planned , but many medical practi@@ tion@@ ers came to germany to p@@ ray in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers are regularly sent to africa with material , such as medical devices , medicines , association material , hospital beds and gl@@ asses .
mi@@ tin@@ i@@ ti@@ ator han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself supplied plenty of local color@@ ation by making it from maur@@ it@@ ania from the mo@@ to@@ g@@ p mer@@ ce@@ des@@ -@@ vehicles converted to a mobile go@@ at@@ stable .
when his personal mo@@ tives were ci@@ ted as being young me@@ p , he was working in the area of aud@@ iting .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help afric@@ ans control a budget through the people .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also stressed that global economic activity also demands human love .
nor should it be forgotten that africa is closer than some think .
from gran can@@ aria it is not far to africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used telephone h@@ acking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son alle@@ ge@@ dly put &quot; telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation &quot; in an attempt to give a false tip about an aff@@ air of the then interior minister charles clar@@ ke .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c told the court in the old b@@ ail@@ ey that news of the world had a false rum@@ or in may 2005 that clar@@ ke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ er . ”
the newspaper commission@@ ed gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire , a private detec@@ tive , to release pa@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , and followed them , but cou@@ l@@ son also called them and left messages .
“ according to the public prosecu@@ tor ’ s office , cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the no@@ tw@@ a , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to ta@@ p it in fresh de@@ ed , but a story that people . ”
he said that no@@ tw@@ w use three methods to investi@@ ga@@ tively research stories : telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he obviously knows about the second , the monitoring , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone h@@ acking ?
he is argu@@ ing about this , but we say , ‘ and whether he knew about it ’ .
rum@@ ors of an aff@@ air with clar@@ kes were first published by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial of no@@ tw@@ w , a source that was sex@@ ually interested in pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , was said : “ don ’ t waste your time .
a volume with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the detec@@ tive &apos;s computer on which pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster were stored as &quot; projects &quot; .
in the time that research was conducted , the grand@@ parents of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by received anonymous calls , in which they were asked for information about them , ed@@ is explained .
meanwhile , the former chief porter ne@@ ville thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former re@@ porter of j@@ ames we@@ at@@ er@@ up over@@ saw the movements of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her with a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which i would like to talk about with charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important person@@ alities , such as former interior minister david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
on thursday , the jur@@ ies heard that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t was sent@@ enced to a married woman for an aff@@ air , when he himself was charged with the co-@@ accused re@@ be@@ ka@@ h bro@@ o@@ ks .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks argue that they have con@@ spir@@ acy to inter@@ f@@ ere with others , telephone calls between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 .
mul@@ ca@@ ire , thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and wea@@ ther@@ up have added the telephone h@@ acking .
in protest against the planned imperi@@ al tax , french football will indeed be the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a conciliation meeting will end without result .
in the conflict over the imperi@@ al tax , the government and professional football in france have been re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to enter a dead@@ lock after a failed conciliation meeting .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de , although he received a gre@@ e@@ ting at the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , and heard their complaints .
he refused to remove football from the planned 75 % limit on the amount of money he had paid out .
the other side remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of november will now be drag@@ ged out , the head of the professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel , with him .
the new york times , which will take place between 29 november and 2 december , are therefore out of date .
ch@@ ick@@ en : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in the planning process early on &quot; , may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler opened the citizens &apos; information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ chin@@ gen .
about 80 participants had come to the municip@@ al hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring ideas .
he@@ iss@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municip@@ al council &quot; .
the floo@@ ding that er@@ up@@ ted on 15 may 2009 was a dramatic and un@@ prepared event , which raised the question of protection for the future .
a river area survey was conducted with the neighbouring municip@@ ality of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which is now the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many built land as possible is the goal &quot; , says h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
the design of the protection against a weather service according to german weather service is based on the statistical data of expected floo@@ ds every 100 years .
climate change is being taken into account by a 15 % sur@@ charge .
this is achieved in specialist cir@@ cles by the term &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es that caused considerable damage in ge@@ chin@@ en in 2009 were equivalent to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year-@@ old flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , &quot; says h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
to protect the h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , approximately four million euros must be invested in ge@@ chin@@ en , with the municip@@ ality receiving state aid of around 70 percent .
but chi@@ ef@@ tains pointed out that there is only support if an overall concept is implemented .
the community must have the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
at best , 20@@ 16 can begin to implement .
among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the municip@@ al council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures in the influ@@ x of the river ir@@ m from the tri@@ bal valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to submit their requests .
among other things , it was ques@@ tioned why more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int bas@@ ins are not planned to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the engine@@ er of the engineering office of the forest and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all presented measures in order to achieve the sum .
moreover , one should be held the most econom@@ ical solution to find , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
there was dis@@ pleasure among al@@ t@@ or@@ ts &apos; residents , who were under a heavy load even during normal ra@@ inf@@ all .
the problem is well known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .
however , chi@@ ef@@ tains pointed out that the channel system directives are different from those for flo@@ od prevention , and that this should not be mixed .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to design the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation could be toler@@ ated .
the se@@ wage channels to be larger would dev@@ our millions .
after the collapse
on the state road 44 near reven@@ s@@ dorf , two drivers are driving on the early friday afternoon in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately closed the street completely , but at first it could say little about the accident .
however , there are various testi@@ mon@@ ies that should be evalu@@ ated first .
it is a fact that the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old ste@@ ering officer of a v@@ w golf was driving towards reven@@ s@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f came with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cl@@ ash@@ ed together , and the woman was so heavily tr@@ app@@ ed that the fire bri@@ g@@ ade needed bare@@ ly half an hour to get them out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the cause of the accident was initially un@@ clear .
both failed came to nearby hospit@@ als .
the track was closed for about two hours .
one could call it the do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky of the us .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d-@@ see@@ ker , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories also have something ser@@ ial .
the relationship in the ou@@ ter world is ast@@ on@@ ishing : the g@@ listening eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , like f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre as founder and apo@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul , one reads phili@@ p k. dic@@ k as an american pro@@ ph@@ et .
some tit@@ les have been published by he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g , which produced ha@@ ff@@ man@@ s cas@@ set@@ tes with the 1@@ 18 stories , selling two-@@ thous@@ and@@ ths .
dic@@ k explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technological progress , cou@@ pled with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , in@@ san@@ e security , and the belief that it is selected .
dic@@ k had a wealth of experience in the go@@ d. his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has already cap@@ tured early that the computers are div@@ ini@@ ties .
he wrote a computer the@@ ology and asked what a person would be different from a machine that cre@@ ator had from his creature .
this is the bl@@ ade run@@ ner problem .
killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been fil@@ med by film directors such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 195@@ 6 , it ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ al .
the principle of &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-@@ crime &apos; , that is , what is now more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ ks world , which is app@@ alling to our own , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are interven@@ ing .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not vio@@ lated any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we &apos;ll s@@ na@@ p us before you can commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious crimin@@ als , for this we have a fl@@ yer full of pes@@ u@@ do crimin@@ als &quot; .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dic@@ k &apos;s nar@@ ra@@ tive acts as the blue@@ print for anti-@@ terrorism laws and the n@@ sa &apos;s e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ ks story is not over yet .
the chief of police compla@@ ins that there is no longer any separation of powers , that the military controls everyday life - and what remains of the state .
then the supervis@@ or will be supervis@@ ed and convic@@ ted of a future crime .
the system ro@@ ta@@ tes through .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it inv@@ ents its own pre@@ conditions .
does not only accept mistakes and sacrif@@ ices , but buil@@ ds on them .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k reads dic@@ k , and always means coming closer to the truth .
late h@@ its around mer@@ kel in russia
the former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den may be in the late us case for chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel to address his russian asylum as well .
representatives of the german law@@ yer could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30 year old in russia personally , the agency inter@@ fax reported .
before that , the federal green member han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le was the first german politici@@ an to meet snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to discuss the aff@@ air with him .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations reinforce par@@ an@@ o@@ ia of companies because of state surveillance
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep over the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , the capital of germany .
on the instructions of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal security service , he should take photographs of the us foreign office ’ s roof , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to prove the presence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of words between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , again insi@@ sted in september that the us had no foreign s@@ cor@@ ing options , “ to protect the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies in the us on behalf of us companies .
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , who became the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , with the publication of his f@@ ill@@ er hor@@ n to us surveillance secre@@ ts , european governments and entreprene@@ urs have become un@@ aware of the fact that they are no longer taking the word .
reports that the us national security agency has been sup@@ plying the braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ b@@ as and ga@@ thering data from american cl@@ oud providers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , have been reported by the company ’ s par@@ an@@ o@@ id authorities .
the bar@@ re@@ l over@@ flow@@ ed with the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was inter@@ rup@@ ted , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then management companies are certainly potential targets .
snow@@ den has already demonstrated the close cooperation between us intelligence services and companies in a transparent way .
i believe that it is con@@ cei@@ vable that these data will be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver green , president of bit@@ mi , the small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as much risk as china when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , a survey that was conducted by the advis@@ or company ey in july .
snow@@ den documents le@@ ak@@ ed have not shown any evidence that the us has cut the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on its own firms .
politicians have expressed their concern that certain it and internet opportunities are lacking in the eu and that they should reduce their dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
in the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly re@@ open them ...
“ this is not working , ” says h@@ as@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of the german software producer sap .
if we had wanted a strong european it industry , we would not have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
however , scope and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the information provided by the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations have not helped firms to sho@@ ck , which previously had the largest sp@@ y ri@@ g in china .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is changing a lot because european business leaders are more aware that in the us , data from the legal juris@@ pru@@ dence is subject to and potentially end@@ ange@@ red .
according to a report published by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has announced that it has not yet received any notice of the data mining activities in the united states .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty ceo of sap , says : “ we are seeing a new question of customers that it was not yet a year ago – it is : where are my data stored and can guarantee them physi@@ cally ?
many german corporate leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew .
it is no surprise that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundament@@ ally by the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying us on the commercial and industrial levels , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate governance usually does not bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures that have been taken , because that gives att@@ ack@@ ers advantages .
large companies have long since introduced the idea that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or un@@ guar@@ ded property is a problem for employees .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the board of au@@ di automob@@ ile manufacturers , says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they cannot be used as e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping devices .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es execu@@ tives to use simple prepa@@ id phones when travelling abroad , because smar@@ t@@ phones are likely to be com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id phones are thro@@ wn away after the event .
there is concern , however , that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to h@@ acking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective nic@@ he markets .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secre@@ ts from un@@ authorized access , ” the b@@ v@@ t war@@ ns in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own firms against economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence esti@@ m@@ ate has seen france , russia , and israel ran@@ ked second in the country to obtain $ 3@@ 50 billion in h@@ ack@@ ings .
a member of the board of a german blue chi@@ p company agreed to the fact that when it comes to economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , “ the french are the worst . ”
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french internal security service , d@@ cr@@ l , was inter@@ viewed this month in an interview with the following : “ the intelligence services know very well that all countries , even if they are working together .

parents of a te@@ en@@ ager from georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder and have been killed in a crime .
the te@@ en@@ ager &apos;s parents , whose bodies are being ro@@ lled together in a r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um of his high school , are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , the law@@ yer explained on thursday .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of georgia was born on 11 january in a u@@ pri@@ ght mat@@ te , which is placed behind the grand@@ stand in the school gym .
the sh@@ eri@@ ff investig@@ ators from low@@ n@@ des county concluded that the country ’ s military presence was a disaster .
&quot; they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , &quot; ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the ken@@ ne@@ th and jac@@ qu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son advoc@@ ate , declared to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the sh@@ eri@@ ff sle@@ w it .
“ they believe that it l@@ acks logic to viol@@ ate the laws of physi@@ cs as well as to common sense .
they are convinced that the truth is being hidden in order to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the cor@@ pse , &quot; he comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , as a number of important issues remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
mo@@ ore said this at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in whatever direction they are heading in .
my goal is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for formal investigation exists . ” said mr. ber@@ ger .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy suggests that jo@@ hn@@ son was ti@@ ed to the consequences of “ posi@@ tion-@@ in@@ duc@@ ed suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
but a second au@@ top@@ sy has produced another cause of death , according to mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added that if there is sufficient evidence of criminal or civil law investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , he would be the f@@ bi with the implementation of the investigation .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ff authority was not immediately available to comment on our question on thursday .
a court in southern georgia ordered on wednesday that the authorities should check all watch videos , which the investigation carried out was carried out .
te@@ en@@ ager ’ s parents said they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings contained h@@ ints on how he died .
c@@ dc publish aller@@ gy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( cen@@ ter@@ center for disease control and prevention ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with children &apos;s food aller@@ gies in schools .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of children with food aller@@ gies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now has food aller@@ gy .
the spread of food aller@@ gies among children has increased by 18 % , according to c@@ dc , between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that raise awareness of food aller@@ gies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who are aller@@ gic to it .
it is also recommended that schools have ep@@ in@@ ep@@ h@@ ry in stock – the auto injec@@ tion of the ep@@ is@@ cop@@ e brand is most commonly used – to avoid a potentially le@@ th@@ al hy@@ pers@@ en@@ si@@ tivity reaction .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently amended the rules so that schools of ep@@ in@@ ep@@ h@@ rit can keep it more easily .
the report also contains a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms , which are called by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is pus@@ hing on my ton@@ gue , ” “ my ton@@ gue feels as if a hair is on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue cri@@ b@@ bel@@ t ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can choose “ gender in@@ defin@@ ite ” .
germany is the first european nation to recognise a third sex for children who have un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gen@@ ital gen@@ ital problems .
new@@ born children are no longer being inf@@ er@@ red by men or women .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender to such children , but can be “ un@@ determined ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents to avoid ha@@ sty decisions on operations for sexual access .
according to bb@@ c years later , an inter@@ sexual person said : “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , ma@@ im@@ ed and filled with sc@@ ars .
it is estimated that one in 2@@ ,000 children every year is neither young nor girls .
they are among the inter@@ sexual , a group that is subject to the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( ds@@ d ) , a concept for people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , ger@@ ms , etc .
wall@@ is simp@@ son was perhaps inter@@ sex@@ ually .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the us suggest that you should try to get the best information available on gender allocation if a provision is not possible .
the new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who has specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ bl@@ ade after a good thing . ”
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ g@@ ical intervention , but for most children this is not the case , ” he said .
you can al@@ locate the gender without an operation and then see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate .
nobody knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it is stated that trans@@ sex@@ u@@ als or trans@@ gender people are to be distinguished , because their status is not gender related , but through their biological constitu@@ tions .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , hair , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , priority sexual and mental characteristics .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people face in their professional lives and the extent of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice .
young people who do not agree with the gender have a special camp now .
in the meantime , australia and ne@@ pal are able to access official documents by male , female or “ third sex . ”
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person after a court rul@@ ed that the life@@ time of a “ un@@ defined ” gender status had been granted .
in addition to m and w , german cards will have a third allocation in future , x for inter@@ sex@@ u@@ als , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighbor@@ ing france , gender issues are still controversial , such as news reports on france 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french meps from the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .
the us website catho@@ lic online has also opposed german law , on the grounds that “ if the world were to be drag@@ ged into a new state , where gender is a decision to take sexual activity but not to commit sexual activity , then it will .
the mother of a new@@ born from mar@@ y@@ land told baby zone that it would be better if bab@@ ies were to have a gender at birth .
“ paren@@ tal existence is already stres@@ s@@ ful enough without further restrictions , especially when one considers the gender of one ’ s child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children who have been involved in both male and female sex have been treated as her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , according to the attractive greek god , who both sex@@ es had .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be elimin@@ ated and then re@@ built .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being ques@@ tioned , now that we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child gro@@ ws up with the child &apos;s weight .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called a “ psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
when such a child was born , it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t that was called , but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory on the treatment of children with un@@ clear gen@@ it@@ als is based on dr. john money from joh@@ ns ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who argu@@ ed that gender is formal .
he shaped the term “ gender identity ” and argu@@ ed that social and environmental stimul@@ us – as parents would have to educ@@ ate a child – inter@@ acted with gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es of a child , and shaped them like that .
but in a book called “ john / jo@@ an ” , published in 196@@ 6 , his the@@ ories were controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is was thro@@ wn away by a bot@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to ca@@ str@@ ate the child and also to remove his te@@ stic@@ les and then raise him as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of transformation , but it was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male gender and married a woman .
at 38 but he committed su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the adv@@ ent of the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender operations have appeared to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old mon@@ tan@@ a author who has worked with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als .
doctors were un@@ aware of whether he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never be a “ satis@@ fying life ” as a man .
so his external or@@ gan and the te@@ stic@@ les were sur@@ g@@ ically removed shortly after birth in 197@@ 6 and raised as a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i am not a girl , ” he explained to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com , and he said to ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com .
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should be given a v@@ ag@@ inal plas@@ tics .
but , because he was and was de@@ pressed , something was wrong , he demanded his medical records .
what he found was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth – and nobody ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d that did not allow his body enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to develop gen@@ it@@ als .
after learning the truth , he returned to the male identity , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one injec@@ tions , and let his bre@@ asts be removed .
the sur@@ gery has made it inf@@ er@@ tile .
today he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to see inter@@ sexual people per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of california ’ s ad@@ vo@@ cat@@ es for in@@ for@@ matic law group , is providing the best possible service to the german law “ to st@@ amp and sti@@ f@@ le .
“ many activi@@ sts are concerned that the german decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to allow the child to “ assi@@ gn ” non-@@ fixed , ” she explained .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to treat the male or female sex and then wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organisation supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .
german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a battle to force small children at this time .
if you are mature , you can decide for yourself about your body .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a viol@@ a di@@ o@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who was a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says the german law .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ -@@ resistance .
due to the target cells def@@ ect for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one , k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina but not a u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today k@@ ati@@ e 29 is married and she works at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania as a child psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t employee .
it is inf@@ er@@ tile , but hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a sur@@ ro@@ gate mother .
“ the law gives parents space , which means that they do not have to make decisions in ha@@ ste , ” bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you time to test different things and to clarify things , giving you time before you are “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you raise the child and lo@@ ves it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and you do not have to rus@@ h into an operation that can no longer be rever@@ sed .
“ this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are up@@ setting because they believe they are not the right ones to do the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that su@@ its him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make their own choices .
unknown in@@ jur@@ ies girls by shot
unknown people have a 12@@ -@@ year-@@ old in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t in sho@@ ts from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had probably been killed by an air pressure weapon in gen@@ th@@ in on a group of children on thursday evening .
the police told us this .
the girl had been slightly w@@ oun@@ ded on the left w@@ ade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also shot at a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then dro@@ ve it .
the criminal police investig@@ ated it was said on friday .
up to now , the police inspection k@@ emp@@ ten has been able to look back at a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
officials were only called to e@@ at@@ ers twice , which war@@ ned them against fac@@ ades of houses .
since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the e@@ gg@@ s immediately , no material damage should have been caused .
in addition , some sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter b@@ ö@@ ller were lit in the city area , but again no material damage was caused .
a resid@@ ent in the bis@@ hop friend@@ ship or@@ fer way reported that his car was wra@@ pped in a kno@@ b and his wheel ap@@ er@@ ture was sto@@ len .
until the police arrived , however , the man has his wheel ap@@ er@@ ture in the immediate vicinity found all again , which is why the police did not have to take any further action .
living with a future
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries actually lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t have any fear of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; asked wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and points to a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time now .
but you know how difficult this is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason is not spi@@ der pho@@ bia , however , but the concern that at the age of the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be managed , she explains .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the mi@@ grant has had to find out for her@@ self what it means to deal with handic@@ ap from floor to floor .
a book recently published by her about &apos; happy living at age - what form of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what is not possible at all in old age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when they entered the ma@@ is@@ on@@ et@@ te apartment with their hus@@ band more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today with the middle of fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently about it .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who actually deal with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most are pus@@ hing it out as long as it goes .
the old people are getting only the others &apos; , she says sch@@ mun@@ n@@ el@@ nd .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great are we concerned .
&apos;@@ then it may be too late &apos; , says ries .
in her book the interior architec@@ t presents 17 models of living in self-@@ determined living in old age .
&apos;@@ whatever type of living you choose is always an individual choice &apos; , she explains .
d i solution do not give it to age .
even those who wish to reti@@ re in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should always consider that they can also be si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also combine in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; the author of the book gives you the chance to think about people who want to set@@ tle .
their models include classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often quo@@ ted pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; w@@ g .
at age , everyone has his tic@@ ks and fla@@ kes .
&quot; but for me , such a community would be nothing &quot; , says it with a win@@ k .
not at all like a student w@@ g with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&quot; at age , you simply need your re@@ treat rooms , &quot; says ries .
the fact that a senior community can still function is something that the author does not want to exclu@@ de .
but that must be different from the classic student w@@ g .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &apos; she believes .
she is not alone in the capital of the country .
&quot; most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own home as long as possible , &quot; is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the citizens &apos; service living at the age of the provin@@ cial capital .
your service advis@@ es people around the topic &apos; getting older &apos; .
that is why elderly people , in particular , would often accept in@@ convenience and restrictions just to stay in their habit@@ ual environment , which is also the experience of the sti@@ f@@ tun@@ g wa@@ ren@@ test .
there are many ways to reach the house or the apartment without barriers .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those who are looking for a new home or home in accordance with the age of their home should first be informed and not be the first to order the best cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today there are specialists for the conversion of the old building .
even in the rental apartment , some can be realized , and if only the toilet seat increase is the reason , the interior architec@@ t will clarify .
but it is not always possible to change the existing apartment in a way that is accessible to the age and therefore accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
this experience was what wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to do .
the room was very small and the bathroom was very small .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your hus@@ band .
before moving , she gra@@ yed more than before the spi@@ der on her apartment door .
the us wants to pursue snow@@ den
the us has not changed its stance on former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still being accused of having il@@ legally dis@@ closed secret information .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the united states , said the us state department spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
the recent statements by snow@@ den would not change this either .
before that , german green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le had a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow to call on the us not to continue to thre@@ aten him with pun@@ ishment .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that the str@@ ingent statements are those of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , not those of a german government member .
intelligence contrac@@ tors ed@@ ward snow@@ den have been prepared to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this was the case with former n@@ sa staff , who was looking for the us , in a letter that was not addressed to the green politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on friday after a meeting with snow@@ bun@@ den , and published it .
the letter has been translated according to a translation widely used by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am called ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and i was previously contrac@@ ted or directly appointed as a technical expert at the national security agency ( n@@ sa ) , central intelligence ( c@@ s@@ r ) .
in my work in these institutions , i have witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law by my government , which have led me to act on the basis of a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i have been exposed to a serious and persi@@ stent heat that has forced me to leave my family and home .
i live in ex@@ ile and enjoy temporary asylum , which is something the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the united states - have made rev@@ el@@ ations a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance that is not accoun@@ table to anyone as a service to the public .
these es@@ pi@@ on@@ age rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives based on the previously conce@@ aled abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks that have been acquired have been clearly reduced .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as a fl@@ ou@@ ting of faith and to crimin@@ alise political expression and to prosecu@@ te them .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will aband@@ on this ab@@ ject attitude .
i hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the actions taken in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authentic@@ ity .
i look forward to meeting you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to up@@ hold international law , which protec@@ ts us all .

&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en &apos;s may@@ or michael ma@@ i@@ er says .
the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten in the gar@@ ten@@ stra@@ ß@@ e has sold the commun@@ e to a private person .
the sale was approved by the municip@@ al council at its recent meeting in the non-@@ public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , says ma@@ i@@ er .
the budget was eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
the may@@ or is right that w@@ inter@@ l@@ ings should pass responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter , and thus no longer have to pay for the house ’ s entertainment , like heating , looking out to the garden and watching .
&quot; this effort is gone , &quot; ma@@ i@@ er is pleased .

report : obama campaign considered to replace bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers have deliber@@ ated in secret to ap@@ point vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ table surprise of the long-@@ awa@@ ited work by mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : game change 2012 . ”
the times is a copy of the book that will be published shortly and it reported on thursday evening that the to@@ ky@@ o press consult@@ ants had “ extensive group meetings and po@@ lls at the end of 2011 ” to find out .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , national political correspon@@ dent of the times , the book is a thorough account of the efforts of leading campaign@@ ers and white house staff , notably the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chic@@ ago and the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the president ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , obama ’ s former campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house chief advis@@ or , david ax@@ el@@ ff@@ e w@@ oud and david .
in double down , it is said that dal@@ ey was at the fore@@ front of efforts to keep bi@@ den alive despite her “ tight personal relationship ” before being able to fight against such a move .
in an interview with martin , dal@@ ey confirmed that the government had indeed considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with clin@@ ton .
“ i said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” said dal@@ ey to the magazine .
it should be re@@ mem@@ bered that the president had terrible po@@ ll values at the time , so we thought , “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
while dal@@ ey considers the investigations to be “ due d@@ ili@@ gence , ” martin said to an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that considerable effort was made during the re-@@ election campaign to find out whether such a move was appropriate .
“ campaigns don ’ t spend so much money on po@@ lls and focus groups unless you think seriously about something , ” martin explained on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team had thought about an exchange .
martin said to c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey whether his then bo@@ ss was aware of the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” for obama to know about it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether political expl@@ or@@ ations by obama ’ s desk would have reached .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously think obama had not known anything about the investigations about whether to use bi@@ den in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin rep@@ lied .
what happens on the go with my e-mail ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letters .
was e-mail used in the design of the internet service , similar to the traditional post , to trans@@ pose the letter sec@@ rec@@ y ?
the concept of early internet services was to make communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s have not been designed to provide a stable foundation for a hearing safe correspon@@ dence .
therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; sen@@ ds a mail , the computers of the two are then directly connected ?
the e-mail program or the browser of anna sen@@ ds the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , google would be .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that ben@@ ni uses .
on the route , the mail can run over several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then call the content from his provider .
if conventional e-@@ ma@@ ils are read through the internet ?
most ma@@ ils are read by software robo@@ ts on the go .
the sen@@ der &apos;s provider generally checks whether the mail is a mal@@ icious program as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
on the recei@@ ver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
furthermore , the providers check whether this is a an@@ no@@ ying and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail that is deleted or at least converted into a sp@@ am folder .
do robo@@ ts have another task ?
on systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information google needs to place context advertising .
when anna and ben@@ ni communicate via g@@ mail about their coming holiday trip , google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers .
do unknown people read the em@@ ail@@ s ?
the prob@@ ability that un@@ authorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administr@@ ators often have the possibility to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to inter@@ cep@@ t or take note of e-@@ ma@@ ils .
there are also possible illegal cu@@ t-@@ off actions .
is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils from reading ?
encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard allows an email to be encry@@ p@@ ted effectively against reading .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to hide the met@@ ad@@ ata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even possible to recognize who has communic@@ ated with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the most priv@@ ately used mail@@ boxes are the subject of an investigation by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , according to a survey by y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o-@@ mail ’ s shares were down most recently , g@@ mail was able to increase significantly from google .
mother in the forest dis@@ gu@@ ised and reti@@ red
when his mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg for@@ ged a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to pay her pension and care .
to obtain further pensions and care@@ -@@ giving , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg has left his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest .
first , he covered up the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old , then he spent more than a year and a half on the money .
now the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old has to answer for fraud , as one speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected back in may : at that time , the poor mother had no medic@@ ation .
the pen@@ sion@@ er told the investig@@ ators that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because officials were cur@@ ious , they continued to investigate .
the two were born in a common apartment for more than 15 years and last maintained them .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old finally ad@@ mitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an ob@@ duc@@ tion did not indicate a capital crime .
want to have ice cre@@ am that lights up in the dark ?
a british business@@ man has the first ice cre@@ am in the dark – with the help of j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
char@@ lie franc@@ is made the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of sea animals use and created the ideal light for the sea .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced chinese scientists to arti@@ fici@@ ally produce the sh@@ ining prote@@ in .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue during consumption , which means that the ph value in the prote@@ in is raised and the light is tri@@ g@@ ge@@ red .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the heat in the mouth and g@@ lows – so the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company “ lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two gram@@ s of it ” .
the prote@@ in used in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue at a neutral ph value .
when the mouth he@@ ats the prote@@ in , the ph value and the ice bri@@ gh@@ tens up .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to market hal@@ lo@@ ween because it was this wonderful lu@@ min@@ air@@ e effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever made , because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish is four times more expensive than gold .
every ball costs me about g@@ b@@ p 1@@ 40 .
but for that it tas@@ tes ta@@ sty .
char@@ lies experim@@ ental company based in bri@@ st@@ ol is famous for its unusual flav@@ ours , including beer , cheese , wine , and other products .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says : “ i want to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am . ”
this is impossible in itself because of the re@@ fr@@ action of light caused by the ice cryst@@ als from which ice cre@@ am is made ; but i susp@@ ect we will find a way to create it .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a tor@@ ment arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still in the hands after six days of playing without any point .
it is now precisely for the team of ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers that the day will be the der@@ by against the ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season starts for us .
&quot; i hope that we will finally have our heads free &quot; , e@@ h@@ lers &apos;s behaviour gives him optim@@ istic .
he has finally done so , with the exception of the end@@ uring h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me , his entire cad@@ re .
like us , da@@ ver@@ den also reli@@ es on speed play .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but , first and foremost , we need to increase the coverage , which , at the last moment , has left anything but a certain impression .
the co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z is much more relaxed after the first season victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was of course a house number .
but that &apos;s why we are not the favourite for a long time , because everything can always happen in der@@ by .
pan@@ it@@ z wants to be back in mor@@ sum to start a series .
is missing jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te j@@ od@@ at .
for this purpose , the young jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ fu@@ ß , who is entitled to play double at the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ lig@@ ist h@@ c bre@@ men , is celebr@@ ating his season de@@ but .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : figures
when i was small hal@@ lo@@ ween had something mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , to stay late and to d@@ ress us for the neighbor@@ hood .
today i am more likely to become a hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
over the last two years i have not agreed to speak of s@@ wee@@ ts from my home and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but according to the statistics , i am a black she@@ ep as far as hal@@ lo@@ ween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – celebrate hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , giving a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion in c@@ and@@ y , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations , according to the us federation .
one thing i can rely on every hal@@ lo@@ ween then again is the trend values .
the cost@@ umes will cost about 1.@@ 2 billion of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting , in@@ anim@@ ate objects are the final cr@@ y .
women no longer have to wear sex@@ y clothes , they can now also eat temp@@ ting food like piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the d@@ af@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space designers will put it into the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sought cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates , and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we dres@@ sed our dogs last year and were therefore not alone to my surprise .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on pe@@ ts ’ cost@@ umes , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for s@@ wee@@ ts , we are not zim@@ per@@ ous .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
that is about 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate , lu@@ t@@ sch@@ ers , can@@ dies and rubber be@@ ards .
so good news for the us department of commerce ’ s 41 million people who are being killed by the saying “ sweet or ac@@ id ” in the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
in fact , we will have more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n , which is sweet , but still 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold around hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize c@@ ans .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more like hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where it sp@@ its .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which in fact is a real prison ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck ” .
there are actually 1,@@ 200 officially recognized sp@@ uk@@ houses in the united states that generate $ 500 million in revenue , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you can look in your tr@@ ous@@ ers .
but let us finally get to the cu@@ t@@ backs .
char@@ lie brown made us familiar with the great pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and car@@ ving a shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree – something we learned from a small age .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in ” trend only began last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ rest , so most of us have grown up to cut the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in and not to sit in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million on cu@@ t@@ backs , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n , slowly ro@@ tting in the front garden , is probably from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where this year 24@@ 5 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in were har@@ ves@@ ted .
if you want to score points correctly , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and car@@ ve something pretty out of their 9@@ 21 kil@@ o of heavy pum@@ p@@ k@@ in .
the new york times is a new year ’ s eve .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to be left in hel@@ bre@@ cht at the late thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof begins at night to fire on friday .
the rescue forces have a bo@@ iled cor@@ pse from the house .
rescue forces have a very serious problem with a fire in hel@@ bre@@ cht in a three-@@ family house .
whether it is a resid@@ ent handle is still un@@ clear how a spo@@ kes@@ man of the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said .
on late thursday evening , it had bur@@ ned on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames were already be@@ ating from a window .
the forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room .
this and another room bur@@ ned out completely .
the entire ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spo@@ kes@@ man continued to explain .
the building was not in@@ hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany ’ s largest state church has launched an off@@ ensive to promote the pa@@ st@@ or ’ s profes@@ sion .
background is a possible short@@ age of pa@@ st@@ ors : the ev@@ angel@@ ic@@ -@@ lu@@ ther@@ an church of the state of han@@ over exp@@ ects that the number of its currently 1,@@ 800 pa@@ stor@@ alists and pa@@ st@@ ors will rise by 30 .
for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in con@@ vers@@ ation with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to determine the working and day@@ -to-@@ day running of your own .
the first time the church of the state has built a pa@@ st@@ or in a full place , commission@@ ed a young person to in@@ sp@@ ire them to study the@@ ology .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are deci@@ ding to study the@@ ology after their gradu@@ ation .
bur@@ fi@@ a leads this back to the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and i can set my priorities where i feel it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors , as a sou@@ l@@ wor@@ m , may be very close to the people .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well of it .
certainly , there is more pay in the free economy , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this is a good way to meet the young people of today who are not only concerned with care@@ ers but with a job full of sen@@ ses .
according to the state church , which comprises three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , around 60 pa@@ st@@ ors currently reti@@ re each year .
at the same time , some 40 gradu@@ ates of a the@@ ology studies start their vic@@ ari@@ at .
in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land or w@@ end@@ land , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
bur@@ fi@@ a wants to host study days for young people and also invite cele@@ bri@@ ties to study the@@ ology .
the the@@ ology studies offer a broad education .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced

the options range from rein@@ forced bra@@ kes , a service package with support for bow@@ ler works mechan@@ ics and log@@ is@@ tical support to vehicle storage between events .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bow@@ ler motor@@ sport , explains : “ the r@@ ally customers who come to bow@@ ler have changed . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for ex@@ ci@@ tement and adventure and an achiev@@ able way to world class events .
we are pleased to be able to continue this path in partnership with land ro@@ ver and m@@ sa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to meet the different r@@ ally discipl@@ ines in the uk and abroad and to meet new players at the show .
we really enjoyed the def@@ en@@ der challenge car – that will be an enter@@ taining championship .
in addition , the def@@ en@@ der challenge has a training and test day in february and the option to participate in deser@@ t rac@@ es in north africa and the middle east .
fire bri@@ g@@ ade called to save a dog that is 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ro@@ cky out@@ cro@@ p in a quar@@ ry .
ru@@ by co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el@@ -@@ bit@@ ch had run out after a small traffic accident .
three days later , a wal@@ ker in the quar@@ ry discovered it in its un@@ favourable position .
fire@@ figh@@ ters ro@@ lled down on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed to secure a dog that was on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e high lead in a rock wall .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by was killed after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before she was released from a quar@@ ry on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , to whom the dog belongs , came to the quar@@ ry fla@@ pp@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to take ru@@ by again .
they had desper@@ ately been looking for their missing female and had been calling for help in social networks when they looked for the small traffic accident in the quar@@ ry .
about 2 : 15 pm on wednesday , a wal@@ ker who had to show his dog saw the str@@ an@@ ded ru@@ by on the 15@@ -@@ meter high paragraph in the quar@@ ry .
the technical rescue team of the cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station was on the spot and ro@@ lled to rescue rub@@ ys , who then moved to a dog fire box .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move mus@@ cles during her rescue – she was like sti@@ ff fro@@ zen .
but now it is doing well .
she then had a few dog ca@@ kes .
this was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ ru@@ by had a giant sl@@ ash . ”
they could have been seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was investig@@ ated as a veter@@ in@@ arian , but he was not able to detec@@ t anything except exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ watching rescue was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i could not believe that she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian explained that if exhaus@@ tion had become too great and it had collap@@ sed , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters have done a great job .
it was really bra@@ ve what you did .
we are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son from ke@@ i@@ th@@ ley added : “ we were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explains that he never did kat@@ y per@@ ry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said she had been a background sing@@ er at j@@ ag@@ gers song “ old hab@@ its the hard ” from 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had dinner with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er and that “ he dre@@ w me up when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”
in a statement , a representative hun@@ ters , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categ@@ or@@ ically denied that he had ever tried to bring about rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with kat@@ y per@@ ry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she conf@@ used him with someone else . ”
per@@ ry was one of the sing@@ ers who played at the ro@@ ll@@ ing-@@ stone tour this year .
her new album „ pris@@ m “ was ran@@ ked # 1 this week .
george ke@@ re@@ van : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice of making the choice
a new day , a new story of terror for independence .
this time we are being war@@ ned that an independent scotland is necessary to make the schengen area a condition for eu membership .
this provides the keyword for stories about pass@@ port controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a story that is secured with bar@@ bed wire along the h@@ adri@@ an wall .
in fact , in the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de template , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that would enta@@ il more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this did not , as expected , feature in the head@@ lines .
no one has mentioned that eu member states often apply their strict rules when it is beneficial for them .
as scotland is not currently part of the schengen area , continuing non-@@ compliance with brussels would be a small conc@@ ession in return for what one really wants from the sco@@ ts .
so , really no story .
and one that has come to be a fo@@ ssi@@ l already in the years : the first time i saw the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
one interesting point is lost in the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient story .
why expect an independent scotland to be governed by the european pi@@ pe ?
why the london yo@@ ke against the one that brussels is s@@ wa@@ king up to , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-@@ war plan for the unification of europe has st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
throughout the eu , parties that are anti-@@ eu or are using the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic party could not support alternative to germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the federal election in september , effectively weak@@ ening the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british democr@@ at ) .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
because of the strict au@@ ster@@ ity policies imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in connection with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et that the national economy is forced into by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the european project is too far-@@ reaching .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has set members on exchange rates that benefit german ex@@ porters – and this is what german politicians would like to leave .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending – sp@@ ur@@ red by berlin .
behind the current et@@ at and currency problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity problem .
as a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by brussels – a code for subsidi@@ zing french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – european industry pays a lot of money compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we saw in gran@@ ge@@ mouth .
all the world &apos;s wage de@@ preci@@ ation does not protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being driven into the corner from cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former che@@ er@@ leader of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to sh@@ ut germany in check and look at paris on an equal foot@@ ing with washington .
but berlin needs paris no more than a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy and has pressed europe into its own economic policy , which is what the strugg@@ ling french economy is strugg@@ ling with .
the result : marine le pen &apos;s right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu front national has just won a decisive re-@@ election , thereby pus@@ hing the ruling socialists to third .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the british labour party that it is not likely to see a split in the right spectrum .
what makes le pen with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the european parliament for the first time .
that is the point i want to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment of the eu and the single currency will come together to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” the general de ga@@ ul@@ le fav@@ ored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may remain st@@ uck with the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of eng@@ aging with the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific suggests that britain alone in the atlantic rain will be in the making .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( at last ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including , say , berlin and brussels , what they can bo@@ w down to where .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could be completely excluded from a loo@@ ser european union , provided we retain our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is a necessity in a non-@@ federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider doing the same for norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland – remark@@ ably – is the most successful political movement against au@@ ster@@ ity in europe , and has achieved a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts .

early pub@@ er@@ ty : grow faster
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries , as studies show .
physical changes do not directly mean pub@@ er@@ ty .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible for the disease .
experts believe that ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is a tri@@ gger for early pub@@ er@@ ty , and that it is a source of the early ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent period .
the trend towards early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people , especially in young people , who are more likely to be young and old .
the former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist who speci@@ ali@@ zes in child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned that her daughter is already bre@@ ast and sh@@ am@@ hair at the age of seven or eight years ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pe@@ d@@ ago@@ gic and pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pedi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ ine dr. paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wi@@ tz explained this .
“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually this is no sign that the pub@@ er@@ ty is fast coming , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious indic@@ ations of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ am@@ bo@@ y@@ hair and under@@ hair , as well as body od@@ or , are evident in girls earlier .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift at the age of the men@@ ar@@ che ( appearance of the first ble@@ eding ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ when bre@@ asts develop , it takes at least two to three years to reach the men@@ ar@@ che , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty for girls : the essential advice to deal with this .
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial what actually marks the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is “ early ” when the bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ ill before the age of eight .
in most cases , the process is slow@@ ing or stag@@ n@@ ating – something a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an can monitor closely .
if progress is made more quickly , tests could be performed by an en@@ di@@ k@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist to avoid serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ours or cy@@ sts .
there are methods of dela@@ ying early men@@ stru@@ ation and preventing another consequence : pre@@ mature aging .
the recommendations for medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant about medicines , but he ad@@ mits : “ sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty can cause behavi@@ oral problems and the feel@@ ings of girls , unlike their ag@@ e-@@ com@@ r@@ ades . ”
the other major problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they are concerned about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or about how to handle the hygi@@ ene side , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman re@@ members , whose daughter got her ten days .
even if there were some signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was not emo@@ tionally prepared .
she was fri@@ ghten@@ ed and ex@@ ci@@ ted from school home because she was the first in her friends circle .
there are many widely public@@ ized the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es are produced in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .
bo@@ ys , like girls , are in the early pub@@ er@@ ty .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the launch of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , which showed a connection between body f@@ at and admission to pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a part .
in this country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to gen@@ es .
another pu@@ zz@@ le : although bo@@ ys have already used to grow their face and sh@@ am@@ po@@ o hair , the trend towards a full-@@ scale former pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pron@@ oun@@ ced as girls .
other doctors at the a@@ ap conference emphasised the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ hair is common even in bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful how we identify the true beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b children .
parents should not hesitate to be advis@@ ed by their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an how to talk to their child .
“ this may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected ” , said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child usually re@@ acts well .
girls who fl@@ our@@ ish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .
jum@@ bo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders , in the face of large orders .
a cl@@ ash has ar@@ is@@ en between leading aircraft manufacturers over the wide range of seats in the tourist class on long-@@ hau@@ l flights , which has set the tone for a bit@@ ter cl@@ ash at du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show this month .
the dispute re@@ vol@@ ves around the seat width , which passengers can use for long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned about airlines , but this designated passenger space is the key to the success of the airline .
airbus this week demanded an industry standard that has a se@@ ating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) in the tourist class , but the us arch@@ -@@ ri@@ val bo@@ eing says that this should be the case .
the dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are compe@@ ting to produce even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l aircraft .
as the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed – especially if it has ro@@ ws of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated that will be the new “ mini jum@@ bo ” design .
bo@@ eing claims that its moder@@ ni@@ zed “ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x ” record 4@@ 06 people with tourist seats that exceed 17 in@@ ches wide and thus ten per row allow .
airbus has declared that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 will carry 3@@ 50 people in 18 in@@ ch wide se@@ ated in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often dis@@ agree with technical details through advertising in the press .
now , before the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , airbus is appe@@ aling , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x will probably start the race with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .
recently , the company presented an ad that is the beginning of a new ad war , and that showed don@@ ors a picture in which three people were squ@@ ash@@ ed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would they accept that ? ”
&quot; bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are more narrow than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , &quot; says airbus sales chief john lea@@ h@@ y .
in the face of changed eating hab@@ its , people become th@@ ick@@ er , but aircraft seats have not changed rad@@ ically .
between the early 197@@ 0 ’ s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 defined modern long-@@ distance travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the average male american rose between 40 and 49 years by ten per cent .
the wa@@ ist range of the average male american in the 21st century is 10@@ 0.@@ 8 cm , according to us health statistics .
airbus says that its ri@@ val adhe@@ res to a se@@ ating concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average body size of the “ jet set ” , which was recently b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed , was smaller .
studies have been carried out , according to airbus , which show that an additional customs duty ( 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat increases the sle@@ eping quality by 53 % .
bo@@ eing is den@@ ying airbus ’ figures to the se@@ ating dimensions and says that it is not at the manufacturers &apos; discre@@ tion to decide how airlines can maintain the balance between air fa@@ res and equipment .
the company also explains that according to the investigations , the experience on the aircraft is more than the seat width .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they can , in their view , to succeed . ”
you do not want us to dict@@ ate to you what makes you prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are concerned with more freedom of el@@ bo@@ w , but manufacturers will increasingly be faced with a subject that relates to sales .
behind the competition is a race to order aircraft with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the us or europe &apos;s export balance .
as re@@ u@@ ters first reported in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate about the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-@@ engine long-@@ range designs than the market leader in this segment , which has 3@@ 65 seats .
the statements made by bo@@ eing about the results depend in part on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x , with its ten seats per row , is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than the current ten seats per row machines .
&quot; bo@@ eing squ@@ ee@@ zes more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , &quot; k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston says , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full cab@@ ins with ten seats per row at existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s indicate that many passengers chose the nar@@ ro@@ wer arrangement , which would be accompanied by cheaper air fa@@ res .
&quot; eigh@@ teen in@@ ch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is threatened by the threat of the 7@@ 77 , &quot; says mar@@ y .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .
the world travel@@ ers jet sel@@ lers even carry band@@ width to make the equipment measure with the competition .
even if they promote comfort , all manufacturers offer je@@ ts with high compres@@ sed design .
airbus has a ten@@ -@@ se@@ ater a3@@ 50 , but has not sold it as it claims .
until recently , airbus has stressed the importance of greater flexibility in the cab@@ ins and the need for seats at the cor@@ rid@@ ors that are broad for some je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to dis@@ appear , but will be overwhel@@ med by the wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could put a stop to smoking pleasure .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that can spo@@ il the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine could protect m@@ ice from nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for a life@@ time .
before testing on humans , further tests are needed , which may take a few years to come , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy can help millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop and who are using all the methods available on the market , but who have had to experience that their nic@@ he is more .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects the li@@ ver cells , which then provide a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize them before they break the brain , which results in a smo@@ ker not being a nic@@ ot@@ ine high .
in tri@@ als , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice ad@@ min@@ istered to nic@@ ot@@ ine kept their normal level of activity .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are published in the journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they had been anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ inations had to be used to maintain the level of anti@@ bodies so often that they would be expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is probably much lower , because it trans@@ forms li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future vacc@@ ine for people , if it is safe , could give birth to children before they are temp@@ ted to take a le@@ th@@ al .
but smo@@ kers are more likely to use it to stop .
“ you know : if you start smoking again , you will feel a sense of danger because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that helps you to break the hab@@ it ” , he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time war@@ ned that further research was needed .
tri@@ po@@ di denied , influenced by o@@ be@@ id , was a member of the tri@@ po@@ di community .
the former labour minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di of new south wal@@ es is being investig@@ ated by the state corruption control .
the former minister for n@@ s@@ w den@@ ies that the rules on maritime le@@ asing , at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , have changed the co@@ ver@@ t involvement in three land on state@@ -@@ controlled land .
the independent commission against cor@@ ru@@ ption ( ic@@ ao ) is a commission against corruption and has been working on the issue of the issue on friday of whether o@@ be@@ id has received various ministers of state in this direction .
now , because of the acc@@ us@@ ation that tri@@ po@@ di has a hidden interest in the land from o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ d@@ is has been forced to replace the former depu@@ ty chief of staff ly@@ n@@ ne ash@@ ne as@@ ch@@ a .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had insi@@ sted on public ten@@ der for le@@ ase contracts .
the pe@@ as@@ ants were against it and wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies on the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which gave o@@ be@@ ids $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tend@@ ers .
tri@@ po@@ di , the port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , was originally in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he dec@@ lined to make the changes at o@@ be@@ id ’ s request , which , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , was aimed at re@@ forming the government ’ s le@@ ase arrangements .
one of the ic@@ ac ’ s telephone records showed conver@@ sa@@ tions between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di , and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who was transferred to the port ministry after he was be@@ aten under o@@ be@@ di@@ ence .
“ was the topic discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the elabor@@ ation of commercial packaging regulations ? ” , the depu@@ ty commissioner an@@ th@@ ony whe@@ al@@ y tri@@ po@@ di asked .
“ no , ” tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .

israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack targets in syria , according to official sources , and the military is not a source of military power .
israeli hun@@ ting plan@@ es would have been a destination in the sy@@ ri@@ an port of lat@@ ak@@ ia on thursday night , a senior government official confirmed to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , the goal was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already made air stri@@ kes on missi@@ le deli@@ veries to syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could under@@ go “ real estate ” testing .
the government is thinking about a “ test of authentic@@ ity ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as as as part of enhanced measures .
if the test were to be introduced , it would be applied through a criteri@@ on to prevent the 4@@ 57 from being used to fill un@@ qualified jobs or as a back door to the move of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour mp , max@@ ine m@@ c@@ ke@@ w , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ vo@@ cal explanations such as “ foreign@@ ers are to be on the back ” and , austr@@ ali@@ ans should hire first , ” are a very un@@ pleasant back@@ drop in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said australia .
histor@@ ically , this has been said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echo this historic ar@@ te@@ fact , they would be able to do so without surprise .
the proposal for a debate out@@ lines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , the immigration minister , who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in s@@ ri lan@@ ka , has proposed five of the proposed changes that will be adopted , and the others will be considered .
if the “ criteri@@ on of authentic@@ ity ” is adopted , then someone applying for a visa could be re@@ viewed to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the visa is required .
firms may also be obliged to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after a number of companies that have previously been able to emplo@@ y only a small number of workers , after all , hundreds .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker probably died of a heart attack after he had been sent to the christmas market with a refugee boat this week .
the dis@@ rup@@ ted n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-@@ old son of the man who came to australia with him has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult c@@ ous@@ in , who was also on the boat .
austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study that will demonstrate the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
h@@ s@@ 2 ltd is working on the idea of a new project to be launched from phase 1 in 20@@ 26 , with high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
minister for transport bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project will bring britain closer together .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail connection between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 fin@@ ishes there will be connections to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed road between london and northern england from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has instruc@@ ted h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look for further capacity and travel time improvements for n@@ ord@@ en@@ and and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network of routes that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are making progress with h@@ s@@ 2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
but it is also about the connection between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is being improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
the scot@@ tish secretary of state ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for the scot@@ tish involvement in the h@@ s@@ 2 network to be “ un@@ mista@@ k@@ ably ” .
brown said : “ the high-@@ speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , but at the same time , scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which will benefit everyone and will make the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh connection comple@@ mentary to the scot@@ tish government .
i look forward to discussing the report with the british ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an air passengers must continue to use tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones on star@@ tup and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules on such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) allows us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can be checked during critical flight ph@@ ases during e-@@ books , videos can see or play , if they are in the “ air traffic ” mode .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they have to leave their e-@@ books on the start and lan@@ ding .
austr@@ ali@@ an societies are watching the decision that us airlines have to do a huge amount of work to implement , but are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air traffic control agency casa also said that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia are still valid .
“ casa has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” was announced .
the subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines can maintain safety at all times and passengers can use the safety instructions given by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already started to talk about extending its wi-fi entertainment system to include flights with casa and explains that it is open to changes , that they need to be initiated by the legisl@@ ator .
“ we would like to see casa re@@ viewing the authorisation of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we have ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight . ”
q@@ ant@@ as said that they would remain with current regulations for the time being .
“ our current policy is that electronic devices will not be used at the start and lan@@ ding , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” said the company .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will be very interested in the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has a different impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft toler@@ ate the radio distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by mobile devices , and manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can make it easier for passengers to use port@@ able , light electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones at any height ” , said .
in rare cases , the crew will instruc@@ t passengers to take the necessary equipment to the lan@@ ding stage .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices be safe@@ ly placed under the seat or in the com@@ part@@ ments above the seats when they were started and lan@@ ded .
before the sch@@ al@@ ke district by , there were also some of the b@@ v@@ b tra@@ il@@ ers with light missi@@ les for u@@ g@@ ly scenes in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced tough consequences .
before friday &apos;s match of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a football league against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , the ul@@ tr@@ as re@@ acted with a silence - first .
it was an un@@ familiar , almost g@@ ho@@ stly ac@@ ous@@ tics that could be felt to the vie@@ wer just before the beginning of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a game between german vice champi@@ on bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d and dem v@@ v@@ d .
the audience was mostly listening to the guest fans with their songs .
the south grand@@ stands , by contrast , where the most loy@@ al - and lou@@ dest - b@@ v@@ b fans , initially presented themselves in an excep@@ tionally quiet way : no songs , no calls for slau@@ ghter .
the po@@ dium of the cap@@ o , which otherwise coordinated the joint launch , remained un@@ filled .
and , at the front of the gallery , a great flag , with the title &quot; section sta@@ dium ban &quot; , stood alone .
only as go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always was the first b@@ v@@ b player to enter the course , was a short-term ju@@ bil@@ ation .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vo@@ cal voc@@ als and we@@ aring scar@@ ves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grand@@ stands , nothing was sti@@ r@@ red up .
the fact that sta@@ dium speakers nor@@ bert dic@@ kel have once again re@@ viewed the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , extension of tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not cause festi@@ vals .
only five minutes before the first hit , the cap@@ o kno@@ c@@ ked his po@@ dium - and which until then had been almost with hands tangible tension .
finally , as always , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally , the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium was again as usual .
and at the latest when the south grand@@ stand has heard the lou@@ dly call for &apos; der@@ by winners stand on &apos; , everything was again as usual .
silence before that was probably a response to what has happened over the past few days .
just before re@@ vi@@ er@@ der@@ by at the f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 some of the co-@@ travel@@ ers had launched light missi@@ les into the audience ran@@ ks and fi@@ red onto the square - almost tor@@ n down .
the game was dela@@ yed due to cha@@ otic scenes .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had the top of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as in his office - and he believes wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words , this was more im@@ prob@@ able for the fan appointment .
&quot; it will require massive cuts for the entire ul@@ tra-@@ movement , &quot; the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss announced on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , wat@@ z@@ ke for@@ bi@@ dden ul@@ tr@@ as from playing a cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home game against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i have banned this , &quot; he explained .
the policy of zero tolerance in the field of py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been shown various ways of pun@@ ishment - they now have time to decide on a pun@@ ishment by tuesday .
otherwise , wat@@ z@@ ke says , the b@@ v@@ b will be imposing a sanc@@ tion by the end of next week .
&quot; that will be very significant &quot; , said wat@@ z@@ ke .
we can be cur@@ ious to see how the re@@ actions in the southern gallery will turn out .
p@@ f@@ and@@ houses are bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the crisis has reached the middle class , and the crisis has reached its mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class level .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in the ben@@ de@@ me@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a is ex@@ changing a golden arm , a ring and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to pay the school fees .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
although they spend 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) each month as an administrative employee and their hus@@ band also work , the monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-@@ east asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it is ex@@ changed , is now the third deposit .
ple@@ d@@ ging je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as cheap as an un@@ comfortable bank .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ houses in sing@@ apor@@ e demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % that the united over@@ seas bank requires , a local len@@ der with a fixed rate of 1 % .
however , p@@ f@@ and@@ houses have the advantage that they do not require any veri@@ fication of cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or income certific@@ ates , which makes loans faster than banks can .
that is why millions of people in the region turn to p@@ f@@ and@@ houses after families have been exposed to the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to lo@@ ose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income homes seek refu@@ ge , thus avoiding a sti@@ fl@@ ing economy .
this week , the rating agency standard &amp; poor &apos;s described the growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor in the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of asian banks .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e have , according to the agency , the highest budget debt in asia relative to gross domestic product .
mal@@ ay@@ sia is the top of the list , accounting for 80 % of gdp , a 60 % increase in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .
on thursday , the data showed that there was still a lack of exports and a fall in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the mid@@ d@@ le-@@ to-@@ lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supple@@ ment their income wherever possible , ” says song sen@@ g .
historic gold price pe@@ aks over the past two years have shown the trend towards personal ple@@ d@@ ges , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the family ’ s je@@ well@@ ery into cash .

rescue package of $ 3@@ 25 million in australia for tas@@ man health care
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions that have been met by the rescue package of over $ 3@@ 25 million in australia for tas@@ man health to ensure that the us government is fully respected .
federal minister of health t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will take “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota .
the funding for a four-@@ year period was agreed after government consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man member andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the federal state to address . ”
the $ 3@@ 25 million package of dollars en@@ tails 31 million in emergency aid for election services .
with a further 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dic sur@@ gery and treatment for gre@@ y star , resi@@ du@@ es are to be elimin@@ ated .
there is also money for day@@ clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ care after sta@@ tionary stays , which provide specialist training , services in the field of mental health and the introduction of an electronic recording system .
“ these investments cor@@ respond to the ideas that affected clin@@ ic staff told me they were the best way to improve the tas@@ man healthcare system , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on strict reporting and accountability for tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth , and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent .
a three-@@ member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that would put the tas@@ man public health system on a more sustainable course . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to its request for urgent help , which he first addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” wil@@ ki@@ e said .
according to the state government , these election benefits will largely compens@@ ate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s public health spo@@ kes@@ man , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pat@@ ch@@ work solution . ”
“ we are in the current situation because the laboratory state government has received $ 4@@ 30 million from the health system , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is not acceptable for a government to spend nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and the comm@@ on@@ wealth to put in 300 million and then pre@@ tend that the good news is good .
du@@ tt@@ on called upon p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a monitoring group , and the un security council has called for a ban on the use of nuclear weapons .
syria has important facilities for producing chemical weapons and g@@ it@@ f@@ gas@@ m@@ uni@@ tions , the global chemical monitoring group declared on thursday , while it is operating in the north of the country in severe cl@@ ash@@ es near one of the sites of the islamic republic .
on thursday , too , a sy@@ ri@@ an group of activi@@ sts announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came on the agenda one day before the date of the day before the date of the meeting on 1 january 2000 .
1 november , which the h@@ ague based organization dam@@ as@@ c@@ us had set to use all facilities for producing chemical weapons , or “ in@@ operative ” them .
the conclusion of this process , which is in fact the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable aimed at destro@@ ying all chemical weapons in syria by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
the destruction of facilities means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , must start to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .
according to estimates , there are around 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when on thursday , fi@@ ghts took place in the city of sa@@ fir@@ a , experts say that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities here , as the british residents have .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group , which , through a network of activi@@ sts in syria , has seen the number of deaths , declared on thursday that 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people had died .
6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 of them were civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
the government had 2@@ 9.@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them in the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 being pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
the dead also included 2,@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 10@@ 0,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has led some two million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting the re@@ be@@ ls in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks , many of which have links with al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the observ@@ atory said that there was a loss on thursday on both sides , but did not mention details .
the fi@@ ghts underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its tox@@ ic ar@@ sen@@ al is a race against time am@@ id a r@@ aging civil war .
according to the op@@ c@@ w , which works closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will have all the important production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities mentioned by syria and has witn@@ essed their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed the first round of the checks and that 21 out of 23 of the sites identified by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us had visited .
because of security concerns , two institutions were unable to visit , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , the op@@ wc said that the two sites had been “ abandoned ... ” according to sy@@ ri@@ an statements , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were transferred to other a@@ fore@@ mentioned facilities that were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has drawn up a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved by the executive committee of the op@@ wc next month .
“ i prefer the hat to the bra@@ very and courage that they all have in meeting the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation .
for three years now , the mostly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and security forces , which have been a large number of al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes ’ members , in the civil war .
in view of further developments , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , the head of the monitoring group , said that there was a strong explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the sy@@ ri@@ an coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion was not known , he explained .
an@@ ger at bal@@ i bom@@ bers
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people who died in 2002 at the bal@@ i bom@@ bing re@@ acted with an@@ ger at the ruling of the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who had been tried .
pa@@ te@@ k , who has been one of the most sought after people in south-@@ east asia for nearly ten years , was awarded the prize yesterday for his role in building explo@@ si@@ ves for the bom@@ bing .
he could be released after 15 years with a suspension .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was found guil@@ ty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist district of ku@@ ta , where 20@@ 2 people died , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans .
a convic@@ tion was also found in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explo@@ sive charges .
the prosecu@@ tor had demanded a life sentence , even if it was a pun@@ ishment for the man who was killed because of his reputation as a master bom@@ b buil@@ der , as well as a “ demo@@ lition man ” .
the decision has pain@@ ful mem@@ ories at june cor@@ te@@ en , a mother from per@@ th who lived her 39 years old twin bro@@ thers jan@@ e and jen@@ ny in the pa@@ te@@ k and his fellow con@@ spir@@ ators .
fighting with te@@ ars , she said that pa@@ te@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
i really do think that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; one should put him before a sho@@ oting command , &quot; cor@@ teen said to a@@ ap .
i have to live every day with no other grand@@ children and i never will see my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the sar@@ i club was equ@@ ated to the ground when a violent attack on 12 october 2002 took place shortly after 23 : 00 in a small bas@@ in that was par@@ ked in front of the night@@ club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber was killed just 20 seconds earlier , a ru@@ g filled with explo@@ si@@ ves .
he fell into com@@ a for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times while working on a life re@@ tention system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said that pa@@ te@@ k deser@@ ved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell j@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a were responsible for the blood .
indeed , this type should be given the death penalty before everyone else .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .
20 years after he killed 20@@ 2 people and in@@ ju@@ red many hundreds , is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be tried .
he es@@ cap@@ ed arrest for almost a decade , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces att@@ acked the former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief o@@ sam@@ ba .
during the negotiation , an f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that the p@@ am@@ ph@@ let in pakistan was not enough to b@@ in la@@ den to meet the target of strengthening the link between south-@@ east asian terrorist groups .
“ he has not stood up , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
until recently , he has shown no rep@@ ent@@ ance at how much suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the t@@ enth anniversary of the attack this year , which marked the beginning of comm@@ em@@ or@@ ative cere@@ mon@@ ies in bal@@ i and australia .
“ there will be many te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k may appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not make mobile phone calls ) .
passengers can now change their electronic equipment from departure to lan@@ ding for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching films , but not with the mobile phone , according to the new guidelines that will be published on thursday by aviation from thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , fa@@ a &apos;s employee michael hu@@ er@@ ta explained at a press conference .
airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the training manu@@ als of the airline staff and the regulations for sto@@ wing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to limit the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines were del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the fa@@ a announced in a statement .
at the moment , passengers have to turn off smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not re@@ start it until the aircraft reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .
when you arrive at the airport , passengers have to turn them off again and they are not allowed to re@@ start before the plane has lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safe against electronic distur@@ ban@@ ces could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , lan@@ ding and on the whe@@ el@@ field , the fa@@ a declared .
most new aircraft and other aircraft used for w@@ i fi in larger hei@@ ghts .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of professional cab@@ in crew , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regime is implemented safe@@ ly – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit , ” gl@@ ading comm@@ ented .
we are frank@@ ly sorry to feel more recep@@ tive to this issue .
however , internet connections to sur@@ f , exchange of e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained banned , explained the authority .
passengers are invited to purchase smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices in flight mode .
so still not a “ words with friends ” that res@@ emb@@ les sc@@ r@@ ab@@ ble online game , which the actor al@@ ec bal@@ d@@ win 2011 will play on his smar@@ t@@ phone when he is public@@ ity jet .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ len , as there is a danger of in@@ jury if they fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile phone calls during the flight remain banned .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( f@@ cc ) , not the fa@@ a .
fa@@ a may lift the ban on certain electronic devices on star@@ tup and lan@@ ding on certain types of electronic equipment at lan@@ ding and lan@@ ding on the aircraft .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker of the national transportation safety board , safety expert for national transport issues , said on c@@ bs news , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .
“ cell phone really is a problem , not only because they could potentially cause inter@@ ference in navigation devices , but because we know from the f@@ cc that the transmission from the air also distur@@ bs trans@@ mit@@ ter ma@@ sts ” , so .
a consulting committee of the industry , led by the fa@@ a to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the industry government set up a broader set of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , pressure has increased on the fa@@ a to ease restrictions on use .
cri@@ tics such as sen@@ ator cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ k@@ ill of mis@@ sour@@ i , a democratic sen@@ ator , argue that there is no valid reason for ban@@ ning it .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of the equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies have said that up to a third of passengers will not be able to switch off or ignore the device .
the fa@@ a began in 196@@ 6 , restric@@ ting the use of electronic equipment by air passengers , after reports of inter@@ ference in navigation and communication equipment by passengers &apos; uc@@ v radi@@ os had been published , which were then published .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built in such a way that the fa@@ a allows them to have no electronic inter@@ ference .
airlines have been offering passengers wi-fi for several years now , when the flight level is reached .
the f@@ lies adapted to wi-fi systems are also more in@@ sensitive to inter@@ ference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new guidelines , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , only give minimal radiation when you turn the page .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
those who advoc@@ ate eas@@ ing restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers are amaz@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , the company ’ s employees invited a passenger aircraft full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not detec@@ t them .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed mixed feel@@ ings about the risk of using devices .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d from the national association of airline passengers said he was of the opinion that the dis@@ ru@@ ption caused by the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pil@@ ots who are responsible for dis@@ rup@@ ting aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee , however , recommended that the fa@@ a allow pil@@ ots to take the lead in instrument lan@@ ding under bad vi@@ sibility conditions .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are today fully equipped with technology .
“ we are pleased that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience is not in@@ compatible with security , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea dr@@ illing island rescu@@ ed birds to be released again .
a water rescue service to the coast , which is de@@ ple@@ ted on a north sea bo@@ re@@ line , has been found .
the water pur@@ se was dis@@ pat@@ ched last month with a helicop@@ ter to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en , where it was used by the scot@@ tish animal welfare organisation sp@@ ca in their rescue centre in allo@@ a .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said : “ this water r@@ al was probably a winter dra@@ u@@ ght bird from northern europe , which was blo@@ wn up by the strong win@@ ds over the north sea . ”

is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who are responsible for wealth and work in britain will be changing in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we have launched the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders , asking them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v inter@@ viewed more than 1@@ ,000 business execu@@ tives , roughly the uk ’ s size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now ex@@ porting outside europe and focusing on countries that modern@@ ise and grow , while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want new trade links from the government side with countries like china , india , and brazil to be fav@@ ored , rather than bo@@ thering with the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of re@@ forming the ob@@ sc@@ ure eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from anti@@ trust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be controlled by west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , as companies said that the cost of the brussels rules would now out@@ wei@@ gh the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies tradi@@ tionally agreed to it .
finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority had taken a course of change in the agreement by the united kingdom and that a relationship with the eu based on trade is not based on politics .
this recognition , which is shared by companies of all sizes and companies of all sizes , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaning@@ ful change ” , which will bring the sti@@ t@@ ching of action back to britain .
it is a matter of a lot – a change to the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is behind his plan for the re@@ negotiation of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies will see a marked shift in power relations back to the united kingdom from a re@@ negotiation .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , now that the eurozone is moving toward closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , which means that companies must pay more attention to trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulations .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest european energy projects , as stated by the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m board .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : the construction of the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m ’ s ceo .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is said to be more diverse in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and his counter@@ parts in ukraine , where most of russia &apos;s gas is stored for europe , is a concern for increased risk of conventional gas pipel@@ ines , such as those of official authorities .
mill@@ er said the direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the links with transit countries to geo@@ political risks are “ fore@@ ver ” .
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at a reduced rate if the entire project is operational in 20@@ 15 .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is limited to an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca employees war@@ ned of acc@@ us@@ ations against jon@@ a@@ than lord for sexual off@@ ences .
two y@@ m@@ ca employees from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) have been arrested for sexual off@@ ences related to children before being accused of off@@ ences against the care@@ r jon@@ a@@ than lor@@ d in 2011 .
however , in the opening statement to the commission , the y@@ m@@ ca said that ‘ you never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ .
managing director phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was asked about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was convic@@ ted of child por@@ no@@ graphy off@@ ences and another , in which a sports teacher was the y@@ m@@ ca .
h@@ are said ga@@ il fur@@ ness , a law@@ yer assi@@ sting the commission , knew about the first case , but not the second .
he ad@@ mitted that he had already made the opening declaration of the y@@ m@@ ca to the commission in the statement that ‘ there have been external checks of the y@@ m@@ ca , in which the y@@ m@@ ca was considered to be the front line .
evidence to the commission shows that the y@@ m@@ ca has been informed that it is the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education .
h@@ are , who started with 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , ad@@ mitted that the management had “ down@@ wards from me ” in the recru@@ it@@ ment of lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations .
lord was convic@@ ted of sexual off@@ ences at twelve bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year activity for the y@@ m@@ ca at the beginning of the year .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
har@@ e st@@ rit@@ t ab@@ solved that the y@@ m@@ ca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting murder violations in respect of the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including that lord had been alone with children , was a baby boy in private .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief lord was and who was asked to take a child protection training course because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the child service providers were not able to attend the training .
the managing director said he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have d@@ ared to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se their superi@@ ors .
instead , he said , their friend@@ ship with lord has affected their jud@@ g@@ ement , which is why they did not report it .
he explained that he had given the board of the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w his view that the lesson that the organization had learned from the “ jon@@ a@@ than lord incident ” was not a simple one .
h@@ are said that the decision to brief employees for signing confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the acc@@ us@@ ations was made was taken by the director of the children &apos;s services of the y@@ m@@ ca , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this should prevent the evidence from being contam@@ inated , but this is ‘ over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ’ and badly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was born in the time when jon@@ a@@ than lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , and was not a safe organisation for children , professor ste@@ ph@@ en small@@ bone of gri@@ ff@@ ith university explained .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in recru@@ iting , re@@ viewing , processing , training , and supervis@@ ing staff .
the hearing was postpon@@ ed until 20 december .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir said he would se@@ ize the opportunity to return as british prime minister – but ad@@ mits that a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview ton@@ ight on the fifth anniversary of his exit from office , the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since its re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , bla@@ ir has largely avoided speaking out about british policy , and his comments have mostly been directed at foreign policy and its role as en@@ vo@@ y of the quar@@ tet .
in answer to the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , bla@@ ir was quo@@ ted by the london evening standard as saying , ‘ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen ... ’
when the horse show experts in dro@@ ves found their way into car@@ di@@ ff to shor@@ ten the horse of the year , they re@@ alised that a fi@@ er@@ ce competition was im@@ minent .
but no one was able to prepare for the three-@@ year-@@ old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , which is not even in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only a few months ago , did its first steps , and its sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee ran through the first three roun@@ ds and won the first 30 roun@@ ds .
the in@@ separ@@ able pair , both equal in size , were not removed due to their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition , which was e@@ rec@@ ted by the sun@@ ny@@ bank equ@@ e@@ strian centre in ru@@ dry near car@@ di@@ ff .
he was a member of the royal society of the united states of america , and was a member of the united states of america .
f@@ ent@@ on was chosen by the jury for his natural skills in handling the pon@@ y , which la@@ sts well above his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received best marks for his appearance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift for his third birth@@ day and since then have been bar@@ gaining with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great sp@@ an . ”
they had to compete against the entire field and are equipped with gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he participated in a competition with to@@ ff@@ ee and we were all ex@@ ci@@ ted when he won .
he was considered by the most str@@ ang@@ ers in the arena to be so phenomen@@ al that he wanted to be photograph@@ ed with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near eb@@ b@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ wel@@ ls , who have been leading horses for more than ten years .
ho@@ well said : “ the entire audience was elec@@ tri@@ fied and everyone fi@@ red and cla@@ pped him . ”
he ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy about animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens he ca@@ res about .
as it is started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure he will do well .
one speaker of the annual horse show said : “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury jud@@ ged f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee how well they be@@ aten themselves and presented them in the demonstration ring .
they look for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leaders – and here f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s swe@@ et@@ ness has played its part in making this a perfect occasion .
after calling it “ re@@ formed ” , china ’ s newspaper is said to be “ re@@ formed ”
a chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a re@@ porter charged with de@@ fam@@ ation , should be re@@ formed .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u new express had a rare public call to release the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to report a sub-@@ state company .
now the new express will be subject to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” the regul@@ ator declared .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong .
preliminary investigations have shown that the new express , which leads to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , will be available between september 2012 and august 2013 for several in@@ accurate reports on the listed company .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ organised , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that they decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to grant him his re@@ porter ’ s license . ”
in addition , “ the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group has been instruc@@ ted to provide a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and to recommend that the relevant persons responsible for the new express be identified and immediately contact the new express management team . ”
chen had written several articles for the new express , in which he reported alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and backed his journalists to write a letter of formal notice .
but then chen appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he had published false reports against payment .
“ in this case , i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion , as have the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he declared to the state news station c@@ c@@ tv .
i did so primarily because i was looking for money and gl@@ ory .
i realise that i have acted wr@@ ong@@ ly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express published an apo@@ logy on the front page , saying that it failed to read the reports correctly .
several well-known susp@@ ects have recently made conf@@ essions on television .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely forced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to acc@@ use themselves .
drug tunnel with its own railway network between the usa and mexico
one of the most refined tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered by lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric rail operation , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the tun@@ nels measuring 120 times 90 cen@@ ti@@ metres as one of the most sophisticated pass@@ ages they would ever have found .
the tunnel , which is in the zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag pattern , stret@@ ching nearly six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ imag@@ in@@ able storage h@@ alls in the area , which makes it easier to hide tr@@ uc@@ ks loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was closed before drugs could be trans@@ ported un@@ detec@@ ted in it , the authorities declared .
eight in@@ ches were taken into account when the tunnel was discovered and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were obtained , according to the records of the court .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were convic@@ ted of having ownership and selling mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with prison sent@@ ences of ten years or so .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers rely on an extensive underground network of dra@@ in@@ age channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been discovered in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were built after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico in october , which challenges the drug car@@ te@@ ls to quickly bring their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities found a pass@@ age of less than 6@@ 40 meters long with rail@@ s , which could be used from a kitchen in a residential house in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

according to the le@@ x@@ icon , ve@@ gan@@ ism is sub@@ ordin@@ ated to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but it is quite different from it .
because while vege@@ tari@@ ans are prepared to eat cre@@ am , ice or a strong ed@@ am , they are not prepared to eat any of the ta@@ sty meals .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the absence of meat and fish , the ve@@ gan leaves all animal products to be consum@@ ed - even hon@@ ey is denied .
what remains , one might wonder , but on closer inspection , the ve@@ gan food world is characterized by a considerable ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , the owner of the local re@@ form@@ ist house , who has produced a variety of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the shop in the cathedral street .
for 13 years , ve@@ gan , born in new ze@@ al@@ and , has been living in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im ( almost ) all he needs for life . &quot; in 1997 , i changed my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; but the convic@@ tion came not only because of the di@@ et , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proc@@ tor , who pre@@ fers artificial leather normal leather .
he realized that there are also other everyday concerns without animal products .
ve@@ gan is primarily an eth@@ ics .
&quot; i don &apos;t want animals to die for me , &quot; proc@@ tor spe@@ aks out the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans , which covers all consumption behavior .
instead of bur@@ gers , ag@@ it@@ ators or rubber bears , ve@@ gan ve@@ gan quickly got new products , which were inspired by the enthusiasm .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; says proc@@ tor today , &quot; in fact , ve@@ gan is not a wai@@ ver , an as@@ c@@ end@@ ance , but rather an en@@ rich@@ ment &quot; .
and it was these conditions that led some people , even though they were meant to do so , to fail .
&quot; ad@@ diction is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor makes a comparison .
and applies one : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not to be se@@ ized on the animal &quot; .
often it is the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make the taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains ve@@ g@@ ans .
for example , proc@@ tor brings e@@ gg@@ plant , mus@@ h@@ rooms and some ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages to a bar@@ bec@@ ue .
it is a balanced , varied di@@ et , with a good taste for it .
of course , one wants to have something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
health problems , including eating dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption , did not suffer .
for me , the conversion had a positive aspect .
i do not take up any foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and i have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance buildings exclusively dedicated to ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check &quot; , says proc@@ tor .
in particular , the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 is a warning to many ve@@ gan si@@ mu@@ sts .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , rather than gr@@ ass on the pa@@ st@@ ure , it is doub@@ t@@ ful whether in the meat that you buy in the ch@@ est , the vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 percentage is high .
ve@@ g@@ ans also have the option of using the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
pro@@ c@@ tor must not go far in the way of food procurement .
after all , basic food@@ stuffs are everywhere , and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
i find everything i need on the ground .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products are known to be &quot; .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than is commonly assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen of the house there is much to discover , with a few small tr@@ ic@@ ks you can achieve good , if not partially better results , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with its ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ kes , proc@@ tor was able to ast@@ on@@ ish his fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful parents .
family celebra@@ tions give the ve@@ gan a new sp@@ ice .
this has dynam@@ ism when you co@@ ok together , it has a new meaning .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
but , of course , he has already been s@@ cep@@ tical .
do you not like my food any@@ more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - in such cases , one should ask as a ve@@ gan with a fing@@ er@@ tip .
&quot; i don &apos;t reject people , i &apos;m part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to set an enc@@ la@@ ve .
and , more precisely , everyday life doesn ’ t seem as ve@@ gan as susp@@ ected - and ve@@ g@@ ans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes are everywhere !
&quot; many d@@ ö@@ ner shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , it is different from pa@@ sta dishes , or it is just a piz@@ za without cheese , all a matter of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are so slowly setting themselves up for it .
&quot; when i started to eat ve@@ gan 13 years ago , things were much more difficult &quot; , the new ze@@ al@@ and can find a development : &quot; you have to deal with people , you have to draw them to it &quot; .
&quot; if there are enough requests , they may be temp@@ ted to add to the menu , &quot; he hopes .
ve@@ gan restaurants develop , such as the man@@ n@@ heim com@@ b or the café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor wants other restaurants to have at least a ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are there for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way of preventing most of the things from being done in advance , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
however , purchasing ve@@ gan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .
especially when one lear@@ ns to understand that animal addi@@ tives are also used in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts as colour@@ ants , one seems to be satisfied with the eth@@ ics of so many hur@@ d@@ les and tr@@ aps quickly .
not only for this reason , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients , the food and also the cleaning agents .
&quot; gradually you develop a scan@@ ner view and know what characters and lo@@ gos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than stop or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; , proc@@ tor knows .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er , which points to consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to dis@@ miss his hab@@ its , but at least he can te@@ ach consumers to cri@@ tically question their hab@@ its .

kon@@ stan@@ z : cy@@ cli@@ sts from 63 years old
according to the police , the accident happened when a 26 year old man was killed on thursday evening , at 10 p.m. , with a women &apos;s bicycle .
when a 63 year old man suddenly came down from a local road , the cy@@ c@@ list could not stop the cy@@ c@@ list in time .
the following col@@ li@@ sion was followed by a pede@@ strian pus@@ hing the house wall , then later on , went to the ground and pul@@ led a 15@@ -@@ in@@ ch long squ@@ ee@@ ge@@ e on the head .

british police are making ass@@ ange a delivery decision to the united kingdom .
the british police have today sent a request for ex@@ tradition to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who is in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london seeking refu@@ ge and applying for asylum .
scot@@ land yard said that it was given a “ call to join the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an , ” which led him to appear in a police station , and added that he should be unable to do so .
ass@@ ange is threatened with ex@@ tradition to sweden for charges of sexual off@@ ence after his possibilities for british law have been exhaus@@ ted .
as he fears that stockholm will hand him over to the united states , he had a very strong case in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london on 19 june and asked the south american country for political asylum .
scot@@ land yard was “ a 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man who was asked to sign up to a police station at a time we chose , ” one speaker said .
he continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .
ass@@ ange fears that he will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted from sweden to the united states and will be prosecu@@ ted there for possible sp@@ ying charges , after having received over 2@@ 50@@ ,000 diplomatic messages on the dis@@ closure website wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks .

after the police stopped him , they discovered the be@@ verage cu@@ be between his leg@@ s .
in the col@@ ch@@ ester court , ho@@ wi@@ e ow@@ ed himself to be guil@@ ty without having taken the necessary care and attention .
he received seven points and a six@@ -@@ month driving ban .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury has provi@@ sion@@ ally calculated the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of chancell@@ or george os@@ borne , who was in the 2012 budget to set a st@@ amp tax of $ 1.@@ 50 billion .
already now , revenue from the st@@ amp tax on housing in west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea districts is already exce@@ eding the tax revenue of 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds in 2012 / 13 .
co@@ ok said : “ after the ste@@ m@@ pel tax increases on high-@@ price housing and the introduction of the related legislation , it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are too low to be tax@@ ed , regardless of the impact of the general tax .
“ but this move could make some foreign investors more re@@ stra@@ ined about buying real estate in london , or dis@@ cour@@ aged owners , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – is located in the weal@@ thy south-@@ west bel@@ t of london , which stret@@ ches from ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don .
central london &apos;s prices showed a stead@@ y annual growth of 5.@@ 6 % , but were driven by an emerging “ domestic market ” .
scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the context in which a dog &apos;s tail sw@@ ings are related to its mo@@ od .
previous research has shown that happy dogs with the tail we@@ ed more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while there are ner@@ vous dogs on the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs per@@ cei@@ ve these sub@@ tle differences and can respond to them .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st at the university of tren@@ to , said : “ in man , it is well known that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimul@@ i that pro@@ vo@@ ke positive or negative . ”
we tried to look at this from other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have a right brain half for the movement of the left and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res have different roles in the emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side to@@ w of their species , the researchers supervis@@ ed the animals while the animals were watching other dogs .
they measure the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged pe@@ ts and analy@@ zed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the co@@ ck is getting into one direction , sometimes in the other .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have shown dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to be able to show di@@ str@@ acting other aspects , and we were able to do so .
if the animals saw an otherwise un@@ prin@@ table dog pus@@ hing the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the swe@@ eping dog ) , they were left completely relaxed .
but was the pro@@ pen@@ sity to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that we@@ ars ) , their heart rate rose and they saw an@@ no@@ ying .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a says that dogs do not deliber@@ ately communicate with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience , in which movements they should worry about and when not .
he said : “ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and w@@ av@@ ing with the tail in one direction is more connected to friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce a less friendly behavior , you respond on the basis of these experiences .
researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veter@@ in@@ arians and co@@ aches help to better understand the emo@@ tions of their animal .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , an expert in dog behavior and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of animal medicine at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether links were left .
last year , a team from l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n university found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they watch an aggres@@ sive dog , and right if they were a satisfied dog .
in another research at the university of victori@@ a in canada , the following was stated : “ dogs tend to go to a robo@@ t dog if his tail is we@@ aring links and not right , rather than be an@@ no@@ ying .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore ar@@ ou@@ se that the dogs in the various studies the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs did not interpre@@ t as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ while there is considerable evidence for many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two hal@@ ves of the brain are used for various purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said br@@ ad@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ .
however , since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes turns into one , sometimes in the other direction .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points the first car@@ din@@ als in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be presenting new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church on 22 february , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe and they are also the ones who choose a po@@ pe , so that franc@@ is is thus the first group of men .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the po@@ pe election – that is to say a group of 120 “ eligible car@@ din@@ als ” .
in a statement announ@@ cing the news , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a speaker of the v@@ ati@@ can , said that there would be a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als before the cere@@ mony was held .
“ po@@ pe franc@@ is decided to re@@ consider his decision to conven@@ e the february history of consensus in advance , so that others who want to avoid kar@@ din@@ a@@ e@@ lic participation from around the world can be planned . ”
j@@ ack val@@ ero of catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als is likely to fall by february .
he said that a po@@ pe usually ap@@ point as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to reduce the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als to 120 , and so many car@@ din@@ als over 80 , as he would like .
next year &apos;s consistency is significant because it is the first since the election of franc@@ is in march of this year , according to val@@ ero .
there is currently a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the new po@@ pe car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world will ap@@ point to restore the balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty percent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be used since the formation of the kar@@ din@@ ä@@ le council , founded by franc@@ is , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world who have the order .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything on its own .
&quot; now franc@@ is has chosen these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; said val@@ ero .
he said that it was “ possible ” that franc@@ is had to ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but , all things considered , we have not been able to do so .
val@@ ero said that typically the bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places are called car@@ din@@ als , but they are st@@ uck in fran@@ z@@ is@@ k@@ us “ full of surpris@@ es – so we do not know who he ap@@ points . ”

obama ’ s cr@@ y of desper@@ ation
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .
he says that obama has made comm@@ end@@ able efforts to break down the republic@@ ans ’ bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics .
the bloc@@ king policy does not exc@@ use the ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website problems , the dr@@ one attacks and the threat of violence against women .
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad remin@@ der of what might have been possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student at the har@@ v@@ ard medical school for the second year .
i am reading a terri@@ bly sad book at the moment .
it is a book i thought would be a book that would make me feel at home during the ble@@ ak second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .
it is called “ the aud@@ acity to win ” and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack obama ’ s presidential election .
when i finish the evening with my patient records and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and gave the bre@@ ath of a speech .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory , and news spo@@ kes@@ men held to defend the historic significance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on their way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama joined office in 2008 , he had agreed 82 % .
and then i close the book .
swit@@ ching back to the present is a bad awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you were being tor@@ n out of a dream .
it is hard to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad remin@@ der of missed opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , something has actually changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things that obama has achieved , from the adoption of the aff@@ ord@@ able care act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the arch@@ bis@@ hop &apos;s life .
i agree that the party political bloc@@ k@@ ade too many attempts are being made to break down our nation &apos;s path .
but , having repeatedly critic@@ ised the obama administration to colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i have come to the end of my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to allow foreign leaders to inter@@ cep@@ t or to stop killing inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has collected data on american privacy and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower is pun@@ ished , the state &apos;s mis@@ conduct is revealed .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , a us citizen , was mur@@ dered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were being exce@@ eded during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the white house &apos;s efforts to calm the media are the &apos; most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government &apos; .
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to make a living in more than three years since the adoption of the aff@@ ord@@ able care act .
i do not know whether that is what i should have expected .
i should have understood , at 18 , that the work of government could have contradic@@ ted the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and ran@@ dom events like the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re shape public debate .
but if i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that bo@@ thers me most .
i re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusi@@ astic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and un@@ sophisticated alternative , he seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with obama ’ s approval rating falling to below 45 % this week , this book has made it all the har@@ der to return to 2008 .
it awa@@ k@@ ens in me the long@@ ing for the many promises that have dis@@ appeared into air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how obama could make a heavy loss against clin@@ ton in pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania ’ s pre-@@ election po@@ lls .
in a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr president , i could not agree more with you .

cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has had a conflict of interests during paren@@ tal leave
mr pal@@ mer , the bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and mr ab@@ bot@@ t , says that prime minister ab@@ bot@@ t is in conflict of interests in his plans for paren@@ tal leave because his dau@@ gh@@ ters could become pregn@@ ant and therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , who was in a court dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , claimed that when he asked questions about it he would be thro@@ wn away .
the pal@@ mer united party could control up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important in deci@@ ding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters would benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because if one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets holiday , ” said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , the electoral commission , with 53 votes , declared pal@@ mer to be the official winner of the sun@@ shine coast seat of fair@@ fax .
pal@@ mer called for a revision of the voting coun@@ ting process so that it could proceed more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
if these elections were to be decided two months after the vote was ended ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why not have a system where you go in , send the data into a computer , choose and then click 6 : 30 .
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of p@@ enc@@ ils when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
if you use them , because you can er@@ ase the results if you don &apos;t like them ?
to vote with p@@ enc@@ ils today is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , declared that his policy was to have an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast and that he had to “ take his new office very seriously . ”
a public office is about serving the public .
“ we are not seeking re@@ ward except for history , namely that we serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two currency trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has two trad@@ ers from its fore@@ x department suspended , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the bank of scotland ’ s global authorities are being investig@@ ated as the alleg@@ ed measures .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank and r@@ bs , confirmed that they had co@@ operated with the authorities in the investigation of the world ’ s largest financial market , which is changing 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion dollars a day .
the two re@@ tail@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that has been followed by the scand@@ al surrounding the lib@@ or inter@@ banking business .
the bank , which does not comment on the suspension , confirmed this month that it will receive information requests from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are fully co@@ operating with the f@@ ca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation indicated that r@@ bs had not yet received the records of e-@@ ma@@ ils and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to a former trad@@ er to the british supervisory authority , the financial con@@ du@@ it .
this trad@@ er , richard us@@ her , had left the r@@ bs 2010 and is now expected to leave his current position as european leader of the fore@@ x spot trade at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of european spot trading at cit@@ i , was vac@@ ated this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly the chief currency trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was named this week at standard .
none of these deal@@ ers has been accused of any mis@@ conduct .
to the inst@@ ant message group of us@@ her , ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group said to the people close to the situation .
u@@ bs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that they had committed alleg@@ ed man@@ ip@@ ulation of the currency market in a number of swiss banks investig@@ ated .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently dealing with alleg@@ ations that the government is not doing so .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar persons .
banks pass inst@@ ant messages and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years in search of cases of mis@@ conduct .
the news of these investigations has left trad@@ ers in a sector that has been at the fore@@ front of the economy in recent years , becoming one of the most prof@@ itable trading units of investment banks , but this year under pressure from low vo@@ la@@ tility because of low prices .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air and said that it is almost impossible to avoid the vast and highly liquid currency market .
a leading trad@@ er noticed that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms has led to this by banks .
the news came out the same day when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that she had sent a re@@ tail@@ er of her london exchange tr@@ aded funds office this week after he had received a loss of just under $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the trad@@ er has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said credit su@@ is@@ se .
the construction f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ le p@@ lot pain@@ ts the building f@@ ence on the p@@ lot .
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss me@@ ado@@ w &quot; has installed the f@@ ence on the bec@@ h@@ le p@@ lot on the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
it also clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , it says in a press release .
the planned cover of the dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ing house in the re@@ ar part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened to sli@@ de .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the property , had launched the beauti@@ fication action with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action was a transparent with the message &apos; we have been in favour &apos; .
this distur@@ bed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their actions .
her mo@@ tto on the big pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against ru@@ ins &quot; .
in this way , it was prepared to point out the danger of even larger ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - if the giant project one day fails .
in con@@ vers@@ ation with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by in front of the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the re@@ alization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the bi presented .
but they begin to re@@ sign@@ ate because the city is further dela@@ ying these responses , it is said by the bi .
as we heard , the public statements by the may@@ or have also had an impact .
may said at the local council meeting that he would not be afraid of this for the thermal bath , if the population were to vote against plans for bathing and wellness facilities on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w .
some people seem , therefore , fri@@ ghten@@ ed , others feel they are &quot; cru@@ de attempts at black@@ mail &quot; of the population , says the bi press release .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all help@@ ers .

recent reason for ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s criticism was yellow for man@@ e at the 3-@@ 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , in which the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese had a supposed ac@@ tress become a fat@@ al act - which , however , was no .
&quot; a star@@ k mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , the re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am called &quot; totally over@@ stret@@ ched &quot; .

in view of the success , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a p@@ raise .
&quot; there are only two words : right , &quot; he said .
there is not much to say .
the way the team plays is particularly impressive .

there are no great reasons to change anything .

supreme court confir@@ ms obama ’ s health law
it is a big victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court today decided that the bar@@ ack obama administration ’ s heal@@ th-@@ care act , closely linked to bar@@ ack obama , is constitutional .
by five to four votes , the jud@@ ges jud@@ ged that the individual mandate of the patient protection and aff@@ ord@@ able care act – it forces us citizens to reach a health insurance policy by 20@@ 14 or pay a penalty .
john ro@@ ber@@ ts , chief judge , si@@ de@@ lined the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to , and ken@@ ne@@ dy decided against it .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages law and also stated that the target of health law to be applied by states to either termin@@ ate or termin@@ ate access conditions for medic@@ aid .
the case against the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was en@@ acted by all the leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the event@@ ual challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 2012 pre-@@ election campaign .

post hardly leaves on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for sunday le@@ tting are still at various letter boxes of the city centre and the districts that are located , but you can read the small print at the yellow pages .
a request from the f@@ dp confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and public holidays , only a few minutes before the post office building in ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stras@@ se 36 and in j@@ ak@@ ob@@ -@@ m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stras@@ se 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d are emp@@ ti@@ ed .

the german social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man of the f@@ dp , fr@@ it@@ z ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make a re@@ tro@@ spec@@ tive effort here .
sunday cle@@ aring is an important postal service .
&quot; this is the only way to make this venture more radical , despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 . &quot;
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , group chairman and city chairman of the liberal group , supports his group colleagues : &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that k@@ lam@@ m@@ ste@@ in@@ berg has changed or even deleted the le@@ tting times &apos; .
the post office is a long way from being close to the citizens .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the ne@@ us@@ ch@@ los@@ se and rose garden must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days &quot; , says bit@@ t@@ ner and ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city is also considered to be the city centre , and especially not mobile citizens , should be able to reach a mail@@ box with sunday le@@ tting on foot .
ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k asked the city council whether the city council plans to talk to the post about this matter .

the aim is to increase parking fees by 50 percent .

the el@@ ders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team .
soon , however , it became apparent that they were also able to cope with the rapid actions of fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt .
with the hard and placed sur@@ charges , the go@@ n@@ inger made themselves extremely difficult .
they repeatedly missed out on the new training programmes , which were developed by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z , and were involved in bloc@@ k@@ resistance .

it gives every citizen the opportunity to set his own acc@@ ents in nature .
the ecological consideration can also be taken into account with the tourist aspect .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed for nor@@ tel patents
the group that holds thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents made an av@@ al@@ an@@ che of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that is involved in the in@@ solv@@ ency proceedings .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that holds nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed sam@@ sung electronics for its commitment to the market .
ro@@ ck@@ star is owned by apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents relate to technology that combines search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , so the compla@@ int that this puts at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star were not directly accessible .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c are mobile phones that are and@@ ro@@ id , the operating system of google , which is in sharp competition with apple &apos;s and microsoft &apos;s mobile products .
in 2011 , google issued an initial bid of $ 9@@ 00 million for nor@@ tel patents .
google has increased its offer several times and recently offered $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
after the nor@@ tel patents won over ro@@ ck@@ star , google won the mobil@@ it@@ y-@@ for@@ -@@ 12@@ ,@@ 5 billion dollars , a business that also partly mat@@ ched by motor@@ ola ’ s library of patents .
“ although google failed in its attempt to protect the patent li@@ ti@@ gation at the au@@ ction , google vio@@ lated the patents and continues to do so , ” says the law@@ suit .
ro@@ ck@@ star demands a high compensation from google , because it claims that google &apos;s patent infringement is deliber@@ ate , so the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt s@@ wor@@ e first freely elected presidents
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is aband@@ oning the o@@ ath of office , but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph should not mean the end of political disputes in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thereby ending the country ’ s succ@@ ession of ho@@ s@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak , who had been in power for 16 months .
with his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation in the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si was also the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y about 60 years ago .
he put the o@@ ath before the 18 jud@@ ges of the court dres@@ sed in black ro@@ bes , who are sitting on the n@@ ile and are re@@ plic@@ ating an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si during the cere@@ mony broad@@ cast live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy , and stability , ” said mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old engine@@ er trained in the us and a member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guards guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si arrived in the city shortly after 11 o &apos;@@ clock in a small car con@@ vo@@ y .
only a few hundred sup@@ porters had gathered in the court to re@@ jo@@ ice with the new president , and , unlike the presidential wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal tri@@ um@@ ph from the mu@@ bar@@ ak period , the traffic was only stopped for a short time so that the car would be crow@@ ded .

rap@@ ist in south africa : two li@@ fel@@ ong de@@ tention
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was condemned twice on friday .
the trans@@ mit@@ ter sab@@ c reported this .
the victim had died later from the consequences of the serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was already guil@@ ty at the beginning of the week of the crime .
the act had caused hor@@ ror across the country .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial site in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
14 hours of the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of young people was so app@@ alling that the care@@ rs and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical support .
k@@ ana ad@@ mitted during the process that he had to go to a bar at the night of the day .
he also conf@@ essed to be@@ aten and rap@@ ed them , but he denied that he was responsible for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed several perpe@@ tr@@ ators , but they released two susp@@ ects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the public prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that k@@ ana was alone at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is a common oc@@ curren@@ ce in south africa : every year there are about 64 000 indic@@ ations of sexual violence .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it has a population of 82 million , and a population of 82 million people , which is significantly more than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women ’ s associations in south africa es@@ timate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times .
jum@@ bo visits the black forest ham
jum@@ bo looking for the &quot; best ham of the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galile@@ o &quot; , pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf visited .
the speaker makes it clear right at the beginning : the most important thing for the ham is the pi@@ g cul@@ l , tur@@ bom@@ ast is not a good pre@@ requisite .
can ham you get in any super@@ market , that is , a quality product ?
ul@@ i , the head of the large ham factory in the black forest , explains jum@@ bo the way the company &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; is operating in bon@@ n@@ dorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo announced to the black forest ham .
only with hair protection and kit@@ tel it comes into the interior of the factory .
jum@@ bo must also dis@@ inf@@ ect his hands before he gets to the micro@@ phone .
jum@@ bo for strengthening with fast sn@@ ack in wal@@ d@@ sh@@ ut .
&quot; i am working on ri@@ dic@@ ulous amounts here , &quot; the television makers , black forests ham mar@@ vel as a mass product .
16@@ ,000 k@@ eu@@ len per week speak for themselves .
weight , f@@ at content , color : ul@@ i explains what quality matters .
most pi@@ gs are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months .
television with a standard ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i &apos;m cur@@ ious if your ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co measures what happens then &quot; , jum@@ bo cy@@ n@@ ical .
here the level of private television is presented in a pure culture .
but watching is still wor@@ th@@ while .
the vie@@ wer sees that the disman@@ t@@ ling of the cul@@ ls is still hand@@ cra@@ fted .
because : black forests ham is tradi@@ tionally found on the shel@@ f without b@@ ones .
the secret of the ham is the sp@@ ice mix@@ ture with the salt .
the tower of smo@@ ke and smo@@ ke hum@@ i@@ di@@ fication res@@ em@@ ble a sub@@ marine vis@@ ually .
the tr@@ ick : p@@ ine branches provide here in the smo@@ ke for the special taste of black forest ham .
20 days in the smo@@ ke , the ham finally makes almost black .
&quot; now the screen dis@@ appears in the jum@@ bo &quot; , he announ@@ ces the test fe@@ eding .
&quot; he is really delicious &quot; , says the conclusion of the tv star .
this will be a living thing for all parties involved .
they thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and exp@@ ects record income from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now assum@@ ing a adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $ 3@@ 25 and 3@@ 40 million , compared to $ 30@@ 5 to 3@@ 15 million in its earlier forec@@ ast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means a growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved eight percent profit and achieved a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in australia and the uk .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he said .
this includes australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ nings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , which made it possible to have a slightly weak@@ er business travel market .
it was similarly good for the flight centre leisure business in the uk , while here , too , business customers spend less .
the us business reco@@ vered from the seas@@ on@@ ally weak@@ er first half of the year , so that for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year , a profit is expected for the full year .
the shares of flight centre increased by 3 c@@ ents to 3@@ 8.@@ 20 dollars yesterday .
schools will become more focused on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar .
in english literature courses , students will have to learn at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic po@@ e@@ try , and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 .
the ex@@ am also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to encourage wider reading .
the combined course of english literature and language will be abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 , students must take an independent g@@ c@@ se language test , with strong incentives to use english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will be publishing the new cur@@ ricul@@ a for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics tomorrow – the first subjects rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other key subjects will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qu@@ al , the audit supervisory authority , will propose a re@@ organisation of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ot@@ y@@ ping system and less price work .
in a summer speech , the minister for education michael go@@ ve said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ zing that g@@ c@@ ses would “ challenge ” .
studies show that in english schools less time is spent on mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .
australia &apos;s schools , on the other hand , te@@ ach 14@@ 3 hours a year and students in sing@@ apor@@ e receive 13@@ 8 hours .
there will be no formal requirement to spend more time on mathem@@ a@@ tics in the timetable , but coalition cir@@ cles say that the comprehensive mathem@@ a@@ tical test – combined with a stronger degree of weigh@@ ting of the subject in terms of its importance – is being encouraged .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems of the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of inter@@ views
at the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum on monday , october 21 , in the new museum of the castle , we will talk about the topic &quot; to hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations on how to deal with the last things today &quot; .
speaker is professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and ev@@ angel@@ ical church municip@@ alities of sal@@ em , the castle sal@@ em and the k@@ ul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes bo@@ den@@ see district .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look at the question of how people are today going to classi@@ fy the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had known too much of this over the past centuries , and had put on those images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l , &quot; which have shaped our ideas to date &quot; , the contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic teaching is drawing from the sun .
&quot; the greater hope is christi@@ ans and christi@@ ans , driven by the religious critique , &quot; says the speaker .
she &apos; provided us with so many question marks that the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation marks seem to have dis@@ appeared &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner goes on to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death . &quot;
this raises the question of the long@@ ing , &apos; which dreams of everything being good in the end &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den in 196@@ 2 , studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy at the al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs university fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she gradu@@ ated in 1997 with a doc@@ tor@@ ate in fre@@ i@@ burg , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ f@@ ä@@ lis@@ che wil@@ hel@@ m@@ s-@@ uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ ä@@ t .
since 2010 , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has been teaching systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology of the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the kle@@ in@@ en heu@@ berg confirm their faith in the company in the company of the company .
in two services of wor@@ ship , 10@@ 1 15 and 16 year-@@ old te@@ en@@ ag@@ ers of the sa@@ il@@ or ’ s unit at the kle@@ in@@ en heu@@ berg have been named .
the morning was accompanied by the lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si group , the youth cho@@ ir the spirit in the afternoon .
with the reception of the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent , the young said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings have been working in the past months under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er de@@ h@@ ner and the help of many local members for the great fe@@ ast day .
in various projects they learned various tasks of christian community life and together experienced youth day in un@@ ter@@ mach@@ t valley .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race will in@@ sp@@ ire participants with a lot of enthusiasm .
in fine weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to complete the round course across the h@@ ill@@ top cha@@ ins around the lake .
this is shared by ul@@ rich kno@@ bel from the organiz@@ ing sport@@ vere@@ in ill@@ men@@ see .
among the participants were , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of al@@ titude , many everyone cy@@ cli@@ sts who once put their ho@@ b@@ by in a competitive atmosphere .
two top german junior drivers were also at the start of this race : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came to the top of the german championship with the recommendation .
these two were able to dis@@ connect from the field as expected .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er was able to save a small time to the finish and def@@ ended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .
in the second place , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was again able to place himself in the top position .
in the ladies it was the@@ res@@ a du@@ ell@@ i of the team night@@ m@@ are that made it to the top of the winning sta@@ dium .
in second and third places anne a@@ del came from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from o@@ w@@ ingen .
a positive development is the increasing number of drivers living in the community or working in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of sport@@ sm@@ en and women was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youn@@ g@@ est to over 70 years at the oldest star@@ ters .
in the main race , more absolute top@@ bra@@ tes were on the start this year .
four drivers were able to get away from the top regional drivers .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi-@@ professional mountain bike from the black@@ -@@ tus@@ k-@@ racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l and a team member have already won the 12@@ -@@ hour world champi@@ on twice .
this year he was european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already won two german championship tit@@ les in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , is also one of them .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a wh@@ im@@ per final was reached before the tri@@ -@@ lakes hal@@ le .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to cross the finish line .
only a second behind it was the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt able to secure second place in the overall rating .
at the same time , her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann came to the finish as the third of the overall ran@@ king .
in the women &apos;s ran@@ king , christi@@ ane co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test in the main race .
the second place was won by are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from b@@ ing@@ er@@ bread in front of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-@@ organised way the event went .
on the way through mu@@ d , rivers and jun@@ g@@ les for free health care
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le provides free medical assistance to remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend nearly every weekend tre@@ ating hundreds of patients , and they are the only ones who have the right to care for their patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5@@ ,000 people , but one for 5@@ ,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile phone .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can go to the top 10 for him or one of the other her@@ oes to make him the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le was watching his si@@ ck father again and again lo@@ ose consci@@ ousness and travell@@ ed to hospit@@ als that did not have the means to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was born in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ de , the capital of camer@@ o@@ on .
first , he had only a broken arm , but then an infl@@ am@@ mation was formed , which was spread to his brain and where a hem@@ at@@ om caused a damage to him for the rest of his life .
“ there were no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we would have brought him out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years in over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als , helping his father to get treatment there that she had to offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments b@@ wel@@ le .
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ well &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor per 5 000 people , according to the world health organisation .
in contrast , in the united states , the ratio is between a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most camer@@ am@@ en could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem they have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered in b@@ wel@@ le , which decided to do anything about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team performed 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ é .
he also founded a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which trav@@ els to rural areas on week@@ ends and offers free medical care there .
since 2008 he and his volunte@@ er group have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into mini@@ buses and travel with the finished medical equipment on the roof over un@@ ti@@ ghten@@ ed ter@@ rain into the villages that need help .
not everything is always going smo@@ o@@ thly .
they have already had to push the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d more than once .
but when they arrive they will receive like her@@ oes : a ban@@ quet , sing@@ ing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wel@@ le – with its wide sm@@ ile and limit@@ less energy – is happy to attend the happy celebr@@ ation .
the next morning the team will start stu@@ dying hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per trip ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
they come from a 60 km radi@@ us around the village – and that on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being tor@@ tured because of mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites , and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others get cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple sur@@ gery with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
the operations are normally carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the procedure , the patients are standing up and go to the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and the dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is fed by the gener@@ ator of the group and so b@@ wel@@ le and its volunte@@ ers work until the early hours of sunday .
it is a ti@@ ring bet , but village musicians usually help motiv@@ ate the team .
“ they are dr@@ um@@ ming all night so that we can stay awa@@ ke and continue our work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team will return to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help .
a man explained that the free operation of a tr@@ un@@ k he received now allows him to work again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
besides the weekend clin@@ ics and his work as a sur@@ ge@@ on in the hospital , b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ de .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-@@ profit activity , according to b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest come from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who was at dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine for the second year and volunte@@ ered to work in b@@ wel@@ les group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the usa and europe and support b@@ wel@@ le , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
“ we can be there where we help to absor@@ b blood or to use the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le ” , explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
this would never be possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their travel to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and bring their heal@@ th-@@ care material with them .
but once you are in y@@ a@@ oun@@ de , b@@ wel@@ le will take over the accommodation , transport and instruc@@ tion .
“ he is undoubtedly a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he dedic@@ ates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no boundar@@ ies .
for b@@ wel@@ le , almost constant work is not a burden .
helping others to live happ@@ i@@ er lives , ful@@ filling a promise he made to his father , gives him great pleasure .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people lau@@ gh again and to alle@@ vi@@ ate the pain .
visit the website of as@@ co@@ vi@@ me and learn how to help .
excellent fighting mas@@ tered
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is hor@@ st jan@@ son cut to the body .
jan@@ son was a member of the star trek : deep space nine academy .
nobody can help the old man s@@ anti@@ ago in fishing .
the two comple@@ ment each other very well .
it is almost said that the wr@@ ink@@ les in the nec@@ k of the old man , of whom the fisher@@ man &apos;s boy man@@ olo spe@@ aks , can be seen .
when s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life , sitting on the chair , jan@@ son is very close .
in addition , the role of the old fisher@@ man is by and by a character that jan@@ son excell@@ ently man@@ ages .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who does not give up and who ultimately , through his knowledge and his will , win@@ s the battle against the fish .
jan@@ son is widely regarded as the sole actor on stage .
it man@@ ages to focus the audience ’ s attention so that its mono@@ lo@@ gues do not bo@@ red for a moment .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of water are so real that the spec@@ t@@ ators forget that the sea is only sh@@ ining from blue water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann lets the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he puts the active scene into the light : the cab@@ in of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , who is connected with her songs and her splendid voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhy@@ th@@ m and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the city of cologne is situated on a canal of se@@ wage from the roman period .
if you visit cologne , you will not pass the cathedral .
the two to@@ wers rise into the sky around 15@@ 7 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers susp@@ ect that it is also a lot to discover under the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the subject of cologne ’ s un@@ ter@@ wel@@ t .
the service center of cologne tourism is located directly at the dom .
the tour starts un@@ spectac@@ ularly : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city fa@@ thers wanted a city that is accessible by car , and therefore the remains of the old city walls were only standing in the way of what was not too great .
most users of the car park are therefore rus@@ hing past the roman remains and they are only leaving their car .
but if you look more closely , you will find a metal mes@@ h separated from the metal gri@@ d in the park dec@@ k d@@ 2 .
the ru@@ ins of the hand@@ leg@@ er br@@ ic@@ ks are about five metres high .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city walls that came to be e@@ rec@@ ted after christ in the second half of the first century , &quot; schul@@ ze tells .
before it goes back to the day@@ light , schul@@ ze leaves participants in the upper parking level a gl@@ ance at a dark , 15 meters deep sha@@ ft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which , unfortunately , is hardly noticed .
the next stop of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , and here the participants des@@ cen@@ d down to the depth .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the pre@@ cur@@ sor of the c@@ ca@@ a .
what c@@ ca@@ a means , a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city roman law and city of ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ ser , founded under the name of &quot; .
and the pre@@ tori@@ um is the former stat@@ ue palace , the power center of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the vor@@ be@@ re@@ ich of the exhibition , a tunnel access leads to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is preserved here in a length of about 120 metres .
&quot; you can easily follow a piece along the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want &quot; , schul@@ ze encour@@ ages the guests .
schul@@ ze still has a surprise .
after having collected the key at the chec@@ k@@ out , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to get to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which was in@@ dispens@@ able for rit@@ ual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , has seen the var@@ ying levels of water through changing levels of the rh@@ ine .
the mi@@ k@@ we are part of an archae@@ ological area on the town hall square , for which construction work is due to begin shortly .
however , a few years will pass before completion .
le@@ g almost un@@ h@@ acked : re@@ issue of ro@@ ck@@ er process
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ mil@@ i@@ eu will be re@@ ro@@ lled after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted death k@@ ill@@ ings , dangerous body in@@ jury and damage to property against two thir@@ ty years has begun before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safety measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remain silent on the start .
they are said to have been active in the rock scene and have been part of the band@@ di@@ dos at that time .
the prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses you of being in the office of fin@@ ow@@ furt in june 2009 , together with unknown accompl@@ ices , in a car and having taken action on three men .
all the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man almost lost his le@@ g .
the victims are to be part of the compe@@ ting group of hel@@ l ang@@ els .
one is to have been a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
it seems that prece@@ ded this was a ch@@ ase with several cars .
according to the indic@@ tment , they were about re@@ vol@@ ving batt@@ les and a power demonstration .
the two def@@ end@@ ants were acqu@@ it@@ ted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said then that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice suspended the ruling after the re@@ vis@@ ation of the public prosecu@@ tor and referred it back to the court for further negotiation .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in open execution because of another off@@ ence .
the first step was to re@@ construc@@ t the processes of the tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
as a witness , the commissioner who was investig@@ ating at the time was invited .
the focus was on mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had been inter@@ cep@@ ted by the police .
it is difficult that ro@@ ck@@ ers almost always ab@@ ide by a law that they respect - not statements - in court .
that also applies to the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims had been caught .
ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the frankfurt prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office ( oder ) said on request that new don@@ ations have been found since the last trial .
ele@@ ven more negotiating days are set for the process .
the dispos@@ s@@ essed society does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the mo@@ od good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the pe@@ as@@ ants of people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and back seat , hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable .
of course , there may be some cock@@ tail or spar@@ k@@ ling wine to blame for this !
what is more obvious than ch@@ illing to drive to the next dri@@ ve-@@ in to get a little bit of satisfaction ?
i admit i am happy to be with you when it comes to late night or early morning food .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x as if home and in bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
because what should you miss if you keep on regularly re@@ viewing your fa@@ st-@@ food bags from the car window ? !
the most popular street is the &quot; old town &quot; , which is a popular street street street street street street with a lot of shops and restaurants .
&quot; why ? &quot; i wonder .
are people to do@@ of to bring the bags home respec@@ table to the next b@@ in ?
it is not only that the paper producer has sh@@ un@@ ned the landscape .
bags have already covered traffic facilities such as lan@@ ding plan@@ ks and have caused accidents .
about what does said &quot; thro@@ w-@@ away society &quot; not think about , but probably they do not even know what this word actually means .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .
there would be a few bags more or less no@@ where - unlike the road where nobody could find the food resi@@ due of other tr@@ amps .
i can see that the day is already coming when cities and municip@@ alities will be left to sh@@ ut their feet - and the fa@@ st-@@ food cha@@ ins will require a deposit for their bags .
obama ’ s health back@@ sli@@ ding
following intense criticism , president obama with@@ dre@@ w yesterday from his often repeated , clear promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of people have received a letter of cancellation from their insu@@ rer , the republic@@ ans have recently accused the president of having sh@@ ou@@ ted the american public .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ ved his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the many media reports on the redun@@ dan@@ cies , obama called on those americans who received such communications to seek a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forec@@ ast .
“ they come up with a better offer , ” he said .
the government found it un@@ surprising that five percent of the population , who have taken out insurance themselves , had to look for a different tari@@ ff , because their treaty was not in line with the new standards of the aff@@ ord@@ able rec@@ are .
“ i would like to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” se@@ beli@@ us said at a hearing before the representative ’ s house ’ s energy and trade committee in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , responsible for implementing the aff@@ ord@@ able care act , explained that the launch of the online platform since october “ mis@@ er@@ able ” .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as any other , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your trust .
this statement by an an@@ gr@@ y se@@ beli@@ us as a behind her sitting advis@@ or at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives was made following a dispute with the republic@@ an me@@ p , bil@@ ly long , from mis@@ sour@@ i .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly pressed the question why the “ architec@@ t ” of the aff@@ ord@@ able care act should not be volun@@ tar@@ ily limited to a govern@@ ment@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance .
government in jerusal@@ em confirmed attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base
an american official who wanted to remain anonymous sent a letter to the american news station c@@ n@@ n on thursday to the israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es that had been flying a day earlier .
the goal is &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment &quot; , which the israeli government fe@@ ared were responsible for lebanon &apos;s hi@@ z@@ bol@@ lah .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya channel , had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was sh@@ elled on thursday night , wednesday night , and the israel@@ is .
the israeli tv channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , on which russian def@@ ensive missi@@ les of type s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les were built .
un@@ sure the government in jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official in the words that israel believes that it has carried out the attack , but is not safe .
one speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said at least : &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i , the journ@@ alist , stressed in ye@@ di@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ oth that sy@@ ri@@ an regime had been able to prevent the use of bo@@ il@@ -@@ air missi@@ les in the country before , sometimes successfully .
the israeli government has repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to ex@@ pose he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah to chemical or other dangerous weapons would undermine the country ’ s trans@@ gres@@ sion of a red line .
john ker@@ ry , in an unprecedented admission , declared that the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age was “ in@@ appropri@@ ately gone too far . ”
john ker@@ ry imp@@ lied an un@@ expected admission that the def@@ ensive stance of the us in relation to its surveillance programs was not being weak@@ ened by the spir@@ its that were in some cases “ un@@ reasonable . ”
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he , together with bar@@ ack obama , was responsible for “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” , when the explo@@ sive forces were exposed .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information has turned the us government into a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation by its allies .
in a video con@@ vers@@ ation at the open government conference in london , ker@@ ry said , “ there is no question that the president and i , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that have been virtually exp@@ ired by au@@ top@@ il@@ ot .
he was the first high ran@@ king member of the us administration to admit that us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age had cros@@ sed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been ab@@ used .
he said : ‘ in some cases , this has gone too far too far . ’
the president is determined to clarify the situation and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that ab@@ uses are taking place here .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people in this process will not be affected .
ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa be a force of good , and that their monitoring processes saved many lives .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to take their own bre@@ ath . ”
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people , getting them into the air and att@@ acking governments .
so what would be the case if we were able to inter@@ cep@@ t and stop this before it happens ?
we have indeed seen aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we are not aware of such plans before .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the supposed american es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , and to convince europeans of the need to make progress on counter@@ -@@ terrorism efforts with the us , as we have seen in the past .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said he had met representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to compla@@ in about the fru@@ stration of national security surveillance .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans are not too weak in our collective efforts against terrorism . ” said mur@@ ph@@ y , the president of the democratic party for the first time in the sen@@ ate , who is sitting in the chamber .
i also go to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their an@@ ger over the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have further stra@@ ined relations with some us allies , even though the intelligence head this week said that the reports were incorrec@@ t and based on the information he gave .
other rev@@ el@@ ations ci@@ ted the use of the n@@ sa in documents passed on by snow@@ den , according to which the n@@ sa had used the phone of chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the head of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary , and said that this was custom@@ ary on both sides .
in all this tur@@ mo@@ il , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing for the congress ’ s visit , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other members participating will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route will be worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also spoke of some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ ying programmes they have been using for years .
“ although we can change our surveillance programmes , thereby better protecting the rights of europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to sp@@ y , ” mur@@ ph@@ y says .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry is planning a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to meet the res@@ ent@@ ment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an woman is fil@@ ing a case against prison sentence in thailand .
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old woman from sy@@ d@@ ney who was sent@@ enced to 15 days in ph@@ uk@@ et because she had wr@@ ong@@ ly claimed to be rap@@ ed by a taxi driver has voted against the sentence .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was first convic@@ ted by a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on 15 june , to have made a false statement after being handed over to the th@@ ai police .
later , however , the sho@@ ts of a video camera showed that she had safe@@ ly arrived at her hotel after she had been separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they conf@@ essed to have de@@ vised the story .
until the court hearing , she was in police cust@@ o@@ dy on the spot .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to 15 days in prison in a low-@@ security prison at the margin@@ s of ph@@ uk@@ et , rather than in a prison for adults .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former player of the austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ g@@ y-@@ league , who addressed the can@@ ber@@ ra foreign office with the request for help for his daughter .
tun@@ ks declared to the sunday te@@ leg@@ raph in sy@@ d@@ ney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that they will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled against the judgment and is against a ba@@ ht deposit of 50@@ ,000 ba@@ ht at large .
austr@@ ali@@ an reports have said that they have meanwhile been living in the holiday resort of kr@@ ab@@ i in southern thailand .
the court said that b@@ am@@ ford was being replaced by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et and was war@@ ned that the profes@@ sion would also lead to the im@@ position of a higher penalty of up to two years in prison .
however , thailand may also be the first country to become a member of the united states after the recent murder of the p@@ im@@ p , mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith .
