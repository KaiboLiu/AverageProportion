gutach : even more safety for pedestrians
they are not 100 meters from each other : on tuesday , the new b 33 pedestrian amplifier at the village car park was put into operation - within sight of the older town hall lights .
two plants so close together : the intention or the tortoise ?
this question was made clear to gutah &apos;s mayor yesterday .
&quot; the city hall temple was installed at the time because it secures the school way &quot; , eckert explained yesterday .
the kluser-traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the plant officially put into operation yesterday was important for the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossroads .
we have the museum , two churches , kurpark , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic flow from the residential area › grub ‹ .
&quot; the high traffic and pedestrian population had to be accompanied by another traffic light for their safety , &quot; says eckert .
this is confirmed by peter arnold of the federal state council of offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 passes around 12 000 vehicles daily to the municipality of gutah , about 10 percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , &quot; says arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &apos; safety is simply going ahead &apos; , says arnold .
in total , four traffic shows have been carried out , and a roundabout has also been planned , but due to the narrow road in the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossing area .
according to arnold , the choice of location of the light masts was tested beforehand : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long timber trunks we have tested whether these vehicles are being taken out of the engine .
the approximately 15,000 euro expensive traffic lights are the &quot; most modern of them at present &quot; .
the system is equipped with coloured leds that shine so strongly that the lights of the car drivers are illuminated even in low sun .
and it is also thrifty : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .
there are three light systems per direction .
arnold explained the technique of the new facility : this is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pedestrian will be greeted directly by green if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be ended .
&quot; should a group or disabled people go over the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safely on the road , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , drivers must be involved here as partners and observe the road .
this was not the case yesterday : the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green , a cluster vehicle rashed through - at the bright red .
josef winkler has been writing the plight of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .
the disasters of his catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the close and joyless - have left the carinthian poet many things .
the büchner prize winner is known primarily as a prosa-author , theatre texts are in his work rar .
collage from prosatextual gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; meteorological luminaires on the tip of the tongue &quot; , now to be seen in garage x on st. peter &apos;s square .
the theatermacher combines elements from the autobiographical novel &quot; der leigene &quot; ( 1987 ) with prosamieren aus &quot; leichnam , seine familie lauerlich &quot; ( 2003 ) .
on the largely empty stage - important requirements for the performance of a broken stage .
director fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .
the 70-minute performance is overtones the template with a wealth of regime intrusions , known from the repertoire postdramatischer spielshapes .
the actresses in particular come to the attention of the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic reconstructions .
they are hard attacked , excited with their head under water , with their evening robes tapped onto the wall .
the new zellophan , stack , stack in dangerous high poles , and stack them on the staging stage , either they monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor .
the text is conveyed in this rigorous manner .
the best moments are when sung - the band &apos;s range ranges from deep purple to the big folk songs .
only towards the end is the overturned performance a little quiet , and winkler ’ s downright absurd humor bliss up .
a blackbox in the car ?
american road planners are looking for a source of money to compensate for the falling highway system , and believe the solution in a small black box found .
the devices that run every kilometre of traffic and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by washington and the planning offices of the states to stop the obsolete system for financing us american cars .
the usually rather boring area of road planning suddenly has an intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarians have joined forces with environmental groups and are in favour of the government taking small boxes to record the hazardous kilometres – and possibly also the places where they were driven – and of disseminating information to calculate them .
the tea party is appalled .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states no longer wait .
you are currently examining how you can achieve a change over the next ten years to a system in which drivers pay per mile .
thousands of drivers have used the tachograph , some of which are equipped with gps monitoring , and have already tested it .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is not something we will only possibly use , ” hasan ikhrata , ceo of southern california ’ s southern california , said .
the way in which we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway trust fund , which is financed from taxes , is being used to finance the americans at the fuel dispenser , is bankrupt .
but america no longer has as much fuel tank as it used to be .
cars use less petrol .
the state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has been down for 20 years .
politicians dare not to tax even at a cents price , at high prices in terms of fuel .
“ the petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
its state recently bought 500 tachographs , with which a megapix-based pay-system could be tested .
“ this is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it milest-based user clock .
not surprisingly , the idea was popular with urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to change driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and emissions that are harmful to the climate are reduced .
california planners are relying on the system for developing strategies to address the ambitious , legally anchored aims of the state to combat climate change .
but republican bill shuster of pennsylvania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also declared that the united states has not included the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marketers of the reason foundation also have the idea of sending drivers back to the country where they are going .
“ this is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of directives at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , asked congress to move in the direction of mile based billing .
the us senate approved last year a $ 90 million costly pilot project , which includes 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of rural meps who had been representing people who were living in everyday life for many miles on the road to work or to the city .
several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in the direction of their own accord .
the most committed is oregon , which currently has 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon be paying the mileage fee instead of the oil tax to the state .
nevada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering one .
illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .
and the i-95 coalition , which the transport ministries of 17 states have joined on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia and florida ) , is currently investigating the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could track any of its movements .
“ objections to big brother and such things were a big problem , ” says alauddin khan , head of the strategy and result management in the department of transport of nevada .
people did not want it .
when the test was started , the aclu warned nevada on its website : “ it would be relatively easy to find the tachograph in full-grown surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to build a giant , bulky technological infrastructure that could inevitably lead to the creation of new jobs .
nevada is a state in the middle east , which is now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to cross the aerial kilometres , but not when and where .
in order to do so , khan said , the public would also be more reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called true mileage in california .
the company was not originally established to assist states in taxing drivers .
rather , their aim was to create a new market for motor insurance , which would have been a great opportunity for drivers to compete on the basis of the miles they had already earned .
but the devices it tests are also useful for road planners , because they do not work with gps and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .
“ people are more willing to participate when their speed and location are not recorded . ”
some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this .
experimenting with the planner in oregon , they try to find a number of options for the car driver .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or you don &apos;t even select any device and instead pay a flat rate based on the average of all the inhabitants of the state .
others hope to change the concept of a suspicious public by disconnecting devices with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax device that can also be used to pay parking fees , to take insurance only for dangerous kilometres , and to obtain speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which traffic is allowed .
“ the added value of the benefits that the system offers would encourage drivers to participate , ” says in a plan report .
some transport planners , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .
the metropolitan transportation commission for the area of san francisco , spain has declared that officials who are not members of the congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund simply by increasing fuel tax .
an additional one-time fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains randy rentschler , the head of the commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .
if we do , hundreds of millions of motorists are concerned about their privacy and many other things .
königsfeld : small team wacker beats wacker , wacker , the team , but wacker is not sure who will be the best .
the voluntary fire brigade has managed its autumn main test despite a lack of staffing .
only 11 men participated in the exercise .
hans kamerer , commander of the department , had taken the practice to the house of feader in burgberger straße .
a short circuit should be created during sawing .
the resulting fire and the development of smoke injured two people , but one of them could still send a call .
two breathing protection carriers of the armed forces made themselves aware of the situation after the first review by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the first person could be found and lead to the outside .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as a narrow stairway was also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it was a place where there was a lot of wood and also barracks .
there were also electric machines for woodworking .
the first extinguishing attack was carried out by the tank in the vehicle .
another line was built by a hydrant in about 100 meters from the floor .
now three random attacks could be made .
the building also used a hooded tube .
hans kammerer also worked to show that the project was not available .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the day operations group königsfeld .
the commander was dismissed by the exercise .
networking of universities and companies important
during his visit to the district of breisgau / hochschwarzwald , president guido wolf of the country , also explained to titisee neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the foerderzentrum hochschwarzwald , he went to the university of applied sciences and the district gymnasium and the chairman of the advisory board for parental leave to deal with this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , claudia stelle pointed out , director of the hans-thoma school , which is the networked school project education centre in the high black forest .
wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , a successful cooperation exists in the wundererstadt between the foerderzentrum , kreisgymnasium and vocational school center .
he also praised the family-friendly nature of the county .
&quot; it is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to have the phase of care for children and their families because of demographic change , &quot; wolf said .
he also said that more and more people are looking after their relatives and carers .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; said wolf .
but no one could afford to lose skilled labor , he continued .
another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .
&quot; for anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often remains in the hands of the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , &quot; he said .
only if there are enough training places available can the skilled workers need to be met .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-west of germany , close to france and switzerland .
he also experienced a number of problems during his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg , which has already been made for the development of local public transport .
&quot; continue to be persistent and ensure that the public seamless transport becomes better , &quot; he said to the presence of the local politicians present .
with music a fun afternoon through music experience an entertaining afternoon .
for 15 years the kaul family has been inviting the dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and afterwards to a vesper .
in the past , the elderly were induced to rest in the resting place .
meanwhile , this afternoon , the nursing home of st. josef is taking place .
the inhabitants of the home enjoyed the tasty cakes and cakes .
later , there were sausage salads .
with popular melodies silvia kimmic-bantle and her father karl kimmich entertained .
the natural stone wall , which is over 100 years old , is a front line of the old school yard to the church street , which is standing before the renovation , is to be added to the town &apos;s rehabilitation plan .
in the days before the kilbig , the first work of the rehabilitation of the front school yard was carried out with a small corner wall , for stabilisation and static relief of the natural stone wall with balustrade over a hundred years .
the next step , according to alexander misok , is to be taken by the town council of bräunling , to include the landesminale office in the planning and to develop a concept for the old wall .
the aim is to calculate costs by experts who then submit the decision and definition of the further action to the local council .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
after the renovation , pavement and planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the 1912 school , the school must be reconstructed in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure that would require rehabilitation .
the historic , one hundred year old wall of the old school courtyard to the kirchstraße is dominated by water and frost damage , as no drainage is present .
deep cracks in single stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .
a firm wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by students , which is done by the current fixing work .
originally , the school yard was renovated even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure was not a result of a shift .
an important word about the historic renovation of the school walls , which has already been used for film , is the national heritage office .
if you have any suggestions from this site , the city of braunlingen hopes to receive grants from the preservers of the monuments .
the students of the elementary school of braunling. they are now back in a well refurbished old school building with a new aula , and soon can use the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to train jazz in stuttgart .
the ongoing discussions about the future of music schools in baden-württemberg have now also included cem özdemir , the federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to call into question holistic training in the music college stuttgart , &quot; said özdemir &apos;s &quot; stuttgart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are just some of the most important pieces of music at stuttgart ’ s jazz location .
in this way , özdemir , who was chosen in stuttgart as a favourite for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 september , is contradicting the green and red state government .
this forces the development of a new order of the five music schools in basel , württemberg , based on a expert study .
the programme is intended to include the study programme jazz and pop by the musikhochschule stuttgart , the musikhochschule mannheim .
us border : &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling discovered .
on the mexican border with the us , investigators have created a &quot; super tunnel &quot; to drug smuggling and have decommissioned it .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metre tube between tijuana and san diego was equipped with electricity , railroad tracks and an air conditioning system .
three suspects have therefore been arrested , eight tonnes marijuana and almost 150 kg of cocaine have been confiscated .
the tunnel has not yet been used , according to the information .
&quot; these cartels are stupid when they think they could move through under the radar , &quot; said the attorney general of the us district southern california .
i am sure that the duffy , who is being sent to the drug gangs , will tell you that if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we will be making a huge waste of your dirty money .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
constructed by experts
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it is designed by architects and engineers .
the track was equipped to have electrically operated cars .
on the mexican side , access is in a building 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder is 20 meters deep into the tunnel entrance .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters width .
it would have been a good way of encouraging illegal immigration to the us .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was sentenced to death for seized marijuana .
all three face the threat of a life-long deprivation as the highest punishment for their freedom , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , as the press conference in san diego said .
but it is the first time that a tunnel like this has been found to have cocaine .
cocaine is usually produced in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; despair &quot; of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said bill sherman of the drug search destined dea in san diego .
they would do everything they could to get to the us .
no details have been made available on the detainees , at least one being mexicans .
they must be punished for up to ten years .
in 2014 geisinger will be celebrating the year of the year 2014
the anniversary of the town of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the first mention of the town is coming back .
if in just eight weeks the year ends , the anniversary year is approaching .
geisingen and kirchen-hausen were first documented together in 794 .
a document was produced in churches , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march , the jubilee festival will be officially launched , and geisingen is currently not a hall , so this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time , in kirchenen .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are organized in both geisingen and kirchen-hausen .
the church house will be held in july on a festival weekend from july 18th to 20th .
celebrate a return .
on friday , with a celebration , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church hall .
this festival weekend is also the church house of the church .
city music director rudolf barth has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary of the city , which is listed on three dates .
on june 21 , together with the black forest association &apos;s sunday procession , on july 12 in the arena with fireworks and on december 13 as the first concert of city music in the new festhalle .
this will be completed and inaugurated in the year of celebration , the official date is on the last weekend of september , 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the geisinger city jubilee , a new chronicle will be released .
&quot; but there should be a chronicle not only of the mind itself , but also a printed work about the mind of today , which is precisely for reasons of geisingen , church houses , leipferdingen , aulau .
and today &apos;s mind-boggling celebrates 2014 birthday , 1974 the current space was filled with the communitations .
the new chronicle is due to be published on november 21 or 22 in the new festhalle in geisingen .
however , 2014 is also a year with many jubilee .
the fool guild strahglonki starts on february 8 with a night of customs on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony gutmadingen will be 90 years and has on march 29 the festival banquet and .
the altenwerk leipferdingen is 40 years old , the geisinger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipferdingen celebrates it 150 years old and celebrates it .
the town of geisingen was given a gift certificate which was owned by the st. gallen monastery in 764 .
the document was published in churches ( hausen ) , which was then a court .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .
the reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year old accordingly , in addition to this , is the community law of 40 years .
council targets track systems
should the railway crossing be &quot; on the hirsch &quot; elaborately reconstructed in order to increase road safety ?
yes , the local councils have decided .
schiltach has to pay eur 220 000 for this .
the deutsche bahn wants to reach the kinzigtal railway line in the coming year .
safety at railway crossings is particularly important - regularly there are collisions of trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the communities agree to the restructuring measures , they must share with one third the costs , the rest share railways and the federal government .
schiltach &apos;s city builder roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the &quot; bahtransition &quot; on the hirschen .
the city plans to build a new building in the height of the tunnel-mouth to the west of the railway tracks .
there , larger vehicles , such as those transporting long wood , could also be at the back of the road without having to block the tracks .
greeks therefore proposed to build a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could take the road that followed in due course , to build a smoothly flow of traffic .
this was controversial in the municipal council , as some councils stressed the need for road traffic distribution : thomas kipp brought the mood of critics to the point : &apos; do we have to be so much money in so few vehicles &apos; .
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; is used regularly for long-wood transport .
even the &quot; kuhbach &quot; area is transported partly over this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles cross the line at the häberlesbrücke , because they are not going to the main road .
the route also serves as a transfer for those vehicles that cross the tunnel .
it is to be expected that kirchberg and schlossberg tunnels will have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in wolfgang , so the railway crossing &quot; am hirschen &quot; could also be important for a longer .
the councils agreed to examine the costs of the intended broadening of the road .
despite this , the restructuring of the railway transition was approved by a majority , with the proviso that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city can take the road leading to &quot; bahnhofstrasse &quot; , possibly for encounters around 5km .
the reorganization of the railway crossing at the barbery trautwein could , however , lead to a quite different problem , which could make access to the soaring &quot; roltzhäuser weg &quot; .
the administration had to rebuild the railway from the engineering office breinlinger , as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the rolzhäuser would then be possible without further ado .
the study concluded that it was not possible to exclude the possibility that the tilt conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being seated .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road construction company .
the conversion could therefore resolve liabilities .
since both the logging and bending of the current construction state worked , the first step is to follow the rebuilding of the railway transition , which is why haas argued .
at this point , we should also mention the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition route much less than the other railway crossings , because the stop is right next to it , where there is a good visual connection .
even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked to the extent that there is no danger of collision .
most of the buildings were dedicated to the reconstruction of this railway crossing , as the city of schiltach has not solved the problem of sitting cars , according to the councils , since the railway had changed after the construction had finished .
the board considers the reconstructions at the crossings &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; as unproblematic , for which already cross-country agreements have been concluded with the railway .
esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions of euros , and missions for billions of dollars , and missions for billions of dollars .
remote planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the european space agency must now focus on two major projects , which they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
remote worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .
whether or not there are at least some of them .
the choice is difficult : should one look for gravitational waves ?
or rather , explore the origin of the cosmos ?
or to earth like planets , and perhaps alien life to discover ?
these are the questions which the people responsible for the european space agency esa are asking .
for your cosmic vision program , you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make decisive progress in research .
the budget for these &apos; l missions &apos; is about eur 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , the elite of the european space research community met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thirty ideas were on the table , five of which have now come to a close .
many bodies are examining the proposals to remove barriers among researchers .
a final decision by the scientific code of programmes is due to be taken in the next few days .
in total , esa has selected four major questions to which the missions of the cosmic vision programme , which was launched in 2007 , are to be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?
the exact processes involved in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that encirclement these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .
a large infrared telescope in space could break this dark .
and if a star has a planet , what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , the space telescope &quot; chemops &quot; is to be launched in 2017 , with 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , but cheops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could map earth similar planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , thus searching for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , should ultimately be clarified as to what conditions there are for the birth of life .
magnesium is a type of star which is used to treat the sun &apos;s sun &apos;s rays .
in our solar system these processes can be exemplary .
the &quot; solar orbiter &quot; has already been a mission of the m-class ( where the budget is about half a billion euros ) .
the probe is to start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun .
of great interest to the researchers are jupiter and his moons .
they want to find out what role the giant planet plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa sees the first of the three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) starts your journey probably in 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter was assigned to the planet &apos;s atmosphere and the icy monde of europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities to explore matter in extreme conditions and to learn how to make the most of the natural laws we know there .
perhaps there are also variations that could pave the way for physicists to develop a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .
how did the universe come about and what is it made of ?
the company was founded by the urknall 13.7 billion years ago .
in addition to the matter we are familiar with , from the stars , planets and living beings as we exist , there are dark matter whose gravity galaxies and galaxies are clusters .
so far , researchers have not known what physical laws were applied in the first fracture of the big bang , nor what the dark , unclear matter and dark matter were .
with &quot; euclid &quot; , the esa has already approved a m mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
with a special telescope , the probe is intended to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time , thus drawing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
if you could race
of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection process .
the best chances of being awarded as an l mission are , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves .
this includes physicists ’ changes in the structure of space time , which albert einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .
the mission sees one of two or three probes existing detectors , which is deployed in space .
it could be used as a gravitational shaft , unlike plants on earth , which were created at the big bang , and thus generate new knowledge about the emergence of the cosmos .
four other proposals are still competing for the second l mission : a large x-ray set called &quot; athena &quot; , which is black and white .
already outdated are among other proposals for the retractable transport of mars , for the exploration of moon , venus and asteroids , and for solar physics .
snowden ready to compete with germany in terms of us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has declared that he is ready to travel to berlin and to appear before the german bundestag when the american national security agency and its national security agency are closed .
the german member , hans-christian ströbele , met snowden in russia on thursday , where this asylum was obtained to justify the statement in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was published on friday by ströbele to the media in berlin , he writes : “ although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government is still treating a dissent as a dissent .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he is convinced that support from the international community will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the investigation by the us department of justice includes espionage and theft of state property .
german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said to time online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to meet with german representatives , then we will find ways to make this possible . ”
us-germany relations have been damaged by the allegations made by the nsa that they have banned chancellor angela merkel &apos;s mobile phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who has been the head of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret services , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to snowden if possible , ‘ without him ’ .
ströbele , a member of the greens , published an image of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was arrested by two german journalists when he visited russia .
ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of former nsa employee snowden did not return to russia if he wanted to leave the country .
if snowden in germany says , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , he says .
snowden explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him from his home country .
however , it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have been watching the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .
in his letter , snowden makes the german authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”
frontier airlines charges for hand baggage and baggage that is not included in the ticket price .
frontier airlines plans to invest up to 100 u.s. dollars to passengers who are on their flight with their hand baggage .
frontier airlines intends to invest up to usd 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on wednesday stated that it was not necessary to carry passengers the whole se .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
frontier explained that you calculate 25 u.s. dollars if the fee is paid in advance , and 100 u.s. dollars to travellers who arrive at the gate .
frontline speaker kate o &apos;malley said the fee of $ 100 targets to help travelers who are in the run-up to paying .
“ we don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to pay for the first and second checked baggage in 2008 .
passengers who tried to bypass them therefore have as much as possible in their hand baggage .
charges are one way of encouraging passengers to take less with them .
o &apos;malley said at the new charge it is not really about making money .
it is about the most loyal customers of frontier who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger on the platform of frontier may have to carry one piece of baggage for free , but the next person will need to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained that the website of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers can be informed of the charge before they arrive at the gate .
the new baggage handling fee from frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date yet .
passengers often complain about baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines are happy to take them back .
they argue that the transportation of baggage is money and passengers this service should pay if they are willing to .
many on wall street consider the new baggage charges to be a sign that airlines are taking enough money to pay for the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most of them have so far been able to put their fingers on the spot for hand baggage charges .
spirit airlines inc. demanded a new aircraft charter three years ago .
the only airline with such a charge is the hungarian wizz air , explained the airline adviser jay sorensen , who has paid the additional charges attentively .
in a report of december 2011 , he estimated that the hand baggage charge to spirit could bring in usd 50 million a year .
sorensen , who used to be a leader in midwest airlines , has become a member of spirit recently .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth , i could not fail to notice in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected to tear teeth and handy discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was running like lubricated . ”
frontier also follows spirit on the $ 2 that is set for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company explained that passengers who use lemonade or juice would have to keep the whole can and make coffee free of charge .
water is still free .
us airways had recently attempted to provide a refund for soft drinks in 2008 , but made it back seven months later after the airline passengers had complained and had not received any other major company .
frontiers step , fees for hand baggage to collect if passengers are not directly in the airline , is the recent initiative to deal with customers on their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to buy passengers directly from them rather than using an online travel agency .
frontier is , however , the most far-reaching in this area .
in september , the company started to offer only one half as many more frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .
on wednesday , miles were redempted to 25 percent of the route .
a booking made with a third party service provider with frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles .
passengers can also be registered only when they buy directly on the frontier website .
frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .
the proceeds were down by 9 % and flight capacity was down by just 13 % in the first quarter , as the financial report says , which was published on wednesday by the parent company , republica airways .
republics has tried to make the financial aspects of frontier &apos;s business accessible as part of the company &apos;s sales .
proverbs come from the bible
about 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the evangelical church in bisingen .
theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; expressions from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to a lecture after breakfast on the biblical proverbs .
&quot; proverbs contain life-wisdom , regulations or warnings , &quot; she explained .
they compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible points and explained the meaning .
she called proverbs such as : tilt fence is alert , how dandruff falls from the eyes , a eye on someone who gives his is the lord in sleep , his hands washed in innocence .
on several occasions , the speaker advised their listeners to what proverb it was .
the medieval words were taken by the church community councillor christel stretcher .
she explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she used to call &quot; bridges into the past &quot; .
a raffle was raffled .
the prices were covered on a table and humorously rewrote before they were sent to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , mayor roman watson also mixed up .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
at the mecklenburgische seenplatte , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .
under the leadership of the german federal employment agency , 49 men and women who have already been working as unskilled in the industry are to become experts in hotels and restaurants for three winter months .
&quot; what is new is that the six-month courses will end with degrees , &quot; said carmen wiechert from the employment agency neubrandenburg .
the benefits are varied : participants would not be unemployed , firms would be trained , and the workers who would be increasingly employed in hotels and restaurants would be forced to pay for the agency .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce and industry in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( dehoga ) meklenburg-vorpommern .
nsa declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site ’ s crash .
the shadowy national security agency declared on late friday that a bug has caused your public website to paralyse a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was not reachable for a few hours this night , because during a planned update an internal error occurred ” , explains the spy agency in a post e-mail .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( ddos ) was not known .
in the early evening , online server trackers were noticed that the nsa website had been running for at least six hours and this was not available to some users .
previously , a nsa spokesman said to abc news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .
secret information is not at risk , according to the speaker .
at least one group of hack-activists claimed to have been using the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in the event of such attacks , the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .
cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to interfere in the internal network of the target system .
the former supersecret nsa , whose nickname once was no such agency , was the first to be found in the bright light of the public and is looking for the new rules that have been made known in recent months .
the growing controversy surrounding the secret service fuelled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper-operation .
the number of people without jobs has fallen by 22 % to 1,307 in october .
although the 3.1 % quota was better than last year , it was better than in september , &quot; but we would have hoped more , &quot; monika felder bauer says , deputy head of business at the agency .
many companies have reacted to recruitment .
one reason is , according to felder bauer , &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
the new version of the new version of the website is available in german only .
in the middle of december the winter season begins .

loss of profit in bombardier after falling delivery figures and orders for the company .
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc reported a 15-percent increase in sales on thursday .
bombardier , based in montreal , did not publish flight test data for his brand new cseries aircraft , and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft is being operated according to the ambitious schedule in september next year .
the aircraft will be delivered to the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , and this makes it doubtful whether the test phase will be carried out as planned .
the results were below the forecasts and led to a fall in the price of more than eight percent of the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , lowered his rating on thursday of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the fact that the share will be one to two quarters one in the next .
“ weaker delivery figures for aircraft have been expected to the greatest extent possible , but the margin in transport has clearly been disappointed by the development of the transport sector , ” said doerksen in a letter to the customer .
we believe that bombardier should place new orders for the cseries if the test program for the aircraft is progressing .
but if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the program .
bombardier hopes that the cseries will be able to integrate the company into the lower market segment .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and , after months of delay , flew for the first time in september .
but , so far , binding orders for the cseries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet are accurate .
there are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pierre beaudoin is confident that bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
on thursday , the management assured analysts and media that the program was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft has no longer been on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference , adding that during the service life of the aircraft ground tests and software updates were scheduled .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we decided to take a first flight and then to open a period of review , which we have done .
this is happening throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was said from the company side .
yet analysts remain sceptical about whether 12 months after the maiden flight the first customer could take a cseries aircraft into service .
bombardier explained that it is checking the start-up planning and will be able to use it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – even though it appears to be bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning should be extended to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerkke .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bombardiers ’ net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share , from $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share a year earlier .
the adjusted earnings per share is unchanged 9 cents .
sales slightly increased and decreased from 4.2 to 4.4 % .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it had lost 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 in the last year .
net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aerospace division was € 32.9 billion on september 30 , making it a relatively stable € 32.9 billion compared to december 31 .
“ in the aerospace sector , the results were within the framework of our specifications , but the low intake of orders and market relations as a whole were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace division fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment increased by almost 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport segment was 32.6 billion dollars on september 30 , and was thus slightly higher than 31 december .
the transport profit margin was determined by handling problems in some major contracts .
according to the management of the company , new targets will be set for the fourth quarter .
in the afternoons trading on thursday , the bombardier share declined by 8.5 percent and stood at 4.83 canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the google financial board patrick pichette was in .
the brazilian embraer sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardiers of the engster rival , reported a 10 % decline in the quarterly profit on thursday .

cocaine addicted lawyer , the drug boss warned against police investigation , must be put in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid to stop his secret drug addiction .
he was awarded the crown court of liverpool for three years .
a well-known criminal defender who has a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid to kill his secret drug addiction could be discovered , was sentenced to three years in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied underground size neil scarborough with sensitive information about investigation into the country &apos;s activities in the drugs trade after being replaced by his own cocaine addiction .
the “ first-class ” prized by criminalists is a lawyer with the nickname “ bash ” in his house in 2011 , after the police scarborough and his police had been monitored .
officials watched scarborough ( 32 ) have three bags cokain on the house of lawyer in blakburn , lancahire , and abbey .
the investigation revealed that ditta regularly uses drugs of class a , but after the tests spread traces of cocaine in his hair , on his letter , and on his body and on credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried illegally to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were then prosecuted by the police in a major investigation to the heroin and cocaine trade in lancashire , cumbria , merseyside , berkshire and west .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had been subjected to a series of house searches , heroin and cocaine worth £ 1.5 million , as well as £ 200,000 in cash .
ditta , 42 , passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be published .
today , ditta , who was responsible for forbes soliciters in blackburn , was arrested at liverpool crown court after a three-week trial in two attendance points .
he said in an earlier survey that he was in possession of cocaine .
the lawyer was transferred after the police had been able to take action against scarborough in their investigations that he was in regular contact with the police in february 2011 .
two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw how he could be sentenced to ditta &apos;s house , where drugs were confiscated with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .
shortly after he delivered drugs , scarborough telephoned with ditta , who was at dinner at the football stadium of blackburn rovers in edouard park .
the lawyer returned home , took over drugs and then the police were sent nine communications between the two .
it was announced in court that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing drugs of class a in his hair , his letter and the letter bag were tested .
ditta was later arrested , but dismissed to take cocaine and said he had to go to the alleged dealer because he had lost his client .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to buy a number of credit cards , but they were secured and he was offered a sample of hair .
in police interrogation , he said that he is operating both under his private address and at work , and clients would be able to prosecute him at home for legal matters .
he was announced in court that he had been a major player in the drugs trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a prosecutor should be better than anyone to know that you can ’ t break the law . ”
ditta will not be able to escape the abuse of his position as a criminal defender , since he has interfered too much with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who has been providing drugs to his lawyer .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the advocate of these people .
but that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he has been involved in the police investigation as far as possible , so that they can continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr ditta thus discredited his profession .
he was too close to certain clients , particularly scarborough , and he allowed the company to compromise his independence .
ditta pointed out any misconduct and claimed , “ if i am a corrupt lawyer , which i am not , and information to scarborough is passed on , then i would not give 15 hours to wait , but to do so .
but after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said by the police in lancashire : “ mr ditta has moved from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he arrives .
his cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who appointed him to provide valuable information about police investigations .
lawyers must be able to maintain the highest standards of integrity and to ensure public confidence and confidence .
ditta has evaded this trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organized crime unit from lancashire was the head of the investigation of ditta , who also led to a sentence in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the hindering of justice .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being subjected to the conspiracy to the heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .
thirty-five other drugs players are listed on the list of total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .
ditta published a section of questions and answers about itself on its website , where he indicated that he was doing his dream job as a lawyer and a client in the death row in america .
the revolutionary work of church music
at the end of the celebration of its 160-year anniversary , the song crane dunningen will host two services with the &quot; deutsche messe &quot; by franz schubert .
after the great success of the music &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attracted the audience this spring .
on saturday , 26 october , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 at the evening fair in st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday , 27 october , from 10 : 15 a.m. at the religious service in the church .
the so-called deutsche messe ( german trade fair ) , with the original title &quot; singing to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the fair &quot; , d 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer franz schubert galery from 1826 .
the fair will be listed in the services of god , as the client johann philipp neumann had in mind .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir is led by the brass group of the musikverein glühsinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
hash : skepticism is increasingly indulging in confidence .
the parish council elections in 2015 , for example , will bring about a change in the hassach ( se ) soul unit .
there is only one parish council for all six parish councils .
in a joint meeting , the committees of haslach , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach prepared for the changes .
the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and the pfarrhodes are to be used as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that scepticism about the new is tending to be increasingly confident .
the ideas and expectations for the innovations 2015 and the concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council have not been met by the very constructive discussions held by the six bodies with the main representatives of the ministry of culture .
regional dean georg schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the newly defined guidelines for seafaring units in the archdiocese of freiburg .
after that , the church of san haslach will become a body of public law which will be incorporated into the rights and obligations of the six church communities .
there will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council , in which the parish council of the amté is represented .
from each parish at least two elected members are to be represented , in the six parish churches so-called parish teams are formed .
your task will be to make the church life in the place a reality .
on the question of the finances of the parish , a great need for dialogue emerged .
the innovations provide that collected funds will be used in the parish buildings for specific purposes .
liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire community .
it is precisely in view of the large planned investments , the commitment of which will affect all the parish population , that there have been major concerns .
&quot; in the past , investment was only made in projects that were developed by the individual parish owners alone , &quot; relativized haslach &apos;s parish community charter .
practical experience with a joint committee for five parish churches was described by barbar knights , the chairman of the board of the soulbound schutterwald-neuried .
they had set themselves the task of becoming one , staying five in 2006 , and found that it is not so easy .
the hassan soulship unit bodies then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the work will be further developed in further meetings and will be discussed in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the parish council michael schöner from steinach presented the new logo of the soulbound unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , electricity is more expensive than in the past .
the citizens of pfullendorf must be prepared for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the stadtwerke , jörg-arne bias , confirmed to the south courier , a four-headed pfullendorfer family will receive between 70 and 90 euros extra costs per year .
the main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called ec levy of 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .
this levy is paid every october by the four operators of the major power routes .
these figures show the cost of the additional costs incurred by the energy turnaround , which you can impose through a levy over the price of electricity .
the town ’ s pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company even drew attention in its forecasts to a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias reported .
now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the city plants would inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bias , with the number more near the 2 cent .
traffic lights on permanent red : keep a close eye on the waiting time .
sometimes a traffic light simply does not green .
the contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .
what should we do then - drive red ?
has a person been involved for long enough in a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the stuttgart airport declares the attorney ralf becker in the magazine &quot; motorrad &quot; .
the waiting time must be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which is different from case to case .
becker advises you to hold out at least five minutes before you are talking about a traffic light to work .
if you want to continue driving despite the red light , you must be aware that it is not suitable for a accident caused by it .
if you have been listening for less than five minutes , you may not be long enough to warn becker and point to a decision by the supreme court of hamm .
in the case under negotiation , a driver had a chance to drive around three minutes of continuous red light and had to be prepared for a negligent red light offence .
the traffic lights were not broken , but they jumped on green a little later .
he was not allowed to travel because of the special situation , but he was not penalized .
the municipal council welcomes solid budget and the new budget .
whenever there is a community budget in local councils , mayor ralph gerster has a good laugh .
the municipal backpack in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a complete success in this respect .
this was confirmed at the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .
as andrea rothmund said , the administrative budget is about eur 7.6 million over a million more than the planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget also stands at around eur 1.8 million over the approach , which is about eur 1 million .
the surplus is due above all to higher commercial tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the wealth budget was again well above the planned values .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
as less investment is planned in the 2012 financial year , there is also a need for the return allocation to be higher .
overall , the overall reserve was reduced by around eur 2.1 million to eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanked rothmund and her team for their good work .
&quot; such a work cannot be shaken off the sleeve , &quot; gerster praised the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were visibly happy with the good figures .
it may sound paradoxical , but it is these very good figures that citizens could soon find expensive .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to rely on high leverage in the past .
this in turn , however , has already been said to have been cut back on more than one occasion on subsidies from the country .
for these subsidies from various compensatory poles , there are conditions .
among other things , the towns and communities requesting subsidies must be given certain leverage .
&quot; we have to look at the subject of hoists , because in the coming years investments will be needed for which we would like to receive grants , &quot; said gerster .

kenyan press outraged the controversial media law
“ we are in a frightening position and we should ask ourselves : what does parliament think about simply taking the judge ’ s independence out of tomorrow ? ” , said the newspaper ?
“ the law is draconian and very punishable , and we reject it , ” said cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , to which capitalfm is also a respected independent radio station .
he said that the new media tribunal is “ always prejudice , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would make kenya ’ s position in the global economy damaged .
“ i hope the president listens to us and we call on him to reject this bill and to return to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government is taking effective action against the media through the new law , whereas the standard , democracy and freedom of speech in kenya , has been “ a heavy blow , ” and betitelle has claimed .
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at improving national security following the attacks by armed islamists .
the kenyan media withdrew the public authorities ’ anger for publishing security cameras , on which they could see how the people working on the scene of the crime were supposedly the luxury shopping mall .
police chief david kimaiyo responded by placing an order for two journalists and one of the leading media representatives , even though the subpoenas were still in the process of being withdrawn after a media outcry .
under the new law , media houses can be granted a penalty of up to 20 million kenyan schillings and individual journalists can be punished with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accredits .
the tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ even one sentence can kill most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”
moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the “ lively blogosphere ” that it describes as kenya .
if you are silencing the media , politicians could go unpunished , whatever they want .
“ no one will ever know it , ” mutuma mathiu , journalist at the nation , who denounced kenyan media as a decisive factor in public life .
“ leave politicians to their own devices , lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the age of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators have been in the past causing public anger .
in may , they agreed to refund the compensation commission appointed by the national compensation commission .
bad-dürrheim : a dream comes true for the fc dürrheim
the city and the football club lost their official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf sports field despite the cold weather .
a more pleasant celebration was probably celebrated last saturday , but petrus wanted to avoid playing with him .
so all those who had to leave without umbrella or have had to leave such a place for any reason .
this was done by musicians who were framing the festival , just as many speakers did .
wet was therefore also the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .
his thanks were due to mayor walter klumpp , who was responsible for the implementation of the project , the municipal council , the companies involved and members of the association who took part .
here , especially lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .
retired people moved 400 square metres of pavement for the new paths .
this remarkable voluntary commitment also appreciated the country &apos;s mep , karl rombach .
further greeting was given to the urban sports committee hubert baier , the district chairman of the south baden football association , kuno kayan , and friedrich knorr of the planning office , the european commission .
mayor klumpp reminded us that recurring weather influences in the spring and autumn are attributable to the original lawn place in such a way that it could not be played .
the first thoughts on the solution of the problem were already 15 years ago , when the construction of a third place was planned for the football club or the real school at the salinensee lake .
both have been discarded .
six years ago , ideas were put forward for the creation of an artificial turf sport area , which is generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were adopted two years ago , when the fc moved the schabelstube to hergleichte , a cost of eur 100 000 to build the place and promoted the country to eur 104 000 .
the municipal council decided in october 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros , klumpp summarized .
the construction of the 68 x 108 meter artificial turf site was completed on june 4 .
during the three-month construction phase , 3000 cubic metres of soil were worn out , half of which were used for the creation of a dirt bike route .
the union and the spd have concluded their coalition negotiations with the issues of internal and judicial affairs .
the relevant working group was also meeting in berlin in the morning .
one of the issues is direct democracy , members ’ bribery and the federal police .
the morning also wanted to see the migration and integration working group continue its deliberations .
this is probably one of the issues that should be addressed here , namely dual citizenship , where both sides have conflicting ideas .
the spd wants to impose the pressure on german-born immigrant children to choose one , but the union is not in favour of a double passport .
on the subject of transport , which was not on the agenda this friday , the spd underscored its ‘ no ’ vote to a pkw toll requested by the csu .
a vignette is a &quot; flatrate for the multitude , thus counterproductive in ecological terms &quot; , declared by the spd negotiator on transport , florian pronold , in a letter to his group .
there were imminent fall-off on land roads that are already the main areas of accident .
the introduction of a toll for all cars would also be , from pronolds ’ point of view , only a first step .
&quot; there is a danger that the compensations for german people will be cancelled at a later date , &quot; he said .

vienna airport creates passenger calls from vienna airport
mr max maier , please come to gate 24 .
announcements of this kind will be no longer held at vienna schwechat airport .
most of the loudspeakers are lost - the noise level is to be reduced so much .
creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .
as airport spokesman peter kleemann announced to radio vienna , vienna airport follows with the suspension of announcements affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai already do not make the noise calls .
the disappearance of these averages - on average around 200 personal incidents from the loudspeakers in one day - should make it more peaceful in the future to approach the airport .
&quot; it has also been shown in experience that these individual failures have been perceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information on changed flight schedules or departure times here a little go away &quot; , says kleemann in talks .

the other is the vegetarian heritage of the world vegan day on november 1 .

toppable plant cream replace conventional beverage .
there are also vegetable alternatives to eggs .

sleepless in new york
on the way to their host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the students of the black forest gymnasium learned the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , the brooklyn bridge was just off the road , where the heart of the city , manhattan , was reached on foot .
this is a fascinating view of the world famous skyline , which is being played in the evening light .
the time shift meant that students had to walk on their legs for almost 24 hours , but true to the motto &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; , the day was decided on at times square .
despite shutdown , the freedom statue could be filled with a ferry on the second day and it could be reached on foot .
then there was the financial centre around wall street , which was the memorial of september 11 .
on the third day , the students were able to enjoy the 373 meter high viewing platform of the empire-state building , an overview of the fascinating city , while taking in the view .
after that , the hectic pace of new york streets swept over rockefeller center to central park , which was an ideal opportunity to stay for a short while in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , students are now arriving in their host families and experience a variety of exciting experiences at the weymouth high school .
this year , the saint hubertus day will be celebrated in the parish church of st. marien at the hulsbergstraße in the city of hulsbergstraße .
st. hubertus was , as it were , a rather ruthless hunter , who was converted by a vision and later became bishop of liège .
the hunting horn brass group of the hunting tribes westphalia , led by brigitte kluth , music. it is based on parforcehorns ( natural horns in the mood es ) .
the brass wears horse clothing because they are mainly horse-riding , horses and dog owners on trawling .
the festive fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed optic gloss with a new cafe .
one that is used to stay and come back .
one that wants to make the name of the program .
the name déjà vu is a psychological phenomenon , according to the lexicon , which is expressed in the sense that a new situation has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the opschlag in the district town of kleve , within sight of the rhein-waal university , it is not necessary to remain with the pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim : to make a real stay not only in thought , but also in a handful of times to be experienced recurring .
because it &apos;s fun and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look at the interior of the opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight .
the ultra-modern , but not cool cafe-ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the team spoils its founders mirjam van der stett and daniel büttner at the top with a wide range of coffee and cocktail variants .
there are also delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already registered themselves before the opening of the ornamental cafés at the opschlag as gastronomic companies. in kranenburg they conducted the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kleve , the german association of the german and european artists hopes to get more audience .
the university of applied sciences , too , has done so .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group &quot; , says daniel büttner .
rather , the two students here want to address themselves to the elderly as well as to all ages .
speaking of cafe lovers .
the friendly owner is behind the coffee shop .
enjoy the smelling hot bräu in a variety of different variations .
expressfan
daniel büttner is more of an expresso fan and mirjam van der stedt the cappuccino trinker .
&quot; a baguette - that &apos;s my thing &quot; , she tells the nrz .
two events were also held in the bright café .
better put , one .
the port festival was held outside rather than outside - the café déjà vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the ringelnatzevening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a very special fan of event evenings , either : &quot; you can &apos;t do it to all &quot; .
and with an event i always speak only those who are interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception rather than the rule .
&quot; we want to keep the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
should i say : déjà vu also stands for reliability .
as regards the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the opschlave .
the road that is increasingly becoming a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klevers who welcome guests from close and far and the students who want to visit the gastromile and therefore also the café déjà vu .

a day of thanks to the mgv in dinker
it was the 165th anniversary of the foundation of the &quot; friedrich wilhelm dinker &quot; mgv this year and was attended by 52 guests , active singers and their wives .
the club restaurant &quot; witteborg &quot; in dinker genocide has all enjoyed the harmonious coexistence of the music .
traditionally , the foundation festival is also the right festivity to honour .
the special award &quot; singer of the year &quot; was a pleasure for the writer rolf wagener .
&quot; you have written a lot for us , but you have also had some laps for us , and we would like to thank you for that , &quot; says the chairman of the choir erich schlotmann .
the awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity shrubs went to the choral director dieter schulze with 44 participants , followed by the honorary chairman horst pier-pier-pier-roger .
the number five was awarded by the notaries artur brückner .
a special thank you was sent to the team of vereinswirtin ange pier-ribbert , who once again created a menu of the extra class and was awarded to gerda pier-ribbert for the table decoration .
the mgv &quot; friedrich-wilhelm &quot; meets for its regular choir rehearsals every tuesday at 7.45 p.m. at the club .
&quot; new sound-pleasing voices are always welcome &quot; , says schlotmann .
un announces new targets for poverty reduction .
the united nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to achieve the millennium development goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which is to start in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in the drive for “ sustainable development ” that would replace the millennium development goals expiring in 2015 .
they were included in the final draft document , which was drafted by world leaders , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that member states have agreed to create a process that will enable the eu to develop universal , sustainable development goals .
“ these goals are based on our progress in the millennium development goals and will provide an integral part of the framework for development after 2015 .
i will spare no effort to remedy this problem that has been given to me by the member states in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
although sg achim / baden has been without victory for four days , the handball oberligist still enjoys a good mood .
this is what trainer tomasz malmon has no doubts about .
all of them are still fully motivated .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally win again .
&quot; because i don &apos;t know how to win this way &quot; , i guess malmon expects a success experience of his team .
even if the third league reserve is made up of fredenbeck , no trees are currently being cut out , malmon raises warnings in advance of the search .
many players have i still train in a youth .
they will therefore be voting against their ex-coach in particular .
&quot; it is also important to see whether there will be any further reinforcement from the first one , &quot; explains the sg-coach .
to finally return to the success story , the malmon-team must be more competitive than the previous performances on the market .
in particular , the provision of cover and the switching game has made a huge difference .
it is also essential to improve the exploitation of opportunities .
therefore , i hope that my players will finally be able to get their heads free during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and leaders .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora mnel , the founder of the state and first president of mozambique to attend a rare public demonstration calling for peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fear for the country ’ s future has made it a fashion garment for a t-shirt with the label “ we demand security ” in portuguese and signed up to the crowd on thursday of the capital ’ s independence square .
for two weeks , there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially led by the white rhodesia and later by apartheid government in south africa .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a full-scale conflict , but the recent events have left foreign investors and domestic concerns .
there is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the north-west could generate investment of more than $ 50 billion in the coming years from companies like rio tinto .
the ruling frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and renamo give each other the blame for tensions .
renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by holding its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated as renamo government troops were attacking and destroying the country &apos;s military base .
the government blames renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has sought to reduce concerns about instability .
in comparison to afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dhlakama was “ loser . ”
both frelimo and renamo stress that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since mazanga , quoted in the words of renamo , renamo , adhere to the 1992 peace agreement .
in relation to the ft , he said that frelimo did not respect the agreement any more .
“ our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” mazanga said .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) here who bring the heads together , ” says joseph haydn .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions .
renamo , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already declared that it will boycott the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some commentators have described the use of force as an attempt by a wretched movement to make concessions and financial benefits from the government .
renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former renamo member , has been supporting movimento democrático de moçambique ( mdm ) .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – will destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says mazanga .
it is unclear what capacity renamo has , but it has caused disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .
most of the fighting took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , but in which is located beira , the port , the mining companies such as rio tinto and rio exalto .
in june , rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after renamo launched an attack on the track .
mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether renamo would repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things in mozambique are not going well , ” said mazanga .
instability has stirred frustration over the government , fernando lima says , leader of mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people were already worried about corruption , bad news .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the person who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in renamo and filimo , they simply want peace and usable roads again , ” he said .
children should read myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says a writer .
thor &apos;s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance of defeating clever tricks , ” and artus legend demonstrates that it is important to keep a dream .
many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .
i have been proposing this for twenty years as a plan .
he added that , for authors and teachers who have “ overly didactic ” , children would be “ completely shut down ” , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subliminal ” .
crossley-holland , the beowulf from the anglo-saxon region , and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british folk tales , declared : “ you can follow certain intentions : ”
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author who is for children is that of a person who has a desire to convey hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is a real sense of good and evil .
this must be subliminal , revealed by history and not explained .
this is the old story of showing rather than telling .
hansjakob moves again to freihof
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob retained his retirement home in haslach , and on sunday his last years were alive in the &quot; freihof &quot; .

his criticism of the church of the state had been expressed by hansjakob at the time , just as his concerns about the agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home area , behind its tomb chapel on the fire near hofstetten , he found his resting place .
&quot; a troubled spirit had finally found its calm and had gone home forever , &quot; said it at the end of the scene .

ben greenman : ten years new york comedy festival : the new york comedy festival : the new york times .
one could say that new york city is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in america : just under a hundred years ago , the variant artist frank fay began to create a musical composition as conférencier in the united states .
over the years , fay ’ s innovation has been enhanced , as was the last time at the new york comedy festival .
founded and managed by caroline hirsch , founder of the stand-up institution caroline , the company celebrates the festival this year its ten-year anniversary .

we have designed this festival to continue working with you .
at this year &apos;s event , wanda sykes , kathy griffin and bill maher are performing as well as booth up for heroes , an annual music and comedy festival .
the festival also makes the world of comedy grow .

nick kroll was played with a sitcom on cable television ( the ironic slippery fantasy football series &quot; the league &quot; on fxx ) and has now released his own sketch show .
jenny slate was both at “ saturday night live ” and at “ parks and recreation ” part of the occupation , although she was best known for her viral video series “ marcel the shell with shoes ” .
both kroll and slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices ( the surreal pessimistic anthony jeselnik , the ironic , on racial issues concentrated w .

from 2005 to 2007 he presented a television programme entitled sit down .
the meeting takes place in town hall in the middle of manhattan .
&quot; the city is definitely in the comedy dna of larry &apos;s entire work , &quot; said steinberg .
he told me when he is here , then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks : hey , when i put all my money to lose , then i may live here .

drama in uruguay : young people kill gambling rabbits with machete , and machete .
two children have the murder of 11-year-old in uruguay .
the two 14 and 12 year-old boys had invited their victims to join them in bird hunting .
with machinets and knives armed , they staged the 11-year-old on tuesday and threw the corpse into a well , reported the newspaper &quot; el pís &quot; on thursday .
they would then have been walking in front of their homes in a working-class quarter .
the corpse was found in the village of cerro pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive village of cordoba punta del este .
as an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the younger one who took them with her should say that she was sexually assaulted by the young .
when the girl was murdered in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her , the two boys gave the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .
the reason given by the elder was , among other things , a rivalry in the football game .
he was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institute .
pimps must be put in prison
because of the exploitative trafficking in human beings , pimps , threats , insults and dangerous physical injury , konstanz district court has appointed a 33-year-old man from st. georgen to three and a half years in prison .
the former german soldier who was killed after two operations in afghanistan as a turkish officer , put a case to the police in a process agreement .
so in five cases , he has informed women about internet or telephone contacts , which he has after a few weeks to go against her .
he used to resist by force and threats .
the income of women , who have been earning for them for some years , was retained .
by confiscating mobile phones and sim cards , it subordinates women ’ s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who communicated the women , he brought them to different brothels in the southwest .
he also had a number of checks carried out to control their revenue .
the accused first claimed that he was suffering under a severe trauma after colleagues in afghanistan joined him in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert had serious doubts about mental limitations and thus about a limited school leaving the school to be held accountable , the 33-year-old put forward a comprehensive confession .
the court did not have to hear any of the women who were injured .
as a kripo official reported , after a first call by telephone surveillance measures , at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking could be identified .
the interceptions that were intercepted were highly aggressive .
in later interrogation , the victims would have confirmed their martyrdom .
another witness , one of the women watching blue fleece across the body , has still not heard of it .
it is &apos; a completely broken personality &apos; , which is used to condemn violence and exploitation in this metier as normal .
the accused yesterday regretted his behaviour .
&quot; he dissolved from these circles and wanted to go to prison for a normal life , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to rise to usd 96 per barrel .
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , as concerns over a high supply overshadowed a report that argued that china ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .
the reference crude oil variety for deliveries in december was sold in europe late in the morning in electronic commerce at the new york mercantile exchange by 14 cents to 96.24 usd per barrel .
the contract fell by 39 cents on thursday , which resulted in a 5.8 percent drop in prices in october .
the large supply of crude oil has affected prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy declared on wednesday that the us offer was down by 4.1 million barrels last week .
in the course of five weeks , the offer has increased by 25 million barrels .
but on friday there were indications of stronger demand by two reports of an increase in chinese manufacturing activity .
this indicates a continued economic recovery in china , whose growth is set at 7.8 % in the third quarter .
crude oil from the brent variety , a reference value for international crude oil , which is also used by us refineries , is now in the ice export market .
court blocks decision on the stop and frisk directive of the nypd .
a federal appeal court in the us blocked the order of a judge on thursday , who had made changes to the stop and frisk program ( “ stop and browse ” ) of new york police station .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that judge shira &apos;s decisions would be suspended until more than a recital of the city was decided .
the judge had judged in august that the city had violated the constitution with the way in which the programme for the raising of and occupation was conducted .
the city appealed against its assessment and its ordered remedies , including the decision to establish a surveillance body to monitor the situation of the police in the amendment of its directive and the relevant training programme .
the appeal court heard the arguments on tuesday about the requested suspension .
the appeal report stated that the judge had to be exempt from the case , because she had not yet complied with the code of conduct for us judges , specifying that a judge would have to avoid the appearance of partisanship ;
the judge had judged that police officers had injured the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeted in black and latin american men with the stop ban .
she appointed an external monitoring unit to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with an on-board team of cameras in quarters .
in august , the city of new york agreed to continue the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who are looking for police control to be released .
an oral negotiation on the vocation of the city is planned after march 14 , 2014 .
the stop and frisk tactics have been developed by a number of civil rights defenders .
controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of office of the partisan mayor michael bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , the number of latin men .
in 2004 , four men who were all minorities brought a complaint , which resulted in a collective action .
advocates of changes to the stop and frisk program of the nypd say that the changes will end unfair practices and will create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as the way in which the bureau influences are handled .
opponents believe that the changes would deter the morality of the police , not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that has been forced to close after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she had not yet received the stop and frisk practice .
the luck of the dreaming camels
luck is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels succeed .
this bedouin wisdom was used to describe the first chairman wolfgang henne as a reference to the history and fascination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated , which was already a significant success .
the first chairman , mr henne , gave a detailed report on the work of the association .
he was the first time in 2004 in mauritania in the cheijk-zajed hospital in nouakchott .
as a result , further cooperation developed , and the gynaecologist henne led numerous operations on several trips on the spot .
during the speeches , pictures of the missions were shown on a big screen , so that guests of the anniversary event of the above actions could get an idea of the actions .
the club &apos;s desert vehicle has also been shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
rainer prewo , the former ob von nagold , had proposed to replace this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to build a new car at the club , according to henne .
in 2008 , the zimmerei schleeh from baiersbronn won the hospital in baiersbronn , a misery quarter on the edge of the capital - an honorary office .
henne also mentioned a new mother ’ s child hospital in nouakchott .
especially interesting in times when nagold was the birth clinic wegrationalized .
you learn a lot in africa as a medical practitioner , henne says , for example , discouraging burn-out .
the political unrest in the country has not allowed as many trips as planned , but many medical professionals have come to germany to work here in various areas .
in addition , containers are regularly sent to africa , so in march of this year medical devices , drugs , association materials , hospital beds and glasses .
mitiator hans joachim fuchtel himself supplied plenty of local colorit by presenting a new version of the album from mauritania to the mobile goat stable .
when his personal motives were mentioned , he called his work in the area of auditing as a young member of parliament .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to give the africans a hand in controlling a budget by the people .
fuchtel also stressed that global economics also requires global love of human beings .
nor should we forget that africa is closer than some think .
from gran canaria , it is not far from africa .
coulson set up telephone hacking to check a tip .
the former news of the word editor andy coulson supposedly put “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” into trying to find a wrong tip about an affair of the then interior minister charles de gaulson .
prosecutor andrew edis qc declared that the court in the old bailey had published news of the world in may 2005 a false rumour that clarke was a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” .
the newspaper commissioned the private detective glenn mulcaire to investigate pawlby &apos;s voicemails , and pursued them to protect them , but coulson also called them and left them behind .
“ in the opinion of the public prosecutor , coulson , who is now the editor of the emergency , is no one who stands in front of people ’ s homes and hopes to tap them in fresh action , but one who is people .
he said that emergency use three procedures to make stories investigative research : telephone search , search , and search .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously , he knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone hacking ?
he denies that , but we say : “ and whether he knew about it . ”
rumors of a clarkes affair were first heard by the feature editorial of notwa , as a source of sexual abuse of pawlby .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was recorded in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the detective &apos;s computer , on which pawlby and her sister were called &quot; projects &quot; .
in the time when the research was running , the grandparents of pawlby received anonymous calls to help them find their way around them .
meanwhile , former chief executive officer nevial thurlbeck and the former chief executive officer , jams weattherup , oversaw the surveillance of the movements of pawlby .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to release tomorrow , about which i would like to talk to charles . ”
edis explained that coulson &apos;s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former home secretary david blunkett .
the jurors heard on thursday that coulson blunkett was arrested for an affair with a married woman , as he himself was being brought to trial by the accused rebekah brooks .
coulson and brooks argue that they should be confused with others , between 3 october 2000 and 9 august 2006 , to hack phones .
mulcaire , thurlbeck and weatherup have the telephone hacking admitted .
in protest against the planned wealth tax , the french football will indeed be the first strike since 1972 .
a conciliation meeting is to be concluded without results .
in the conflict over the wealth tax , the government and professional football in france have moved to the brink of a failed arbitration meeting .
president françois hollande received a letter from the european parliament on thursday in the paris élysée palace , and also from representatives of the association .
he refused to take the soccer from the planned 75 % match .
the other side , too , remained tough .
the dispute announced for the end of november will now be dealt with , the chief of the association of professional clubs ( ucpf ) , jean-pierre louvel , informed .
the conference was held between 29 november and 2 december in the league 1 and league 2 , thus eliminating the possibility of a new round of league 2 .
gechingen : no absolute protection possible !
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in planning at an early stage &quot; , mayor jens hääßler opened the citizens &apos; information event on flood protection in gechingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , answer questions , raise concerns , and exchange ideas .
häussler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council &quot; .
the floods that hit on may 15 , 2009 , unprepared , were a drastic event .
a river basin investigation was conducted with the neighbouring town of aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in chingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal &quot; , says häßler .
the basic idea is to plan the protection against a weather forecast statistically every 100 years .
climate change is being addressed by a 15 % supplement .
this is done in the specialist circles with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that were brought to bear in chichingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year flood .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve &quot; , says häßler .
to protect hq 100aklima , you must have a minimum of 4 million euros invested in chickens , with the municipality receiving state aid of around 70 percent .
but häßler pointed out that it was only funding that was needed if an overall concept was implemented .
the municipality should be relied on the participation of the citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure would have to be completed .
at best , it could start implementation in 2016 .
among other things , the protection concept , which was adopted at the municipal council last week ( we reported ) , provides for local measures to be taken in the inflow of the irm river from the haftweim valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns .
among other things , it called into question why more dams and restraint basins are not planned to protect the place .
gregor kühn , technical planner of the commissioned engineering office wald and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal .
moreover , it is necessary to find the most economical solution , according to joachim wald von wald und corbe .
discontent reigned among altstadt ’ s residents , who were still in trouble , even during normal storms , when the channel network was overloaded .
the problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
however , häßler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed .
the municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration could be covered .
the sewage channels to be larger would cause millions to swallow .
the wounded
early friday afternoon , 44 people were on the provincial road near revensdorf and two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .
the police immediately blocked the street completely , but could not get a word about the accident .
however , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first .
it is clear that the 19-year-old steering of a vw golf was going to revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf is coming to her with his hyundai .
both vehicles were combined , with the woman so hard to climb in , that the fire brigade took just half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .
the real cause of the accident was not clear at first .
both devastated came to nearby hospitals .
the route remained closed for about two hours .
he could be the dostoevsky of the us .
philip k. dick was a godseeker , a metaphysicist , his novels and stories also have something serial .
amazingly , the kindness of the outside world : the stealthy eyes , the beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fjodor m. dostoevski , with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologist of the russian soul , reads the words of philip k. dick as american prophet .
some titles have been published by heyne publishing house , the haffman cassette with the 118 stories distributed two thousand .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security delusion and the belief that you are chosen .
dick had a god-experience , his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , drugs had added to his brain .
he has learned early that the machines divinities are .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person would like to distinguish from a machine that the creator from his creature .
this is the &quot; blade runner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have been written by film directors like ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority report &apos; dates back to 1956 , and exudes the smell of the cold war and the mccarthy tribunal .
the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is being developed here , &apos; pre-crime &apos; , that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick &apos;s world , which is the same as ours , mutants look to the future - and the police are attacking .
&quot; we collect individuals who do not violate any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we are snapping them before they commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a criminal offence full of pesudo criminals &quot; .
they assume that worst is happening , and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dick ’ s narrative looks like the blueprint for the anti-terrorist laws and the interception of nsa .
anticipation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dick ’ s story is not over yet .
the police chief complains that there are no separation of powers .
then the monitor itself is monitored and a future crime is transferred .
the system is rotating .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it invents its own prerequisites .
if errors and victims are not only accepted , but are built on it .
the system creates the danger that it is fighting against .
philip k. dick read is , time and again , coming closer to the truth .
late haffers around merkel in russia
the former us intelligence expert edward snowden may have been a little angry in the us late haphages for chancellor angela merkel to speak in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal bar service could either ask questions in writing or personally address the 30 year old in russia , interfax reported to the agency .
previously , the green federal deputy , hans-christian ströbele , had yesterday been the first german politician to meet snowden in moscow to talk to him about the affair .
nsa revelations reinforce company paranoia for state surveillance and control of the company .
on a mild day at the end of august , a german police helicopter flew deep over the us consulate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s capital .
on the instruction of the federal office for constitutional protection and the fight against terrorism ( bvt ) , the german internal intelligence service , it should be photographing the roof of the us state post , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to verify the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of wording between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us director of national intelligence , was in september insisting once again that the us has no foreign spike .
but since edward snowden , who became a whistleblower , former employees , began publishing his filling-horn to us surveillance secrets , the world has become increasingly aware of european governments and corporate leaders .
reports that the american national security agency has declared the brazilian oil company petrobas to be a pioneer and that data from american cloud suppliers , including google and yahoo , have been blocked by the company &apos;s paranoses .
the barrel overcame the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s telephone was twisted , possibly for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can be targeted , then corporate governance is also potential targets .
snowden has continued the intensive cooperation between us intelligence agencies and companies .
i think it is possible that these data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver green , president of bitmi , who is supporting small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us now poses almost as much a risk as china in terms of industrial espionage and data theft , such a poll that was published by the beraterfirm ey in july .
the snow-leaked documents revealed , however , that there was no evidence that the us had hidden the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu should be given certain it and internet facilities and that it should reduce its dependence on the us .
companies are sceptical about this .
the bundestag proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if you wanted a strong european it industry , you would not have been able to let it die 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsidised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , reach and technical refinement of the snowden hides have been revealed .
cloud computing is changing a lot because european business leaders are now more aware that in the us , stored data on the people in the cloud computing are subject to legal jurisdiction and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a study published by the cloud security alliance , a trading institution , the commission has published a survey of the most recent data protection laws in the united states .
jim snabe , deputy managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question of customers who have been asking it a year ago – it is : where will my data be stored and can you guarantee it ?
many german business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they have already been aware of , namely that powerful business leaders are losing their most valuable secrets .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed by the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
the americans are spying on us at commercial and industrial level , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
the management normally does not boast about the remedies that have been taken , because that gives attackers advantages .
in large companies , employees have long been involved in the idea that taking a free usb stick on a trade fair or the unguarded lying lung of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable , to say the least .
ulrich hackenberk , member of the board of automanufacturer audi , says that it has been standard practice for years to present the mobile phones before a board meeting , so that they are not used as tapping devices .
the german bvt advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they are on foreign trips , because smart phones are not likely to be compromised .
the prepaid phones will be thrown away afterwards .
there is , however , concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hacking and monitoring .
in germany , many of these companies are world market leaders in their respective niches .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access , ” warns bvt in a report .
the us warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , the us national intelligence estimate in february was france , russia , and israel ranked second in china , which became the world ’ s most important source of hacking service business data .
a member of the board of a german blue chip company agreed to the need for a policy of economic espionage , then “ are the french the worst ? ”
bernard squarcini , former head of the french home security service dcrl , was arrested this month in an interview with : “ the secret services know very well that they are all countries , even if they are fighting in the middle east .

kendrick johnson from valdosta in the state of georgia was arrested on 11 january in a upright mat , which was behind the grandstand in the school gymnasium .
sheriffs investigators from lowndes county came to the conclusion that the sheriff was a trapped man in a tragic accident , which was a serious concern for the family of the 17-year-old .
“ they are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said benjamin crump , the lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson , to foxnews.com.
they would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had .
&quot; they believe that it is unlogical to speak out against the laws of physics and against healthy behavior .
they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to school to learn and came back in the corpses , &quot; he commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
this was stated by moore at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts , in whatever direction you take .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe that a sufficient basis for a formal agreement on the matter is sufficient , ” he said .
moore explained to reporters who had initially interpreted autopsy as indicating that johnson was suffering the consequences of a “ position-related stiflation . ”
but a second autopsy has caused another death , says moore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added if there is sufficient evidence to justify criminal or civil action .
a representative of the sheriff county authority was in the office of the county sheriff at our request on thursday not immediately to comment .
a dish in southern georgia ordered a trial on wednesday that the authorities had to watch all the surveillance videos that the investigation had received .
the teenage parents said they hoped that the video recordings would give evidence of how he died .
cdc publish allergic guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease research ( ccccp ) published a report on the development of the disease control and prevention policy .
these are the first such directives that the us government has issued , as the number of people with school age allergies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now have a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has , according to the cdc , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are required to raise awareness of food allergies to teachers and staff and how children are to be dealt with , which may have an allergic reaction .
it is also recommended that schools teach epinephron – the auto-injection of the brand epipen is most often used – to counter a potentially lethal oversensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can be easily stolen from epinephron .
the report also lists typical symptoms that are referred to by children who have an allergic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is on my tongue , ” “ my tongue feels like it is a little bit like a hair on it ” or “ my tongue kribbelt ” .
parents of intersexual children can be chosen “ gender undetermined ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third gender recognised for children who are suffering from unclear genital conditions .
newborn children will no longer be stubbornly assigned to male or female .
under the new law , parents no longer need to declare sex for such children , but can “ undetermined ” or “ not determined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents to avoid making hasty decisions on operations for a sex education .
an intersexual person said , according to the bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain the patchwork that doctors have created , mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children die each year neither as a boy nor as a girl .
they are intersexual , a group that is included in the diagnosis of “ sexual disorder ” ( dsd ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , knees and bacteria .
wallis simpson was possibly intersexually .
understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but the majority of experts in the us recommend that you should read the best available information on gender assignment , if you do not have a provision , and not the psychological information .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who has focused on the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ blade for a good cause ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , ” he said .
you can assign a sexually transmitted disease without surgery and then see how the identity develops .
the scientific data on how a child can develop its gender identity are not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission in 2011 , it says that intersexual people are excluded from transsexual or transgender persons .
these characteristics were reflected in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , obathy , breasts and stature , priority treatment of sexual characteristics and sexual orientation .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is affecting intersexual and transgender people in working life and the extent of the harassment , violence and prejudice of women .
do not match the gender image , boys now have a special camp .
in the meantime , adults in australia and nepal have the opportunity to use official documents to write male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was the first “ sexless ” person worldwide to be recognised after a court had declared the lifetime maintenance of a “ undefined ” gender status .
german cards have a third chance of being assigned to m and w , x for intersexual. this is the ministry of the interior .
in neighboring france , gender issues are still controversial , such as news coverage .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” was removed from school books .
the american website catholic online has also been contrary to german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is shattered into a new state where the gender is a decision to take sexual activity but not , then it turns .
the mother of a newborn maryland declared to baby zone , she would find it better if babies were born at birth to have a sex .
&quot; parental existence is also possible without further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were born with both male and female gender were treated as children .
ten years ago , medicine looked at gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt .
but the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also able to lie wrong because they do not know how the child can feel when it grows up .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said drescher .
when such a child was born , the psychiatrist was not called , but the surgeon .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genital status goes back to dr. john money of the johns hopkins university , who held the view that gender is formable .
he used the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental approaches to gender equality – such as parents ’ – are not interacting with the people ’ s genes and hormones , and that they characterize them .
but in a report entitled “ john / joan ” , which was published in 1966 , his theories were controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis are not allowed to get rid of when they were boiled down to a cutlery and to leave his hods and then treat him as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” says drescher .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male sex and married a woman .
at 38 , however , he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the internet , survivors of these gender operations have come to the public , who “ are not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36 year-old author from montana who worked with xy male chromosomes , but double-hint genitalia .
doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never achieve a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so its external organ and the hodes were soon after birth in 1976 , surgically removed and he was pulled up as a girl .
at the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
“ i knew i was not a girl , ” he said to abcnews.com , “ i don ’ t know a girl , ” he said to abcnews.com .
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .
but , as he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , demanded a change in his medical records .
what he found out was shocking .
i was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that .
bruce was born with a dsd , through which his body did not testosterone enough to produce the genital development .
after he had learned the truth , he changed back to male identity , and testosterone injections , and settled down his breasts .
the surgery has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the california based company , is also a member of the advocates for informed choice .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a chance to “ assign ” , she declared .
we fear that this favours intervention .
we think it would be better to have the male or female sex and then to wait .
but we do not yet know how the law will work , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organization supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognized as the third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .
the german law is about the allocation of birth .
this is not a fight that small children should be forced to fight at this time .
if they are grown up , they can decide for themselves on their body .
but dr. arlene baratz , a pitiful brustradiologist who was a daughter with a sexual disorder of differentiation and has hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the law is .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a dsd called complete androgen resistance .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes walk from the main train station .
she has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovarian .
today katie 29 is married ; she is working at the university of pennsylvania as an employee in the psychiatry of children .
although it is infertile , it hopes that , by adoption or a surrogate mother , a child will be able to get .
“ the law gives parents room , which does not mean that they must make decisions in a hurried manner , ” baratz said .
it gives you the time to do different tests and to clarify things , giving you time before you can “ masculine ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is in order – you pull the child big and you love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness .
and you don ’ t have to hurry up to do an operation that can no longer be undone .
“ this includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are exiting because they believe that they are not going to do the right thing , ” explained she .
ultimately , the child decides on the gender that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make the decision themselves .
unknown injuring girls by shooting from car
unknowns have a 12-year-old in saxony-anhalt in shots from a car .
the perpetrators had been arrested on thursday evening in genthin with an air force on a group of children .
that was communicated by the police in burg .
the girl is easily injured at the left wade .
rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpetrators also went to a bus stop .
a disc broke .
they then drove from it .
the criminal police are investigating , it was said on friday .
until now , the police inspection can still take place in a calm halloween night .
officials were only sent to eigen-gathering children twice , who warned them of facades .
since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residue immediately , no material damage should have been caused .
furthermore , some sylvesterböller were ignited in the city area , but there is no material damage here either .
an inhabitant of the bischof friendor route reported that his car was loaded with a knock-on paper and his wheel-decorative apertures were stolen .
until the police arrive , the man has to change his wheel-shaped apertures in the immediate vicinity , so the police did not have to continue working .
living with a future perspective
waltraud ries actually lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .
the hotel is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; hopefully you don &apos;t have a fear of spinning ? &quot; , asked waltraud ries and pointed out a fat spider on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .
but you know how difficult this was in stuttgart .
the reason is not spinning phobia , however , but the concern to have the many stairways to the house and the apartment to be able to cope at age .
moreover , since a meniskus operation , the mid50 &apos;s has had to learn at their own pace what it means to deal with stockfloor handicaps .
recently , a book of her appeared on the theme &apos; happy living in old age - what is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what cannot be done at age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when they started their husband ’ s maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with fifty in the middle , waltraud ries thinks differently about this .
but she also knows that she is one of the few people who ever addressed the subject of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most people are squeezing it out as long as it is done .
the age always only becomes the other , &quot; she says joyfully .
only when the pressure of suffering is really great can one think .
&quot; then it may be too late , &quot; says ries .
in her book , interior designers put together 17 models for self-determined living in old age .
&quot; but which type of home you choose is always an individual choice , &quot; she explains .
d i e solution do not give it for age .
even those who wish to take the retirement home in tuscany or brittany should always consider that they are also sick .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the language of the country , you would also agree in the dolce vita , &apos; gives the registrar a consideration for people who want to study abroad .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pensioners &apos; wg .
at age , everyone has his own ticks and makings , and each one has his own fat and his own .
&apos;for me , such a community of living would be nothing , &apos; she means with a wink .
not like a student wg with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;in old age , you simply need your retreat rooms , &apos; says ries .
the fact that a community of senior citizens can still function , however , is not something that the author wants to exclude .
but that must be different from the classic student walls .
and sometimes you just want to have your rest &apos; , she believes .
it is in this opinion , at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;most old people in stuttgart want to stay in their own flat as long as possible &apos; , is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the provincial capital .
your service advises people on the topic of &apos; getting older &apos; .
therefore , it is older people who would often also find themselves with inconvenience and restrictions , just to stay in their habitual environment , which is also the experience of the foundation warentest .
there are many ways to find the house or apartment in a barrier-free manner .
ries recommends all those who are interested in the rebuilding of their home or apartment in accordance with the age of their lives to get informed and not to be the first to be the craftsman .
today , there are also specialists for the rebuilding of the right age .
even in the apartment you can find some things and if you are looking for the toilet seat increase , you can find the right solution for your interior .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age of the day and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
waltraud ries had to make this experience .
the room was very small , but the bathroom was very small .
she will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for her and her husband .
before moving , she is more than greeted at her home .
the us wants to continue prosecuting snowden
the us has changed its stance on former us intelligence official edward snowden .
he was still accused of passing on secret information illegally .
therefore , he must face criminal proceedings in the us , said the spokesperson of the us state department , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by snowden would not change that either .
previously , german green politician hans-christian ströbele had asked about the issue of the “ green party ” following a meeting with snowden in moscow .
psaki stressed that streams of rhetoric were those of a parliamentarian , not the words of a german member of the government .
intelligence enthüller edward snowden is generally invited to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to know his situation .
this is what the former nsa employee sought from the us did in an unaddressed letter , which the green politician hans-christian sent to russia .
the letter has been sent after a translation spread by ströbele :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to give you a letter about your mass surveillance investigation .
my name is edward joseph snowden and i was previously contracted or directly appointed as a technical expert in the national security agency ( ncp ) .
as a result of my work in these institutions , i have witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which have led me to act out of moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persistent heat which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in exile and enjoy temporary work .
i am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens all over the world , as well as senior officials - including the united states - have made the revelations a system of all-embracing surveillance that nobody is accountable for , a service to the public .
this spy revelations brought many proposals for new laws and directives , which are based on the previously hidden legacy of public confidence .
the benefits to society from these findings will increasingly be clearer ; at the same time , the risks that have been accepted have been visibly reduced .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissens as a breach of loyalty and seeks to criminalise political expression and to indict it .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will take this negative position .
i hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in the responsible investigation of the issues relating to the violence that has been made in the media , particularly with regard to truth and authenticity .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is settled and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .
edward snowden testifies to his work with hans-christian ströbele .
kindergarten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the gartenstraße has sold the commune to a private person .
the local council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , emphasises maier .
the budget had eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .
the mayor is right that winterlingen should take responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and thus no longer pay for the entertainment of the house , as was the case with heating , after the garden and looking for the garden .
&quot; this effort is now gone &quot; , maier is happy .
concert at high summer temperatures
the musikverein hammereisenbach gives a concert on the terrace of the inn hammer .
as conductor bianca willmann at 7.30 p.m. , he raises the clock , the thermometer still shows 25 degrees .
about 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of hammricher musicians .
the chairman manuela honeck explains the music .
in this context , honeck thanked all those who helped to create the first music hock successfully .
report : obama campaign considered to replace biden with hillary clinton .
president barack obama ’ s closest advisers have deliberated in secret to allow vice-president joe biden to be replaced by hillary clinton in the 2012 election campaign , according to the new york times .
the revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann on the 2012 campaign , “ double down : gazette change 2012 . ”
times is a copy of the upcoming release of the book and you will be reporting on thursday evening on the new york times .
according to jonathan martin , the national correspondent of the times , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff , namely the president of the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaigns ’ infrastructure in chicago and the oval office .
only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including daley , former obama ’ s campaign leader , jim messina , and the former white house ’ s chief adviser , david axelrod , and david .
in double down , it is claimed that daley was at the forefront of efforts to sell biden despite its “ close , personal relationship . ”
in an interview with martin , dalyan confirmed that the government had indeed considered replacing biden with clinton .
“ i said a whole series of things that could be considered , and that was one of them , ” said daley to the magazine .
it is important to remember that the president at that time had terrible polls , so we thought : “ for god ’ s sake , what are we doing ? ”
while daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” martin told anderson cooper of cnn that , during the campaign for re-election , considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a move was possible .
“ campaigns do not spend as much money on polls and focus groups when they are not seriously reflecting on something , ” martin said at ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that his team had thought about an exchange .
martin said to cnn that he asked daley if his boss at the time was aware of the potential change .
although daley said that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware ” , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that obama would have known about it .
martin added that “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations of obama ’ s desk had reached .
cooper asked martin if he seriously think obama has not heard of the investigation into whether to accept bids in the elections .
“ possible , ” martin replied .
what happens to my email when i am on the road ?
e-mail actually means electronic letter .
was similar to the email in the design of the internet service , was it technically transposed into letter secrecy ?
in designing early internet services , the main focus was on making communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been designed to provide a solid basis for a heart-safe exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; an &quot; benni &quot; sends an e-mail , the hosts of the two are connected directly ?
the email program or browser of anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .
for example , if you have a gmail account , the gmail would be .
this mail server sends the content to the provider that banni uses .
on the route , the mail can be run via a number of other servers on the internet .
bennie can then call the content from its provider .
if conventional e-mails are sent along their way through the network ?
most mails are sent several times by software robots on the go .
the sender &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail is a malicious program as an appendix .
on the receiver systems , a virus check is also carried out .
furthermore , providers check that this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least inserted into a spam folder .
if the robots have another task ?
on systems like gmail , the robot also detects the information that google needs to place context advertising .
if anna and benni are informed about the next holiday by gmail , google can provide appropriate links to holiday offers .
read also unknown people who are receiving e-mails ?
the likelihood that unauthorized persons will receive an e-mail is extremely low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mails .
the law enforcement and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or notify e-mails .
in addition , possible illegal compensation actions are also being taken .
is it possible to send e-mails to prevent reading ?
with an encryption according to the openpgp standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .
it is also possible to use metadata of an e-mail communication with a high technical effort , so that it is not even easy to identify who is communicating with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the email market in germany ?
the mainly privately used mailboxes are yahoo and google , according to an investigation by convios consulting in august 2013 , playing only a minor role .
while yahoo mail ’ s shares were last down , gmail could significantly increase from google .
mother in the forest dismayed and retired cassies
when his busy mother died , a man from wolfsburg forged a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care money .
to continue to pay pensions and care fees , the company has developed a 67-year-old wolfsburger who died after investigations by the police in the forest .
first , he has bewitched the death of the 89 year-olds , then he has spent more than a year and a half on the money .
now , the 67 year old must be held responsible for fraud , as one speaker said on friday .
so the man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
the man was suspected in may : at that time , the nursing staff were forced to accept medication .
the investigators told pensioners that his mother had travelled to spain .
because officials have been strangely aware of this , they have continued to determine .
it came to the conclusion that the two had been living in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had nurtured them last .
the 67 year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an obduction did not indicate any evidence of a capital crime .
want to have an ice cream that glows in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has the first in the dark light ice – using qualms .
charlie francis made the fluorescent properties of the sea animals to the advantage of creating a new leafy whiskey .
the idea came to him after he had read a research on jellyfish and had chinese scientists persuaded him to artificially produce the luminous protein .
the ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed , which reduces the ph in the protein and reduces the luminosity .
chris explains that the ice cream responds to the warmth of the mouth and luminaire – so the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company &quot; lick me i &apos;m delicious &quot; , says : &quot; the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so gets you two grams of it for 200 grams .
the ice cream used reacts with the tongue in a neutral protein .
when the mouth warm the protein , the ph value increases and the ice is lit .
we have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to see it on halloween .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i have ever made , because the light source is four times tougher than gold .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but it tastes delicious .
charlie &apos;s experimental company , based in bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , wine and wine .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to develop an invisible ice cream ’ .
that is impossible in itself because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals .
the ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a jellyfish that are artificially produced by chinese scientists .
tsv morsum has been released after six days of the game without any point in the handball league .
it is now , of all things , the very day that the team of ingo ehlers will be the derby against tsv daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
this game starts the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have our head free &quot; , ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
at last , with the exception of the endurance injured hendrik blohme , he has his complete cadre at his disposal .
like us , it is also based on speed play .
we must therefore keep our error rate low .
but , first and foremost , we need to increase the coverage that , at the last moment , has left anything but a certain impression .
the hotel is much more relaxed , but it is also the first season winner of the north horn .
the game was , of course , a house number .
but that is why we are still far from being the favourite , because everything can happen in the derby .
nevertheless , panitz now wants to explore morsum to start a series .
jan-malte jodat is missing .
for this reason joost windsrush , a young a-teenager , who enjoys double playing rights at the hc bremen a-jugendliche bundesligist , is celebrating his season debut .
if you don &apos;t get hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
helloween 2013 : in numbers
when i was small , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to eat sweets , to stay late and to dress up for the neighborhood .
today i am more interested in the halloween muffle .
in the last two years , i have not agreed to move from my home to sweets , and i am sure i will not do so this year either .
but according to statistics , i am a black sheep in terms of halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes , and decorations , according to the us association of merchants .
one thing i can focus on each halloween then is the trendsetting values .
the costumes will cost about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the nrf .
this year , exciting uninanimate objects are the last cry .
women no longer need to wear sexy clothes , they can now also eat seductive food like pizza , hamburgers or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk space founders will not be able to put it into the instagram feeds this year .
according to google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
we have sold our dogs last year and were thus astonished not to my surprise .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
as for sweets , we are not foolish .
americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
this is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lucerne , candy and rubber beans .
so good news for the us department of commerce &apos;s 41 million people who are associated with the sweets or sour phrase .
indeed , we will be able to produce over 40 million kilos of chocolate for halloween and – let us not fool ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is the sweet candy corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
that is about nine billion maize grains .
it is a mystery that i have not yet been able to solve .
nothing belongs to halloween more than houses where there is spuct .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which , incidentally , is a real prison ) , “ howl-o-scream ” , and “ the house of shock . ”
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognized spuces in the united states that have saved $ 500 million , according to america haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos of the world .
but let us finally get to the bumps .
charlie brown made us into a knife when we were children , and carving a shortened latern is like decorating the christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend only began last year thanks to pintest , so most of us grew up with the pumpkin to cut it and not to sit inside it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on a shortcut , according to the us census bureau .
the shortened lamps , which are slowly rotated in the front garden , are probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of pumpkin harvest were harvested .

flats in helmbrecht : rescue forces are bergen coiled corpses of corpses , coiled corpses , and the corpses are covered with a coated corpus .
the fire brigade had to be fired at helmbrecht on thursday evening .
a three family house in the county of hof catches fire on friday night .
the rescue forces are a coiled corpse from the house .
rescue workers have lost out in helmbrecht in a fire and have a coiled corpse in a three-family house .
whether it is a resident handle is still unclear how a spokesman of the police in bayreuth said .
on thursday evening , there was a meeting of the staff on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already sounding out of a window .
the staff went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room burned out completely .
the whole ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police officer explained further .
the building is not habitable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest regional church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .
background is a possible shortage of parish : the evangelic-lutheran church of hannover expects that the church of st. petersburg will increase to a total of 1,800 pastors .
for today ’ s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to keep the workflow and the day to day .
with burfia , the local church has for the first time commissioned a pastor to appoint young people for theology studies .
at present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after graduation .
burfia is leading this to the process of secularisation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
the profession of great freedom and diversity was a symbol of this .
i am the master of my calendar and can set my priorities where i think it is important .
pastors could be seen as a soulbound closest to the people .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well .
certainly , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer for that .
this is something that will benefit today &apos;s young people , who are not only concerned with careers , but also with a mind-filled job .
according to the national church , which represents three quarters of lower saxony , about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .
at the same time , about 40 graduates of a theological studies start their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , emsland and wendland , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
burfien wants to host , among other things , study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .
the study of theology offers a broad range of training .
you can even become president of the federal republic .

fire brigade to save a bitch that is 15 meters above ground on a dangerous rock .
cockerspaniel-bitch ruby was out of service after a minor road accident .
three days later , a walker in the quarry , in her dire position , discovered her .
firemen rolled on a rock wall and saved the dog from the safe distance .
the fire brigade succeeded in keeping a dog safe , which was on a 15-metre high lead in a rocky wall .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was born on wednesday from a stone quarry .
scott alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend becky hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire to return to ruby .
they had been desperate for their missing female and helped them to get help in social networks .
about 2 : 15 p.m. on wednesday , a walker saw his dog go to the village of kabul , and he was walking on the 15-metre high section in the quarry .
the technical rescue team of the cleckheaton fire station rushed to the spot and rolled to save ruby &apos;s from the station , which was then in a dog box upwards .
andy clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was located in the middle of the cliff – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
she did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .
but now it is doing well .
she then gave a few cakes for the dog .
that was a rather unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ ruby had a giant accident . ”
it was possible that it was seriously injured or worse .
ruby was brought to the vet to investigate , but he was not allowed to see anything except exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall of halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ in saving the world , fear was disconcerting . ”
i could not believe that she really was up there .
it was wonderful to see them back in the arms .
the vet explained when exhaustion became too big and it would collapse , it would probably have fallen .
the firemen have done a great job .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keghley added : “ we were afraid that they would fall , but they were still up . ”
the firemen were great .
i can hardly believe where she was .
mick jagger explains that he never made katy perry when she was 18 .
in an interview with an australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been playing as a background singer at jaggers song “ old habits die hard ” from 2004 .
perry explained that she had to spend the evening with the altrocker , and that “ he drew me up when i was 18 . ”
it added : “ this has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of jaggers , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categorically refuses to accept any rapprochement ever made with katy perry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she was confusing him with someone else . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling stons tour this year .
her new album “ prism ” was released on the 1st place this week .
george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice of a single choice .
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we are warned that an independent scotland is needed to help the schengen area as a condition for the eu &apos;s membership .
this is the key word for stories about passport controls in berwick and a world of barbed wire border controls along the hadrian wall .
indeed , in the strathclyde proposal , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that would mean more freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was – as expected – not included in the headlines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often have to comply with their strict rules when it is more convenient for them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , the continued failure to take account of brussels would be only a small concession in exchange for what we really expect from the scots .
so no story .
and one that has already come in the years that you already have a fossil : the first time i &apos;ve seen the &quot; independence means passport control &quot; duck at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point in this is the constant repetition of this ancient history .
why should we expect an independent scotland to be able to operate under the european pipe ?
why the london yoke against the brussels one , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great war resolution that was adopted to unite europe has stalled .
the euro crisis has officially killed the european project .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the eu or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic alternative party could – only established this year – vote for almost five million in the federal election in september .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federalist europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
the financial crisis imposed by berlin and the european central bank , together with the straitjacket into which the national economy is plunged by sticking to the single currency , make many people in the view that the project europe is a major project .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments ’ excessive budget deficits – that was only true in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has imposed currency exchange rates on its members , which are beneficial to german exporters – and that is what german politicians want to leave .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage against germany .
the only way is to increase wages and public spending – spurred by berlin .
behind the current etat and monetary problems lies a deeper european productivity growth problem .
as a result of the green energy policies imposed by brussels – a code for the subsidisation of french and german energy companies to the detriment of consumers – the european industry pays a lot more than the united states .
this is a crippling cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in granemouth .
all wage fixing in the world protects the european petrochemical industry not from being hit by cheap american shale gas .
as a result , a revolt is dragging on , especially in france , the former chief escort of the eu .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle for getting germany into trouble .
but berlin needs paris no more as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has put europe on its own economic policy , which is what the troubled french economy is struggling with .
the result : marine le pen ’ s more right-wing , anti-eu front national has just won a decisive re-election , thereby forcing the ruling socialists to rank three .
the front national is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party , that it is not assuming that a division will be found in the right spectrum automatically benefits the right spectrum .
what makes le pen so popular with its newly won popularity among the white french of the working class ?
it wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to launch an anti-eu , anti-community monetary block in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the european parliament .
this is the point i want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the eu and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that general de gaulle favored .
germany and some of its satellite economies may be sticking to the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own currencies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain alone can achieve more than $ 200 billion in the atlantic .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to build a region of ( ultimately ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including berlin and brussels , what they want to see , and that includes – what they can put where they are .
i suspect that scotland could be in a looser european union , provided that we have our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is essential in a non-federated europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider equating norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland – remarkably , the government ’ s most successful political movement against the austerity policies of europe – has achieved a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and undertaken ) cuts .
it would be ridiculous for scotland to opt for independence now only to be able to demand austerity from berlin and brussels .
early puberty : grow up faster
african and hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white contemporaries , as studies show .
physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty .
there is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible , and that they are not harmful to human health .
experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among young people .
the former cnn correspondent pat etheriddge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues .
should a mother be worried if her daughter is already seven or eight years old and she has breasts and shamhairs growing ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of paediatricians , the association of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaspecrinologist dr. paul kaspeckafer declared that this week .
“ i spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally this is no sign that the time has come to change . ”
obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hair , as well as body odor , appear earlier in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche ( first blood incidence ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; when breast development begins , it takes at least two to three years to reach the menarche , &quot; said kaplowitz , also author of the book “ early puberty in girls : the essential adviser .
time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .
there is controversy as to what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early breast feeding ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years .
in most cases , the process or stagnant – a bit that a child doctor has to monitor closely .
if progress is faster , tests could be carried out by an endikronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts .
there are methods for delaying early menstruation and preventing a different consequence : the premature use of ageing of bones , ultimatitis to stimulate growth and thus cloning small body growth .
the recommendations for a medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reluctant about drugs , but he acknowledges that “ the suppression of puberty can cause behavioural problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their peers .
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
&quot; they worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they can improve hygienic aspects &quot; , said kaplowitz .
“ it was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter , with ten days , remembers .
although there were initial signs and we were talking about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .
she was frightened and excited by school to go home because she was the first in her group .
there are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .
but there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are contained in milk or other food , chemicals , in the environment or sexual health .
boys come to puberty in a similar way to girls .
kaplowitz believes that the most compelling premise is the epidemic of obesity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who had a connection between bodily fat and admission to puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that play a role .
in that country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white contemporaries .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another puzzle : although boys have the facial and shambea already sooner , the trend to a full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as girls .
other aap doctors stressed the complexity of the system .
the appearance of acne and shamhair is even more important for babies and infants .
“ we must be careful how we can prevent the real beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at goryeb childre .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician about how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you can talk earlier than expected , ” said kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who bloom early need insurance that undermines the process as a normal part of life , even if they were previously thought to enter .
jumbo manufacturers argue against the market in the face of large orders over seating width and height , while large orders are facing large orders .
there is a great deal of conflict between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights , which is the tone for a bitter collision on the dubai airshow this month .
the dispute is about the width of the seat , passengers are being denied seats on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which the airlines are most concerned , but this is a proven space .
airbus this week demanded a standard in the industry that would have a seating width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the us archrival boeing is saying that it should .
the debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are beating about it , even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range flies are becoming available , and at the event of the 17th to 21st november , record orders are expected .
like the rear part of the aircraft – especially if it includes nine or ten seats – the aircraft is crucial for the specified economic results , which the new “ minim-jet-jumbo ” design is intended to deliver .
boeing claims that its modernized “ 77x ” fasse 406 people are seated in the tourist class , which has 17 inches wide and thus ten per row .
airbus says that the competing a350 is 350 passengers in 18 inch capacity .
aircraft giants often share the technical details of advertising in the technical press .
airbus is now appealing to the dubai airshow , where the 777x , with more than 100 orders , is expected to take the race , directly to the public .
recently , the company issued an ad indicating the beginning of a new ad war and providing financial donors with an image of three people being squeezed together in a restaurant , and the title : “ would you do that ? ”
“ boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says airbus ’ sales director john leahy .
with dietary changes changing , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970 ’ s , when boeing 747 launched the modern long-distance journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average american has dropped from 40 to 49 years by 10 % .
the waist range of the male average american in the 21st century is , according to us health statistics , 100.8 cm .
airbus says that its rival is sticking to a concept of seats from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly baptized “ jet set ” was smaller .
airbus has investigated the effects of the crisis on the environment and the environmental impact of the crisis .
boeing denies airbus ’ figures for the size of its seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines can strike the balance between airline fares and the establishment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience in the aircraft hangs from more than the width of the seat .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility to make them do what they want to do , ” she said .
you do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
passengers are more elbow freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be difficult to deal with a subject that affects the turnover .
behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades , which will have a lasting impact on the export balance of the us or europe .
as reuters first reported in july , the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new jets .
both airbus and boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design .
boeing &apos;s statements on the results depend in part on the 777x being the largest in the world , with ten seats per row , with nine seats in the 777 original design .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than the current 10 seat machines for each series .
“ boeing squeezes more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products ” , says kevin kenisson , head of passenger aircraft comfort at the european airline industry .
on the other hand , analysts say that full 10-seat cabins for existing 777s indicate that many passengers are in favour of closer arrangement , which is cheaper than the airline .
“ eighteen inch seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is very different from the threat posed by the 777 “ , says mary .
airbus and boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airline companies can choose .
the world traveller jet sellers even carry bandwidth to make the equipment more competitive .
even if you add comfort to your product , all manufacturers offer jets with high density finishes for cheap prices .
airbus offers a ten-seater a350 , but it says it has not yet sold one .
until recently , airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability in the cabins and of providing broad seats to the commuter .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to disappear , but will be replaced by the wave of 77x sales .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could help to prevent smoking from happening .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that reduces the fun of smoking .
a single dose of the vaccine could kill mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .
before human tests , further tests are needed , which may take several years , but professor ronald crystal is a very good man .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and stop all of the drugs available on the market .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to contain the genetic information to produce nicotine infections .
the virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then generate a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they leave the brain .
in trials , vaccinated mice that nicotine has been administered kept their normal level of activity .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time off , ” the researchers declared , a sign that nicotine had reached her brain .
the experiments are published in the journal science translational medicine .
previous tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the antibody level as often as possible , and they were expensive and impractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .
as professor crystal said , a future vaccine could be used to treat people who are quite sure of being administered before they are tried .
but it is more likely that smokers will use it to stop .
&quot; you know then : if you start smoking again , you will feel a bit annoying about the nicotine vaccine and that will help you to get rid of habits , &quot; explains dr. j. k. j. k.
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .
tripodi denies , influenced by obeid , has been the subject of the &quot; the &quot; .
the former labour minister joe tripodi from new south wales is being accused of a european public corruption investigation .
former nsw minister denies that the maritime surveillance arrangements are being reviewed at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who has been concealed in three areas .
the independent commission assessment board ( cccp ) is an independent committee of the european commission on corruption and corruption .
now , because of the accusation , tripodi has been killed by obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after tripodis had replaced former deputy chevron lynne .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had insisted on public tenders for leased contracts .
the poets were opposed to this and also wanted longer maturity .
in 2009 , leased contracts for the companies were signed on the circular quay , which awarded the above $ 2.5 million annually without any public tender .
tripodi , which runs from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , originally opted for public tendering .
but he refused to accept the changes at obeid ’ s request , who , like tripodi , insisted on a transformation of leased government regulations .
one of the icac telephone conversations was published in august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry after he was under beid .
“ was this the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial packaging regulations ? ” the deputy chairman of the commission , anthony whealy tripodi , asked .
“ no , ” tripodi replied .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter aircraft attack targets in syria , so official sources suggest .
israeli jagged planes could have been a target on thursday night in the syrian port of latakia , confirmed by a senior government official to fox news .
the official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .
according to the associated press , the target was russian sa-125 missiles .
at least twice this year , israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ tested on the grounds of authenticity . ”
the government is thinking of a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457-visa as part of extended measures .
if the test were introduced , it would have a criterion in place to prevent the 457-07-11 being used to fill unskilled jobs or to serve as a back door for the relocation of family and friends to australia .
today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former labour meps , maxine mckeckew , had read the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ loud statements like that foreigners should sit back and sit back ” and , australians first set themselves up , are a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she told the indian institute .
historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and that if some in the region were to echo this historic artefact , the world would not have been surprised .
the proposal for discussion outlines 12 measures that were once taken by former immigration minister chris bowen .
immigration minister brendan o &apos;connor , who was in charge of talks yesterday on sri lanka in human trafficking , has identified five of the recommended amendments that are being made , and others are still being considered .
if the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , someone who has a visa may apply for it to be checked to see whether “ the application is accepted in real cases ” .
companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders who have been issued in the past , after companies that initially had only a small number of workers wanted to support were hacked .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan asylum seeker probably died from a heart attack after he was killed by a refugee boat this week on christmas island .
the disrupted nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to australia has been arrested since the death of his father on wednesday by an adult cousin who is also on the boat .
australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital , where he died .
the british government has announced a study which will examine the advantages of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd , it is proposed to start phase 1 in 2026 to provide high-speed connections between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project ‘ will bring britain closer ’ .
scottish transport minister keith brown said that he was very pleased to be able to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between london and the west midlands .
after the completion of phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between london and nordengland from eur 32.7 billion to gbp 42.6 billion .
the british government , which has been in talks with transport scotland , has asked hs2 ltd to look for further route capacities and travel time improvements for northern england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less by glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national network that will bring britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are moving forward with hs2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we face a crisis in capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to hs2 .
the scottish secretary of state , alistair carmichael , said : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called on him to “ unequivocally ” support scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said , “ the high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for scotland , while at the same time providing economic strength for scotland .
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to improve the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the glasgow-edinburgh link complementary to scotland &apos;s government .
i look forward to discussing the investigation report with the british ministers next year and to working together to take the next steps .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
australian air passengers must continue to buy tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the us to improve the rules for such devices .
the us federal aviation administration ( faa ) is a joint venture between us airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can be kept informed during critical flight phases .
during most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to use their e-books when they start and land .
australian societies are watching the decision to implement which us airlines have done a lot of work to accomplish , but are not pursuing immediate plans to change their rules .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment were not met at critical flight phases in australia .
“ casa currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” said .
the subject is covered by provisions that allow airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to use the safety requirements issued by cabin crew .
virgin has already had discussions with casa about extending the use of his wi-fi entertainment system to flights .
“ we would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this will improve the customer experience after we have ( wire and cable entertainment ) been released during the flight ” , said one .
qantas explained that , until further notice , the current rules will remain .
“ our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change this , ” explained the company .
faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will inform us of the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies , depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are able to tolerate radio disturbances caused by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruction .
“ after an airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can refuse to allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones in every height ” , said .
in rare cases , when the view is poor , the crew will instruct the passengers to remove the equipment during the landing .
the group also recommended that heavier devices be safely placed under the seat or compartment when starting and landing .

it was an unusual , almost speculative acoustics , which turned out to be a real eye-catcher until just before the start of the bundesliga match between german vice champion borussia dortmund and the vvlr .
the audience was mostly listening to their songs .
the south gallery , on the other hand , where the fairest of the faithful - and loudest - bvb fans were , at first , exceptionally quiet : no songs , no slaughter calls .
the podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint humidification , remained unfilled .

the fact that stadium spokespersons norbert dickel have once again experienced the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract extension of trainer jürgen klopp - listed une .
only five minutes before the start of the game the capo knocked his podest - and the hitherto almost palpable strain with hands was removed in a loud cry when thick .
finally , as always , the south gallery was on the side - and finally here again , as usual , was the loudest place in the stadium .
and at the latest when the südere audience was able to hear the loudly call &quot; derby winner &quot; , the whole thing was again .
silence before that was probably a reaction to what has happened over the last few days .
just before revierderby at fc schalke 04 , some of the bvb fans who were travelling with light missiles had been taken into the audience ranks and into the square - almost goalkeepers .
the game was played due to the chaotic scenes belatedly .
bvb-boss hans joachim watzke had the tips of the dortmund ultras then received in his office - and you think watzke &apos;s words were that for the fantasies this was rather an .
&quot; it is massaged for the whole ultra movement , &quot; said the bvb boss on thursday , february 10 , at a podium discussion in frankfurt .
as an emergency measure , watzke banned the ultras from choreography for the home game against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden this , &quot; he said .
the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics cannot be abandoned .
in addition , the ultras have been shown various possibilities for punishment - until tuesday they have time to choose one .
otherwise , he said , the bvb will remain in place until the end of next week .
&quot; this will be drastic &quot; , insured watzke .
it is important to be curious as to how the reactions in the south gallery will turn out .
pfandhaus booming in singapore , as the crisis has arrived in the middle class .
in a pfandhaus in the bendemeer shopping centre in singapore janani amirthalinga exudes a golden armoury , a ring and a few earrings to pay the school fees .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says amirthalinga .
although she has 3,000 singapore dollars each month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative employee and her husband also work , the monthly family income does not go up , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where household debt is increasing – has fallen so large that valuemax , where it has lost its exchange , has been the third pfandbrief this week to sell to the bank .
the pledging of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as a gift .
typically , pfandhaus in singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 percent , which is just over the 15.4 percent that united east asia holds .
however , pfandhaus offers the advantage that there is no verification of creditworthiness or income proof , which is why loans are possible faster than banks can .
this is why millions of people in the region are turning to pfandhaus , after families have been subjected to pressure from rising living costs and increased household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies , families with lower and middle incomes are looking for deposit houses to help with stotter economic differences .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing budget debt , mainly due to rising mortgage lending , as a risk factor for credit rating .
malaysia , thailand and singapore estimate that the agency has the highest budget debt in asia relative to gdp .
malaysia , with 80 % of gdp , is at the top of the list , a 60 % increase in 2008 .
economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which was just about to emerge from a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export check and a drop in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that , with costs rising , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to raise their income , where they are possible . ”
historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have reversed the trend to pledging personal items , as people have taken the opportunity to buy the jewelry of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items are sold in the 200 pathways of the city state of gold .
people say : “ the price of gold looks good , let us be grandmother ’ s gold chain and next month get back . ”
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has a 20-percent share of customers in its branches in the last few months .
growth in the deposit business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the branch in bendeceer and 15 others in singapore , is not only investing in neighbouring malaysia – where the company wants to expand – where it .
the company finances 60 percent of singapore ’ s $ 66 million , which it will be able to raise this week with the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders are coming into the crossfire because of high interest rates , yeah explains that pfandhaus is not only cheaper interest than other lenders , but also does not directly increase debt .
“ clients borrow items they already own , and the liquefied personal valuables do not increase household debt “ , explains the president .
the mortgage business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secure financing in society .
nor are all the people who use pfandleloan in financial difficulty .
rich singapore people also come to the valuemax branches to buy gold bars and rolex watches .
we are the home of customers from every social class .
“ this includes wealthy people who want to do something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that are experiencing cash flows bottlenecks , ” says yeah .
sometimes you just need money very quickly .
nsa absorbs data from google and yahoo - snowden wants to help you to save time and money .
the secret service reveler edward snowden has a fundamental interest in helping germany to clarify the increasingly explosive world of nsa late birds .
according to the presentation of the green party member hans-christian ströbele , his surprising meeting with snowden in russia was about creating the conditions under which the former intelligence staff would be able to work in a german public prosecutor ’ s office or in russia .
snowden had to deal with his complicated legal situation , said ströbele to the ard magazine &quot; panorama &quot; .
rescue package of over 325 million australian dollars for tasmanian health services
the australian government insists on the tough conditions imposed by the bailout of more than 325 million australian dollars for tasmanian health care , to ensure that the world ’ s government does not lose the country ’ s money .
federal minister for health tanya plonsek announced that the commonwealth will be called “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases .
funding for a period of four years was established after government consultations with independent tasmanian member andrew wilkie .
“ the government has launched an emergency rescue package , which will , in our view , meet the unique challenges facing the federal state .
the ddlr 325 million package is worth $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .
with a further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey star , residues are to be eliminated .
there is also money for day clinics in hobart and launceston , better post-stationary care after stays that are fachart training , services in the area of mental health and the introduction of a system of electronic communication .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that i have been told by hospital workers that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , ” said tanya plonsek .
the minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the tasmanian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the commonwealth , and monthly payments to the state to help finance the additional money .
a commission of three will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ it were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would strengthen tasmanian public health systems in a more sustainable way . ”
despite this , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent help , which he first asked the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to improving the public health system of the state from the list of worries , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts .
but the opposition ’ s public health spokesman , peter dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ plaster solution . ”
“ we are in the current situation because the government of the lab has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to abc tv .
it is unacceptable that a government should spend nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and that the commonwealth should be able to invest 300 million and then do so as if the good news were good news .
dutton called upon pllibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
guillaume nicloux &apos; adaptation of the novel by denis diderot impresses with its extraordinary production facilities and contemporary details , but is also heavier food than is necessary .
the &quot; monumental &quot; plot , which was played in france in the 1760s , tells the exciting story of suzanne , a young nobleman who was sent to the monastery by her family .
when she rebelled , she was confronted with the extreme cruelty of a very sadistic oberin and became the object of erotic fascination of another .
the film never slides into lusternity or sensational lust – and that is his problem .
the solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a quainous book for the audience too .
syria has a chance to make chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group , and a security group , which has been established by a surveillance group , including a security group , to prevent the use of weapons .
syria has important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and git gas ammunition , declared the global chemical and chemical weapons monitoring group on thursday , while it is building severe collapses in the north of the country near one of the sites .
also on thursday , a syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been living in the country since the civil war began soon three years ago .
the announcement by the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the date of the day before the date of the day on 6 february .
1 november , which the hague based organisation , damascus , set to use all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons .
the conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable that is geared towards destroying all chemical weapons of syria by mid-2014 .
the destruction of the facilities means that syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , must begin to exploit existing weapons and supplies .
supposedly , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when battles were taking place in the city of safira on thursday , by experts saying that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , such as those in the united kingdom .
the group of activists who have been arrested by a network of activists in syria declared the death of their people on thursday , 120,296 .
of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children , were killed .
on the government side , 29,954 of them were owned by president bashar assad &apos;s army , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 lebanese hizbollah militias .
also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 at 100,000 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has led to around two million refugees from the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that there were losses on both sides on thursday , but it did not mention details .
the fighting underlines the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the middle of a deadly civil war .
according to the opcw , which cooperates closely with the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will be able to implement all the important production and mixing / filling facilities that syria has mentioned and experience their destruction . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”
at the beginning of the week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of reviews and that they had completed 21 of the 23 sites mentioned by damascus .
because of security concerns , it was not possible to visit two institutions , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to syrian statement , and the objects of the chemical weapons program that exist there had been transferred to other named facilities that were inspected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site in safira was one of the two facilities that the opcw inspectors could not visit .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be approved next month by the opwc executive committee .
&quot; i am taking care of the bravery and courage that they all have in fulfilling the challenging challenges of the world .
for three years now , the mainly sunni muslim rebels have been fighting assad ’ s government and security forces in this civil war , which has killed many alawites .
in view of further developments , the head of the observatory , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in a syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .
anger at the judgement of bali bombers
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bali bombing were reacted by the angry people at the judgment of the last of the instigators who was brought to justice .
patek , who has been elected as one of the most sought after people in south-east asia for just under ten years , was awarded yesterday for his role in building warheads for the bombing .
by suspending a penalty , he could be released after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of kuta , near which 202 people died .
a guilty sentence was also found in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of spurious explosives .
the prosecutor had been charged a life sentence , even if it was not applicable to the man who was convicted of being a master bomb builder because of his reputation as a “ demolition man ” .
the decision has painful memories of june corteen , a mother of perth who had her 39 years old twins .
fighting tears she said patek had become the dead .
i really think he should be in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should protect him from a shooting command , &quot; said corteen , a former aap officer .
i have to live every day with the fact that i will not get any more grandchildren and i will never see my daughters again .
the sari club was made to the ground when the first club was opened shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 october 2002 in a small vent that was destroyed before the night club .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar where he was a suicide bomber just 20 seconds earlier , a man with explosives filled up a backpack .
he fell in love with the coma for a month after the attack and died three times while he was working on a life preservation system .
hughes said patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell jemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhlas , and imam samudra – who were responsible for the death .
really , this type should be given the death penalty before all the others .
keep it alive – no , there is no reason to keep it alive .
to get 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much .
patek is the last of the bali bombers who stood in court .
he escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually arrested in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were attacked by former al-qaeda leader osama bin sama just four months later .
during the negotiation , a fbi agent said that intelligence reports would inspire that the government had not been able to engage in military action .
“ he did not stand up , ” said corteen .
until recently , he has not shown any remorse at how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was issued before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which coincided with commemorations in bali and australia .
“ this year there will be many tears , ” said corteen .
patek may appeal against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls ) .
air passengers can now travel from the departure to the landing for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching movies that are not compatible with the mobile phone .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , faa staff michael huerta explained on a press conference .
the airlines must prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have read the airline staff training manuals and the rules on the stowage of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the faa stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would allow the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft .
among these airlines were delta and jetblue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices , ” said faa in a statement .
at present , passengers need to purchase smartphones , tablets , and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light .
the hotel must be at least 18 months from the date of arrival and must not be resumed before the aircraft has landed .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are insured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even when they are on the start , landing and rolling field , the faa declared .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that are used for the use of wi-fi in larger heights are now available in the us .
laura glading , president of the professional cabin professional , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” said glading .
we are frankly tired of being like a little more passive on this issue .
however , internet connections for surfing , e-mails , text messages or downloading data were kept below three kilometres , explained the reason why the agency was not allowed to do so .
passengers are asked to purchase smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .
so still no words with friends , which scrabbble resembles online game , which the look of actor alec baldwin 2011 is on his smartphone , as he was publicity effective .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin .
mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , not with the fa .
faa may lift a ban on certain electronic devices when they start and landing on the market .
last month mark rosenker of the national transportation safety authority said : &quot; safety board , safety experts for national transport issues on cbs news , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they potentially cause disturbances in navigation devices , but because we are aware of the fcc that the transmission from the air also transmitting poles can disturb ” , says .
a consulting committee of the industry , which is appointed by the faa to examine this issue , recommended that the commission should examine the issue last month .
in recent years , pressure on the faa has increased , restrictions on use have been relaxed .
critics like the democratic senator claire mccaskill of missouri argue that there is no valid european security policy .
the restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent .
some studies have said that up to one third of passengers are prevented from switching off the unit or are ignored .
the faa began in 1966 to ban the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disturbances in navigation and communication equipment were published by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and built in the way approved by the faa to be offered electronic interference .
airlines have been offering passengers wi-fi internet access for several years now , when the flight is reached .
the software adapted to wi-fi systems is designed to be insensitive to the interference of the aircraft .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be used for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-reader , for example , only give off minimal radiation when you scroll around .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transfer values are stronger .
those who advocate easing restrictions on equipment use are also advocates of the amazon.com.
in 2011 , corporate employees were lucky to have a passenger aircraft full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect any problems .
members of the faa advisory committee expressed mixed feelings , which is a risk to the use of equipment .
douglas kidd of the passenger association national association of airline passengers said that he was of the opinion that the disruption caused by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other committee members said that there was only a few reports from pilots who had been forced to disrupt aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recommended that the faa should not allow pilots to be intercepted by the police in poor visibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers who are now heavily involved in technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air rescue service from north sea bohrisland geretteter vogel released again .
a medical centre can be reached by air rescue service , which can be exhausted on a north sea borehole .
the water purple was fitted with a helicopter to aberdeen last month , where it was taken from the scottish animal welfare organisation spca in their rescue centre in alloa .
colin seddon , head of the center , said , “ this purple was probably a winter zugsphogel from northern europe , which was destroyed by the strong winds over the north sea . ”
apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .
he added : “ he could not continue flying , so we were not happy with the request for help . ”
when they were released , the water purity was fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite ready to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what the people who are in britain are doing for prosperity and work .
to this end , we have prepared the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy , and the eu .
yougov asked about 1,000 executives from the economy who were roughly the uk ’ s corporate size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside europe and concentrated on countries that need to modernise and grow while the states in the eu are stagnating .
they want a new trade connection to be established by government agencies with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than dealing with the long and exhausting process that has been obscure eu institutions .
asked for your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control of these key competences should be transferred to westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the brussels rules now outweigh the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of the big companies agreed .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing to say , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority wanted britain to change course towards the agreement and to establish a relationship with the eu based on trade , not politics .
this recognition , which has proved to be a common occurrence among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pressing for “ meaningful change ” that brings the stitching of action back to britain .
there is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change in opinion in favour of staying in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lagging behind its plan for the renegotiation of the british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are moving from renegotiation to a significant shift in power relations back to britain .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone has recovered toward a closer economic and monetary union .
priority must be given to jobs and growth in the united kingdom , as the result of our survey shows what a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulation means for businesses .
alexei miller of gazprom calls the pipeline in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south stream pipeline in bulgaria is starting with one of the largest european energy projects , the gazprom forecast board declared .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in europe , has begun , ” said the ceo of gazprom .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used to promote greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contract dispute between gazprom and his counterparts in ukraine , where the majority of russian gas is produced for europe , is worrying about a greater risk of gas shortages in conventional routes , as was pointed out by official sources .
miller said the direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the countries linked to transit countries will be “ open for ever ” .
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream at discounted rates if the entire project is put into operation in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction work in other secondary countries is to be carried out on the planned route by the end of the year .
the pipeline is scheduled for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca staff before allegations against jonathan lord for sexual harassment .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are in prison for sexual offences against children .
but the opening declaration before the commission , the ymca said that it was ‘ never able to speak with an incident of sexual kindness in the organisation ’ .
phillip hare , managing director , was asked about a case in which a ymca employee was charged with child pornography for offences , and another one in which a sports teacher was a ymca teacher .
hare said gail furness , one of the assisting lawyers in the commission , that he knew of the first case , but that he did not know the second .
he admitted that the opening declaration of the ymca to the commission was also inaccurate in claiming that ‘ there were external inspections of the ymca , in which the ymca was considered to be the forefront of child security ’ .
evidence before the commission shows , rather , that the ymca has been informed that it is the second-lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communication .
hare , who was born at the ymca with 21 , admitted that the management had “ been downward from me ” in the setting of lord and not ensured that he was a member of staff who knew about their obligations .
lord was arrested at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years of work for the ymca .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare , however , disagreed that the ymca had a cultural problem that prevented employees from becoming lords ’ offences in respect of the safety of children .
the staff said they had observed violations , including that lord alone had children .
danielle ockwell , whose chief lord was lord and who asked for a training on child protection because she was not a child because of his behaviour , said that she was not a child service director .
the managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to give their superior notification .
instead , he said , he was more keen to show his friendship with lord to the lord , which is why they had not reported him .
hare explained that he has been a member of the board of ymca nsw that the lesson the organization has learned from the “ jonathan lord interim incident ” is not a good one .
hare said that the decision to ask employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations have been made was taken by the managing director of the ymca children ’ s services , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence , but that is ‘ overzealous ’ and badly implemented .
the ymca nsw was in the time when jonathan lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , not safe organization for children , professor kevin stephen smallbone of the griffith university .
he explained that there are “ serious problems ” in recruiting , checking , enrolment , training , and supervision of employees .
the hearing was postponed until 20 december .
tony blair said that he would miss the chance to return as british prime minister – admittedly , a comeback is unlikely .
in an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the president of the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade of leader , blair has largely avoided committing himself to british politics , and his comments have mostly been directed toward foreign policy and his role as envoy to the quartet .
when asked if he would like to enter the post of prime minister , blair was elected by the evening standard of london , saying that he was “ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that he will . ”
when horse-shoe experts in the field of cardiff found themselves in the field of shortening the horse of the year , they knew that a fierce competition was about to take place .
but no one was able to count on the three year-old fenton kirkland .
the knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago has made its first steps , and its shetland pony toffee loosely tracked through the three rounds and picked up the first .
the unbroken couple , both equal size , were named after the one who was the first to perform their duties and style in the annual competition that was held by sunnybank equestrian centre in rudry .
in his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had his diaphragm cap set in a cheeky angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .
fenton was nominated by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which is far above his age .
and toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality .
fenton had toffee last march as a gift to his third birthday and since then he has been working with the shetland pony every day .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great deal of tension . ”
they had to take action against the entire participant field and are equipped with goldpokal and rosette .
it was only the second time that he was competing with toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .
completely strangers in the arena thought him to be so phenomenal that they could be photographed with him .
the small boy from the village of nantyglo near ebbw vale , south wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt sharon howell , who has been riding horses for more than ten years .
howell ’ s story : “ the whole audience was like electrified , and everyone fired it and clapped it . ”

chinese newspaper calls for “ reform ”
a chinese newspaper that is on the front page asking for the release of a reporter who was arrested for defamation .
the guangzhou based new express had a strange feeling of public .
but chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to report a substate company .
now the new express will be subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” explained the regulator .
the rectification order was carried out by the press and publications authority , radio , film and television in guangdong .
preliminary investigations showed that the new exchange rate , which is to be used for the yangcheng evening news group , was between september 2012 and august 2013 several inaccurate reports of the stock exchange nominated company zoomlioed zoomlikon .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disordered , ” said the regulator in a statement .
she said that she decided to impose “ administrative punishment for chen yongzhou and to give him his reporter license . ”
in addition , “ the yangcheng evening news group was instructed to provide a complete rectification of the new express and recommended that the relevant persons responsible for the new express be identified and immediately appointed the new express management team .
chen had published several articles for the new express , in which he talked about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomlion .
after he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and asked himself to be supported by his journalistic work .
but then chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports on pay .
“ in this case , i have damaged zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to restore public confidence , ” he said to the state news agency .
i have done so primarily because i have to rely on money and glory .
i have become aware that i have acted wrongly .
following chen ’ s apology , the new express issued an apology on the front page , explaining that it failed to address the reports correctly .
various well-known suspects have recently been on television saying that they are not .
experts say that confessions are still routine forced .
the tunnel of drock , with its own railway , which runs between the usa and mexico , has been discovered by the united states and mexico .
one of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely covered with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages that they have ever found .
the tunnel which is in the zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields links warehouses near the tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
there are countless unseen storage halls in the area , making it easier to find lorries carrying drugs .
the tunnel had been closed before drugs were transported undetected in it , the authorities declared .
the discovery of the tunnel has seen eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine , so the records of the court have been established .
three men , who were working as drivers according to the authorities , were sentenced to death for possessing and selling marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with prison sentences in a sentence of ten years and lifelong .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers are relying on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marijuana harvest in central mexico in october , which protected drug cartels against the challenge of quickly transporting their product to the consumer .
in 2010 , authorities found a passage of just 640 metres with rails , which was taken from a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two warehouses in san diego .

according to the lexica , veganism is subordinated to vegetarianism , but it is very different from that .
for while vegetarians are eating sahnettorte , ice or a strong eclectic , they are not at all bad .
milk , cheese , egg , besides the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan is completely excluded from the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .
what remains may be asked , but when we look at it , vegan food is characterised by a considerable decline in income .
&quot; bread spreads are very popular &quot; , explains ute henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who has a variety of special products for vegan .
reuben proctor also visits the shop at the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native new zealand has lived vegan , in lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live &quot; . in 1997 , i changed my diet and became a vegetarian .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the choice of shoe &quot; , says proctor , who prefers artificial leather to normal leather .
he recognized that there were also problems in other everyday matters without animal products .
vegan is primarily an ethic .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans who focus on the whole consumption behavior .
instead of burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , we have a lot of experience in the vegans , who are very enthusiastic about the products .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; proctor says today , &quot; in fact , vegan does not renounce it , not ascese , but it &apos;s an enrichment &quot; .
and it was precisely these conditions that made it possible for some , even so well-intentioned , to fail .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that allows many to quickly give up , similar to smoking , &quot; proctor makes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tastes are not to be fixed to the animal &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that taste .
&quot; but you can also create the same effect in other ways , &quot; the vegan illustrates .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few steps from the beach and the beach .
it takes care of a balanced , varied diet , in which it is also defective to taste .
of course , you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not only for animal food to be reduced , &quot; says proctor .
health damage , food disorders , another widespread assumption , has not suffered .
for me , the changeover had a positive aspect .
i don &apos;t take a foreign cholesterol and i have an increased proportion of vitamins .
there are high-performance satellites that only feed vegan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check me &quot; , he reveals .
especially in the absence of vitamin b12 , many vegansists warn .
&quot; since animals are fed with feed instead of being fed on the pasture , it is doubtful whether there is a risk of animal feed in the meat that is bought in the chill chest .
vegans also have the option of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proctor must be able to go a long way to get food .
after all , basic foods are everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .
all i need is to find on the spot .
only occasionally i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it is with &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products , as we know .
the preparation of vegan dishes is already much cheaper and less time-consuming , as is commonly assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small crackles you can enjoy good , if not partially better results , &quot; says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheesecake , proctor could also astound his parents-in-law .
the vegan festival is a new way of celebrating the family .
this is dynamic when you cook together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he has already been sceptical .
do not taste my food anymore ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - for such a question , i have to ask vegan with fingertip .
&quot; i do not disagree with people , i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want an enclavendaism .
and , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not appear as outsiders as it is thought - and vegans are not as restricted in everyday life as they usually assume .
fast food is also permitted .
pommes is everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , &quot; says proctor .
in a pizzeria , it is made up of pasta dishes , or it is possible to order a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .
the restaurants are so slowly getting started .
&quot; when i started to vegan 13 years ago , i was still far more difficult to feed myself , &quot; the new zealand can find a development : &quot; one must be familiar with the people , they must be alert . &quot;
&quot; if there are enough requests , you may be inclined to change the menu , &quot; hopes he .
vegan restaurants are developing , such as the mannheim combuesse or the café vogelfrei .
proctor wishes that other restaurants can also offer vegan food on the menu .
vegan dishes are basically there for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , truthfully in the sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor notes .
&quot; if we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to save the vast majority of the food scandals from the outset , &quot; says proctor .
the purchase of vegan products , however , could be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially when you learn to understand that also in peanuts animal additives as colorers can contain his , you seem to be satisfied with the adherence to ethics at so many hurdles and quickly fall out of courage .
not only for this reason , reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients that make up food but also cleaning products .
&quot; one gradually develops a scanner look and knows which characters and logos you have to pay attention to &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay stuck or stumble &quot; , says proctor .
veganism , it is an important moral pointer , which points to consciousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to leave his habits off , but at least he can teach consumers to critically follow his habits .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s bubble
the treasury has provisionally enforced the cgt measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of treasury chancellor george osborne , who will be the first to adopt a stamp tax of eur 20 million in the 2012 budget .
already , income from stamp taxes on housing in the districts of west minster and kensington &amp; chelsea is exceeding the tax year 2012 / 13 for 708 million pounds .
cook said , “ after the socks tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circumstance , it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are too low to be taxed , regardless of the impact .
“ but this move could be more restrained by foreign investors in buying property in london , or by preventing owners from selling , ” he added .
first class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the post-price housing market – in the wealthy london southwest belt , which is located between fulham and wimbledon , has been looking for redemption .
prices in central london were a constant annual growth of 5.6 % , but were reduced by a rising average “ infant market ” .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which the swing of a dog with its mood is associated .
previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were more right wedelte ( from the point of view of the dog ) while at nervous breeds there are the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs do not perceive and react to these subtle differences .
professor georgio vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the university of trento , said : “ people know well that the left and right half of the brain are reacting differently to stimuli that are positive or negative .
we have tried to do this with other species .
he also noted that dogs , like humans , have the right half of the brain for the left movement .
to learn more about how dogs are placed on the side of their species , please read the following pages .
they measured the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the tail is in one place , sometimes in the other direction .
professor vallortigara said , “ we have given the dogs movies with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette that can be distracted by other aspects .
when the animals saw an otherwise unexpressive dog sucking the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the wearing dog ) , they were able to see the whole world relaxed .
but was the tendency mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , which wedelt ) , so their heart rate rose and they saw uncallely .
professor vallortigara believes that dogs do not communicate intentionally through these movements .
it is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they were supposed to worry about and when not .
he said , ‘ if you want to have different encounters with other dogs and to have a wearing of the tail in one direction is more connected with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour , then you react to the basis .
researchers say that the findings of dog owners , animal doctors , and trainers have resulted in a better understanding of the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and guest scholarship at the faculty of animal medicine of the university of bristol explained that this was not the first study to study .
last year , a team of the university of lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they hit an aggressive dog , and right when they are a random dog .
in another research work at victoria university in canada , the following was stated : “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if his tail is left wedelt and not right , rather than restless .
according to him , the differences could result in the fact that the dogs in the various studies have been able to see the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .
a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says brad hay .
but as their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail is sometimes in one , sometimes in the other direction .

pope francis appoints his first cardinal in february .
pope francis will be presenting new cardinals of the catholic church for the first time on february 22 , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are also the ones who have a pope who choose a pope so that francis can become the first group of men .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in pope elections – that is to say , a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”
in a statement in which the news was announced , father federico lombardi , a spokesman of the vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held .
&quot; pope francis decided to withdraw his decision to convene the consistency story in february in advance .
jack valero by catholic voices said that the number of eligible polling clubs has risen by february .
he said that a pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary to keep the number of eligible cardinals afloat to 120 , and so many cardinals above 80 , as he would like .
the consistency of next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of francis in march of this year , so valero says .
there is currently a certain overhang on the part of europe , and particularly italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope cardinal from the rest of the world will appoint to restore balance , ” he said .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals will also be the first to have been created since the formation of the council of the cardinals established by franziscus , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world , who have the task .
in the past , the pope decided everything on its own .
“ now francis has left these eight cardinals to help him , ” said valero .
he said that it was “ possible ” that francis would have left the cardinals for advice .
but we have not been in this position so far – all new .
valero said that typically the bishops from large places to cardinals would be called , but stecke francis “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he will appoint . ”
gm calls new pickup trucks in the us to repair the seat backrest .
general motors calls for nearly 19,000 of his brand new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickup trucks with year 2014 to solve a problem with the manually adjustable leg seat .
some cars may have a defect in the mechanism for reset the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety on head restraints .
“ when the vehicle is driven from behind , it is possible that the head restraint can not properly protect the occupants , so that an increased risk of injury exists , ” said the news on the national highways website .
the returned models were tested between 1 august and 10 september .
the delivery of the gm trucks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading american car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed vehicle owners in the first half of october about the defect .
the nhtsa was unable to reach a decision because of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in october .
the sale of silverado and sierra trucks , which will be redesigned for the 2014 model year , was completed by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year , gm explained on friday .
in october , gm sold 42.660 silverado and 16.503 sierra pickup trucks .
the gm share rose to € 1.4 per cent to € 37.47 per share on friday afternoon .
an obama electorate ’ s desperate cry
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change is possible .
he says that obama has made laudable efforts to remedy the deadlock in republicans .
the policy of blockade does not excuse the site problems of obamacare , the drone attacks on the web site , the drone attacks on the internet , the drone attacks on the internet .
obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign were a sad reminder of what could have been done .
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical school .
i am currently reading a terribly sad book .
it is a book of which i believed it would make me feel at home during the twilight second year of my medical studies and tell me again that i am hopeful .
the audacity to win ( courage to win ) and signs the story of the memoirs barack obamas for the presidential election of 2008 .
when i go to the hospital in the evening and go to bed , i am taken back to a time when the politics of life inspired millions and gave the apostle a breath of fresh air .
the election was a landslide victory and news spokesmen held in order to demonstrate the historic importance of this hour .
my classmates wept before joy , and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama came into office in 2008 , he had agreed to 82 % .
and then i close the book .
reswitching to the present is a bad awakening , as if you were torn out of a dream .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed people ’ s opportunities .
in the years since i first voted , the situation has indeed changed .
but it is simply not something i could have imagined .
i recognise the great and varied things that obama has achieved , from adopting a treaty of afforable care act. the eu is a member of the european parliament .
i agree that the party political blockade is too much of a desire to go to the wrong track .
but , having repeatedly criticised the obama administration for colleagues and acquaintances , i am not at all satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political despair .
republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to intercept the interception of foreign leaders or to prevent the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has obtained data on the private lives of americans and why whistleblower is being punished , which is a disclosure of misconduct by the state .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awlaki , an american citizen , was not murdered without trial , nor why public funding and public spending were restricted during the presidential election .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the nixon government . ”
and , most recently , it cannot excuse the inability to make progress in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether this is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood by 18 that the government work was inconsistent with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the office of deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events like the newtown massacre predetermine public debate .
but if i look at the examples mentioned above , they seem largely to be elected by the government itself .
and that is what is most disturbing to me .
i re-elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusiastic about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and unsophisticated alternative , seeming to be his direction and position .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free of the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard about for so long .
but , with the fall in the approval values for obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 through this book has become all the harder .
it arouses in me a longing for the many promises that have disappeared .
this week i read a section in the book describing how obama could make a severe loss against clinton in the pre-election campaign in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
five years later , mr. president , and i could not tell you more .
the comments expressed in this comment are exclusively those of nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has been a source of conflict of interest in parental leave and that he has been a source of conflict of interest in parental leave .
the billionaire and mr palmer are saying that prime minister tony abbott is in a conflict of interests in his parental leave plans because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining magnat , who was in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in co2 tax , claimed that the eu was not going to resolve issues that were not in the right direction .
the palmer united party could win up to four votes in the senate , which is important for deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be removed or reduced .
but palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of abbott would benefit personally from the laws .
&quot; it is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , &quot; said palmer .
two months after the election , the palmer electoral commission , with 53 votes , declared a leap forward officially following the recount as the winner of the sunshine coast seat of fairfax .
palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could go faster .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections were held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we are marching in , transferring data to a computer , immediately choosing and then at 6 : 30 in the evening having the result ?
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers .
if you use them because you can then erase the results if you do not like them ?
to be able to vote with pencil nowadays is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic election and has recently presented a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , declared that his policy was to establish an international airport for the sunshine coast and that he would resume his new office “ very seriously . ”
public office is about service to the public .
“ we are not seeking any reward except for that of history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two forex traders
the royal bank of scotland has two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people who have been involved in the situation , and this is another indication of how much the world government has been able to make of the alleged manipulation .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , confirmed that they had been in contact with the authorities in the investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where us $ 5.3 trillion is held every day .
the two traders would be the first rbs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal surrounding the libor interbank business brought about .
the bank , which has not commented on the suspension , confirmed this month that the bank will not accept requests for information from authorities .
“ our investigation into this subject goes on and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulatory agencies , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that the rbs had to keep the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the british regulatory authority , which is the financial consult .
this merchant , richard usher , had left rbs 2010 and is now to be replaced by his current position as european head of the forex spot trade at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading company citi , was left on holiday this week and matt gardiner , formerly the leading currency trader in barclays and ubs , was arrested this week .
none of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .
the instant message group of usher included bankers at barclays and the citigroup , said that close to the situation people .
ubs announced this week that they are taking steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authority declared finma that they had a suspected manipulation of the forex market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities worldwide – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us department of justice and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently engaged in accusations of bangladesh .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credit suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .
banks are trapping instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has brought traders into turmoil in an area that has led to one of the most profitable trading companies in the world in recent years .
some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to curb the vast and highly liquid market of foreign exchange .
a leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing demand for own investments has not been fully addressed by banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit suisse announced that she had been giving a trader of her london exchange traded funds office this week after he had been in a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year .
the bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” credit suisse said .
the fence of the building on the bechtelle site is painted in a wooden frame .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; schweizer wiese &quot; has opened the fence on the bechlle land on the kurpromenade in bad herrenalb .
moreover , it cleaned and widened the footpath , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the declining house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is in danger of slipping .
alfred abel , who currently manages the property , had announced the beautification action with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the bi ’ s action , a transparent one was called for with the message , &apos; we are in favour &apos; .
this disturbed the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative , however , little in their action .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; we are against ruins of buildings &quot; .
in doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the swiss meadow - if the giant project one day fails .
in conversation with many passers-by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented .
but they are beginning to resign because the city is still dragging its feet on these responses , it is said by the bi .
as has been said , public statements by the mayor are also acting .
in may , the local council said that it would abolish the thermal bath .
some seem to be frightened by this , while others see it as &apos; crude blackmail &apos; at the population , as they say in the press release of the bi .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .
ranking rods for schiris : mane no swallow king , no swallow king , no man of swallows .
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high shape of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg is , however disappointed the team was not able to find the sports director of the &quot; bulls &quot; .
&quot; there is a dangerous tendency at the moment that mane and alan are being placed in the category of swallow kings , &quot; he took the two offensive whirlers at a press conference in salzburg on thursday .
the most recent reason for ranking nicks was yellow for mane at the 3 : 0 against grödig last sunday , where the senegalese were given a supposed acting act - the free .
&quot; a blatant misdecision , &quot; rangnick said , referee harkam was &quot; overburdened &quot; .
harkam would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the escalation between salzburg-coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
he defended his fellow german citizen decidedly : &quot; i would have behaved like roger schmidt in every situation . &quot;
schmidt himself wants to look for the scharmützel with hütter without having had contact with his colleague .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who was insulted , &quot; the 46-year-old stressed .
in view of the success of the event , ranking was a tribute to the city .
&quot; there are only two words for this : right good , &quot; he noted .
there is not much to be said about .
in particular , the way the team plays is impressive .
let us continue with this .
changes in the skill during the winter transfer period will hardly be there .
there are no great reasons for changing anything .
&quot; except for one player , he wants to leave the club , &quot; ranked the first player .
supreme court confirms obama ’ s health act
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court decided today that the narrow relationship with barack obama was a major victory .
by five to four votes , judges judged that the patient protection and afforestation mandate was not sufficient .
chief judge john roberts suggested that he should be on the side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while judges scalia , thomas , alito , and kennedy chose against .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of law and also held the view that the provision of the health act , according to which states may either meet the conditions for access to medicaid or otherwise terminate all state institutions .
the legal action was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent states .
the law was signed by all the leading republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger mitt romney , in the run-up to 2012 .
norway : norway &apos;s place is filled with huge mirrors of light .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have shed light on their dust valley .
due to the low solar rainfall , the water in the vestfjord valley is falling from autumn to spring , usually in the shadow of the surrounding mountains .
with three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters height , a century-long space was realized on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , mayor steinar bergland swarmed up at the start ceremony at tv2 .
some of the valley inhabitants were right to use sunchairs , others used sunglasses for safety purposes .
so far , sun-hungry people have had to go to a nearby summit by cable car in winter .
ten years ago , local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to transfer the rays with mirrors to the valley .
this idea has been in place since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million crowns ( about 615 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction has given the italian alpine village viganella a wintry sunshine for some years .
post is empty hardly on sundays
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed the red dots for sunday evenings .
i have confirmed this in a request from the fdp .
on sundays and holidays , only before the post office building in the ernst-ludwig-straße 36 and in the jakob müller-straße 1 in hüttenfeld will be empty .
whether in hofheim and rosengarten , even on sunday , the answer to the fdp ’ s question will not answer .
the social and youth policy spokesman of the fdp , fritz roehrenbeck , wants to make up for this .
sunday emptying is an important postal service , especially at terminpost .
&quot; this enterprise smears down despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 radically and unreasonably &quot; .
thomas bittner , the association chairman of the liberal groups and the city councillors , supports his group colleague : &apos; what annoys me is the fact that this is a clamour to change or also to delete the rest &apos; .
the post office is a mile away from the city .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of neuchâtel and rosengarten must be emptied again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and rohrenbeck unisono .
the city is also known for its poor population , especially for non-mobile citizens , and it is also necessary to be able to reach a post box with sunday emptying .
roehrenbeck asked in the municipal parliament whether the city administration planned to hold discussions with the post about this matter .
mayor erich maier replied that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .
he knows , however , that there is also a sunday empty in hofheim .
your party has , of course , declared itself in favour of privatisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; maier said .
frankfurt parking charges are to rise sharply .
parking in frankfurt could soon become more expensive .
the magistrate of the city this morning discusses a submission of traffic devotees stefan majer ( green ) .
the parking charges are therefore to be increased by 50 percent .
but the price should not be raised , but the time interval of parking and parking tickets should be increased from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .
in december , the assembly of the city council must decide .
the retail committee of the ihk frankfurt considers that &apos; a bad idea &apos; .
the hotel is very clean and the staff is very helpful .
germany , with its transport club , believes that an increase after two decades &apos; is &apos; perfectly reasonable and actually long overdue &apos; .
public transport will also be more expensive .
freudenstadt : fast actions overrun hosts
with a narrow cadre , the tsv freudenstadt lords had to be moved to reutlingen against the tg gönningen tg from the schwäbischen alb .
the elders were confronted with an experienced team on the other side of the net .
soon , however , it became apparent that , even in the age of the year , they could not quite keep up with the rapid actions of the freudenstädter .
with the hard and placed surcharges , the patron sam gönningen did extremely hard .
they repeatedly missed the opportunity offered by simon schenk and eduard schulz to clean the network center and attack and were at the blockdefence stage .
two high first prizes were clearly expressed by the superiority of the freudenstadt in all matters .
in the face of this crushing and gambling performance , the third sentence was then somewhat lax and loud at the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
this will be on november 2 with the tv baiersbronn , which was able to clearly assert itself in nagold , a much more powerful opponent in the field .
tsv freudenstadt i : dominik bäuerle , yannik büchle , sebastian dölker , felix pälchen , stefan räller , simon schenk and eduard schulard schulz .
the b-class was the seat of the murgtalhalle in baiersbronn , where the second teams from baiersbronn and freudenstadt stood opposite .
they delivered a highly contested two-hour match .
nervousness on both sides caused a stir , especially during the ball acceptance , and scores , and there was also a lack of precision in passports and in some critical game scenes .
in this highly balanced meeting , the tv-team of marcus blazutto agreed , however , that the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams were all in place .
a day of care for the little english cottage
the fifth nursing day in the aftermath of the natura 2000 project of obere hotzenwald was attended by a group of committed participants at the small english hut in ibach .
based on popular suggestions , the day should be a day in the area of the hut to view the valley , mayor helmut kaiser said .
many hikers called , according to kaiser , this area as the glossy piece of the gorge on which the landscape is the ideal setting for wonderful views .
he thanked the people present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument for establishing the link between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to be able to set their own priorities in nature .
at the same time , the tourism aspect could also be taken into account in the environmental field .
friedrich schreike , who was the head of the department of nature conservation , explained this ecological aspect following the welcome initiative of the landrat tilman bollacher , who was the patron .
the tourist destination of the vistview is according to tribukait with the aim of preserving the already heavily grown old allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing ones .
certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass butterflies , may not overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free connections to keep your species .
tribukait said she wanted to keep it at this point , a lance to break for the planned biosphere reserve .
the current measure does not only seamlessly fit into this planning .
a biosphere area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised unesco world heritage status and thus a continuous addition to the world heritage list associated with the life project and the previous foster days .
after these different versions , the tour guide christoph wehle and life project manager cornelia bischoff shared the helpers in groups .
the larger trees were beaten in advance , the forest tractor may be available for retrieval .
a group of helpers should try to exempt juniper bushes and care for a dry stone bar .
the aim was to open the view at the viewpoint .
spotting : heads still only stand in the candidate .
information on the internet : although the baar town of löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children &apos;s , youth and senior citizens &apos; policy , as well as its own urban agenda .
as the only candidate to succeed the age limit that is no longer being applied for , norbert brugger has been the 46-year-old banking officer and business manager dieter köpfler from löffingen .

google , samsung , huawei because of nortel patents are sued by nortel patents .
the group , which has thousands of previous nortel patents , imposed a lavish of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , which is the company that was involved in insolvency .
rockstar , the consortium that holds the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , is complaining about the lack of a samsung electronics co ltd , htc corp , huawei and four other companies .
rockstar is a joint ownership of apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google will be accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents cover technology , the search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , and the results are published by the court of justice .
samsung ’ s representatives , huawei , htc , and rockstar were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc make mobile phones that are compatible with google ’ s android operating system , which is in sharp competition with mobile products from apple and microsoft .
in 2011 , google gave an initial bid of $ 900 million to the nortel patents .
google increased its offer several times and offered a last 4.4 billion dollars .
after the nortel patents of rockstar overbowed , the google engine acquired mobility , which was sold to the u.s. for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly funded by motorola ’ s library .
“ although google has failed in its attempt to ban the patent for action at the auction , google has not infringed the patents and continues to do so , ” says the complaint .
rockstar claims a high amount of google damages because it claims google &apos;s patent infringement is deliberate , so the accusation .
egypt sworn in first freely-elected president
mohammed morsi disloses the oath of office , but his day of triumph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islamist mohammed morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn in , and thus the successor of husni mubarak , who had been 16 months away .
with his inauguration to the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth leader since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 dressed in black robes judges of the court , which is located at the nile and is an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy and stability , ” said morsi , a 60-year-old american educated engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when morsi was briefly attacked by the police shortly after 11 o &apos;clock local time .
only a few hundred supporters had gathered in the court to meet the new president , and , unlike the presidential prussian feud , the mubarak war has only been allowed to stop the traffic for a short time , so that the car can be stopped .
as a non-charismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the brotherhood , his personal prestige has been mocked since his victory and a friday speech , in which he was not only a candidate for the islamists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue suit with red kraft .
later morsi went to the university of cairo , where he was supposed to deliver his inaugural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band that had founded the national anthem , who he had been listening to .
the military leader , feldmarshal hussein tantawi , was present .
on his arrival , he was heard by hundreds of people in the university &apos;s largest auditorium , with chorus of “ the army and the people are one hand . ”
the bastion was founded in 1908 as a secular education university of cairo , and has developed into a leading university in the 1970 ’ s .
morsi put a symbolic oath on tahir-square on friday , the birthplace of the uprising , which ended last year ’ s end of mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he praised power .
but , with the official oath taken to court , and not as usual before parliament , he bows to the will of the military , indicating that the struggle for power will continue .
morsi ’ s speech on tahir square was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger discothek provides two great evenings of dancing and dancing .
the new season in the falkenberger disco &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .
today , friday evening , the name of the &apos; pump this party &apos; is on the agenda , and tomorrow , saturday evening , we will have a ü 25 party .
fat beats and cool sounds are naturally being played by the organisers on both days .
workers crashed by leaders : seriously injured
when replacing a defective external sensor , a 51-year-old worker crashed in eggelsberg on thursday , and was seriously injured .
the man from lamprechthausen wanted to create a defective heating sensing on the outside façade of an inn .
when he came to the dachtrinne , he slipped down and the man fell .
he suffered serious injuries and was injured with the &quot; christophorus 6 &quot; rescue helicopter to the landeskrankenhaus salzburg .
rapes in south africa : two times a lifetime of life
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in south africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to two lifelong sentences on friday .
this was reported by the station sabc .
the victim was later struck by the consequences of serious injuries .
johannes kana was already in the early days of the crime .
the deeds had caused horror nationwide .
the then 21 year old had anene booysen in february in an industrial area in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours the doctors fought for the survival of the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the young people was so horrifying that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .
kana had admitted during the trial , during tatnight with booysen in a bar .
he also admitted that they had beaten and raped them , but he denied that they were responsible for the death of the girl .
the police were initially run by several perpetrators , but dismissed two suspects because the occupants had been unable to provide evidence .
the prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that it was convinced that kana was not ready at the time of the attack .
rape has been a part of everyday life in south africa : there are around 64 000 indications of sexual violence every year .
that is almost ten times the amount in germany , but it is far more populated than south africa ( 50 million ) , with 82 million people .
police and women ’ s organisations in south africa estimate the dark figure in sexual violence , but it is 10-25 times that .
jumbo visits the black forest ham ham and the black forest ham .
jumbo looking for the &quot; best ham in the world &quot; : for the tv program &quot; galileo &quot; visited the tv show pro7-star bonndorf .
the speaker makes it clear at the outset : the most important thing for the ham is the pig culls , turbomast is not a good prerequisite .
can ham that you can get in any supermarket , that is , a quality product ?
uli , the head of the large schinkenfabrik in the black forest , explains jumbo the way the company &quot; adler &quot; operates in bonndorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jumbo shinks announced to the black forest ham .
only with hair protection and kittel will it enter the interior of the factory .
jumbo must also shut his hands first before he is sent to the micro .
jumbo to strengthen the muscles in waldshut .
&quot; here i am working hard , &quot; amazed by the tv makers , black forest ham as a mass product .
16,000 keues per week speak for themselves .
weight , fat content , color : uli explains what it is all about in terms of quality .
most pigs are slaughtered with six months .
television with standards ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i am curious if your roberto blanco measures what happens &quot; , so jumbo zynisch .
this is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching it is still worth it .
the spectator sees that the dismantling of the culls continues to be handcrafted .
because : black forest ham is traditionally without bones on the shelf .
the secret of the ham is the spice mixture with salt .
the smoke tower and the smoke humidity reminds jumbo optically of a &quot; submarine &quot; .
the trick : pine branches make the smoke special for the black forest ham .
20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black .
&quot; now the disk disappears in jumbo , &quot; he announces the test feeding .
&quot; this is really delicious &quot; , says the conclusion of the tv star .
that will enable everyone involved to live with it .
they thought that travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resisting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now starting a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared to 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are met , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to record earnings of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011 / 12 .
as managing director graham turner announced , flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit and recorded a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in the australian and british private sector .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are heading in the right direction for record year earnings before interest and taxes , ” he said .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strongest earnings providers .
in australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , which resulted in a slightly weaker market for business trips .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes walk from the main train station and the main shopping area .
the us business recovered from the weaker seasonal first half of the year , so that a profit for the total year was expected for the third consecutive year .
the shares of flight centre increased yesterday by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .
schools are becoming more focused on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .
in courses on english literature , students must in future study at least one piece of shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyrics and contemporary british novels from 1914 .
the test also includes “ unseen texts ” to gain wider reading .
the combined english literature and language course will be abolished .
from 2015 , students must carry out an independent gcse language test , with strong incentives to study english literature as separate quality qualifications .
the ministry of education will tomorrow present the new english and mathematics curricula – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned .
other core subjects will be changed next year .
a separate initiative calls for the establishment of ofquaal , the supervisory authority for audits , of a reorganization of the gcse structures , including a new bending system and less pricing work .
in a speech in the summer , education minister michael gove said that there is “ broad consensus that we need to reform our auditing system in order to restore public confidence ” , emphasising that the gcses would “ challenge . ”
studies show that in english schools there is less time for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week a school year – than in most other countries .
in contrast , australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in singapore receive 138 hours .
although there will be no formal requirement to go on for math in the timetable , there is no need for a coalition to make a decision on the comprehensive math test , combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in the various countries .
the curriculum focuses more on “ real life problems ” , including financial mathematics .

salem : johanna rahner at the ecumenical forum of interviews in the ecumenical forum in vienna .
the next ecumenical forum on monday , 21 october , at the new museum of the castle , will deal with the topic &quot; to hell with hell - theological considerations on how to deal with the last things today &quot; .
lecturer is professor johanna rahner .
the ecumenical forum is an initiative of the catholic and protestant church communities salem , the salem castle and the kulturamtes bodensee county .
johanna rahner wants to look at the forum on how people can now understand the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had been able to learn too much about this over the past few centuries , and had put on those images of heaven and hell that shape our ideas to this day , the contemporary prophet doctrine of the world .
&quot; the greater hope is christian women through the religious critique .
she has told us &apos; so many question marks that the exclamation marks have turned us off &apos; .
johanna rahner goes on to say : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death &quot; .
this raises the question of the desire to &quot; dream of the world &apos;s end to be good &quot; .
johanna rahner , born in baden-baden in 1962 , studied catholicism and biology at albert-ludwigs-university freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .
she received her phd in 1997 , dr. theol , also in freiburg .
the habitation of fundamentaltheology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the westphalian wilhelms-university .
since 2010 johanna rahner has a chair for systematic theology at the institut für catholic theology of the university of kassel .

illmensee : the second mountain bike race attracts participants from all over the world .
in beautiful weather 214 cyclists came to illmensee to take the tour of the hill chains around the lake .
this is shared by ulrich knobel from the sports club illmensee .
among the participants were , especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , numerous people who were cycling their hobby once in betting positions .
two junior riders of the german top class were also on the start in this race : felix bader from bad waldsee and pascal treubel from aach-linz came with the recommendation to win good rankings .
these two were able to settle , as expected , from the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of short distance .
in second place , pascal treubel was again able to place himself .
the ladies had a lot of fun with the albdream team , which put it on the top of the winning stairs .
in second and third place , anne adel from illmensee and leonie drivers from owingen came .
one welcome development is the increasing number of drivers who are in the community or who work .
not only in terms of performance , but also in terms of performance , the range of athletes was represented .
the age structure was also sufficient for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters .
the main race was even more topathy at the start this year .
four drivers were able to get away from the top regional drivers .
among them philipp pangerl , a mountain bike semi-pro from the black tusk racing team .
pangerl was two times world champion in the 12-hour driving together with a team colleague .
this year he became european champion in this special discipline .
roland ballerstedt , who has already won two german championship titles in the duathlon , is also playing his own .
after 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a whirlpool finish was reached before the three-semester hall .
pangerl was the first to reach the finish line .
only a second behind this was the routine ballerstedt who won second place in the overall ranking .
at the same time , hermann and warthmann were the third of the overall ranking .
in the ladies &apos; race , christiane cohsmann was the fastest in the main race .
second place was placed in areane blersch , which was under pressure from natascha werner from stuttgart .
athletes and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organised process of the event .
on the way through mud , rivers and jungle for free medical care
dr. georges bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in cameroon and the surrounding areas .
bwelle and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients .
in the west african country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device .
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle saw his sick father again and again losing his consciousness and travelling to hospitals that were unable to provide the necessary resources to help him .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in a car accident near yaoundé , the capital city of cameroon .
he had only one broken arm , but then the first one was an inflammation , which was based on his brain .
“ there were no neurosurgeons in cameroon , ” says georges bwelle .
we should have brought him out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , bwelle spent years trying to transform his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to ensure treatment there , which she could offer .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bwelle .
you can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has changed little since bwell &apos;s father died in 2002 .
in cameroon there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states with a doctor is between 413 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his compatriots had to see bwelle decide to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free operations last year .
he became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which is transported to rural areas at weekends and where free medical care is offered .
since 2008 he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and are driving with the snooping medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help .
not always everything goes smoothly .
they have had to drive the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .
but when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a banquet , vocals and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebration and shaft – with its broad smile and its boundless energy – is happy to attend the happy celebration .
the next morning the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per trip ” , bwelle says .
they come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are sentenced to death for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local anaesthesia .
the operations are usually carried out in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the procedure , the patients are up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next one .
the lighting for the op and the disinfection equipment is controlled by the group generator and thus bwave and its voluntary disinfection unit work until early morning hours .
it is a strenuous effort , but the village musicians usually help to motivate the team .
&quot; they are drumming all night so that we remain awake and continue our work , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday , the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has launched 700 free surgeries last year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to people who are helped .
a man explained that the free operation of a breakdown he received would now allow him to return to work .
“ this changes my family ’ s future , ” he said .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle works at night in private clinics in yaounda .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activities , so bwelle ; the rest from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who died at drexel university in philadelphia medicine in the second year and volunteered in bwell ’ s group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nursing students such as o &apos;malley , who come from the usa and europe and support bwelle , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they never had at home .
“ we can be present at operations where we help to tap blood or to use the instruments for dr. bwelle , ” says o &apos;malley .
that would have been a never in america as a medical student in the second year .
students pay their trip to cameroon usually by themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation materials .
but once you are in yaoundé , bwelle will take care of the accommodation , transport and instruction .
&quot; he is without doubt a hero , &quot; says o &apos;malley .
he devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the cameroon people knows no bounds .
for bwelle , the almost permanent work is not a burden .
to make others a happier life and to fulfil a promise he made to his father is preparing him for great joy .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” says bwelle .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees what i do .
i do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .

excellent the fight managed by the team .
the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novelle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson cut to the body .
janson was a very old hare in his metier , the actress .
the old man santiago cannot be deluded to anything in fishing .
the two are simply great complements .
it is almost thought that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , the fisherman &apos;s boy talking about , can be seen .
when santiago is tired of life on the chair , it is not so for janson .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a role of character that janson excellently masters. the role of the old fishermen is to be found in the world of the fish .
hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who did not give up and who was ultimately defeated by his knowledge and his will to fight the fish .
janson is widely regarded as the singer on stage .
it manages to attract the attention of the audience .
his efforts to finally get the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue light .
director jens hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance , he puts the active scene in the light : the cabin of santiago , the bar of singer marie-luise gunst , the bar with her songs and her magnificent voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the area is about 120 metres long and underneath cologne is a roman wastewater channel .
the cathedral is not far away .
the two towers stand out in the sky about 157 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who visit the two filigree church towers , can imagine that it is also under the cathedral a lot to discover .
rainer schulze is an expert in the cologne underground world .
the meeting point for his guided tours is the service centre of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts quite unspectacular : &quot; we start in the underground car park &quot; , says schulze .
in the 1970s , the city fathers wanted to build a city that was accessible by car , and therefore remained only the standing of the remains of the old city wall .
most users of the multi-storey car park are therefore also hurried by the roman remains and are only leaving their cars .
but if you look more closely , the parkdeck d2 discovers a metal grid tribe that separates the archaeological site .
the ruins of hand-legged buildings are about five metres high .
&quot; they are remnants of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century to christ , &quot; schulze says .
before we go back to the daylight , schulze leaves the participants at the upper level a look at a dark 15 meter deep water chess .
this is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly seen .
the next stop of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants go down again into the depths .
we are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the predecessor of the ccaa .
what ccaa means , a visitor wants to know .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which in good german means &quot; city of roman law and town of agrippinenser , founded under emperor .
and the pretorium is the former staathalter palace , the center of power of the roman empire on the rhine .
from the foothills of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the roman sewage canal , which is preserved here at about 120 meters .
&quot; you can easily find a piece along the so-called cloaca maxima if you want , &quot; joins schulze the guests .
schulze still has a surprise .
after having collected the key at the cash desk , he will lead the group to a 16 meter deep , walkable shaft .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to think of groundwater , which is essential for ritual washings .
to this day , the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , has seen different water levels being readable through varying levels of the rhine .
mikwe is part of an archaeological area on the town hall square , for which construction work is due to start soon .
however , a few years will pass by before completion .
leg almost hacked : new version of rocker process
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu will be rerouted after more than four years .
a trial of attempted manslaughter , dangerous body injury and material damage against two thirty years has been filed before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the accused remained silent at the start .
they are supposed to have been active in the rock scene and at that time they were among the bandidos .
the prosecutor accuses you of having , in june 2009 , together with unknown accomplices in finowfurt , to have thrown three men in a car and beaten them .
all victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
victims are to become the competing group of hell ’ s angels .
one is to be a high-ranking member from berlin .
it would appear that a hunt of several cars was carried out prior to that .
the charge was that there were battles with the turks and a demonstration of power .
the two accused were in a first trial in early 2012 .
a court spokesman said at the time that it was impossible to prove that men were not involved in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice revoked the judgment after the public prosecutor &apos;s review and pointed it to the court for further negotiation .
one of the accused is currently imprisoned for another offence .
the first was the reconstructing of the processes in the tatnacht .
as a witness , the commissioner who was appointed at the time was invited .
the centre was the phone calls of the defendants and other people who had intercepted the police .
it is difficult that rockers almost always have to go to court to comply with a law that is worthy of them - and not statements .
this also applies to victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been unpacked .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( oder ) said on request that new traces have been found since the last trial .
eleven further negotiating days have been set for the process .
the disposable society does not think
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .
but in the trees of the people on the front-passenger and rear seat , hunger is noticeable .
of course , some cocktail or champagne may be responsible for this !
what is more obvious than to go to the next drive in order to get a little bit more fun ?
i admit that i am happy to be part of this when it comes to late night or early morning .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as well home and in bed !
but , on their way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable .
what is the reason for this ?
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the old town , just a few minutes walk from the main railway station .
&apos;why ? &apos; i wonder .
are people too doof to take the bags home with respect until the next trash bin ?
it is not just the case that the paper product is misappropriating the landscape .
the bags have already been used to cover transport facilities such as the central planks , thereby causing accidents .
what does this mean to the &quot; disposable society &quot; , but not after , probably she does not even know what that word actually means .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the main railway station and the city centre .
there would be a couple of bags more or less even nowhere - unlike the road where no one is on the leftovers of other rumsfelts .
i can see that the day is coming when the cities and communities are being left to fester - and the fast-food industry chains for their pants are being asked to pay .
obama ’ s retreat in health policy
after intense criticism , president obama yesterday made a backward move to his frequently repeated , unambiguous promise : “ if you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice , the republicans have sent the president a letter of warning in recent days that he has misled the american public .
yesterday , obama relatised his initial promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who want a functioning health insurance can keep it , ” he said at a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the announcements , obama called on those americans who received such communications to engage in free markets for a new insurance policy .
most citizens could thus have better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more cheaply than anticipated .
“ you get a better offer , ” he said .
the government has not been surprised to see that the five percent of the population that has insurance themselves are looking for a different rate .
“ i want to say to these americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” sebelius said at a hearing before the energy and trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the affordable care act , is not responsible for the launch of the online platform since october .
“ i am equally frustrated and angry as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this phrase of an excited sebelius to a consultant behind her sitting at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the representative &apos;s house was rejected after a dispute with the republican member , billy long .
after more than three hours of consultation , long sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question why the “ architect ” of the affirable care act was not released voluntarily .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air base not only on syria ’ s air base , but also on syria ’ s air base .
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous has made a statement to the american news channel , cnn , on thursday , that israeli fighter aircraft have a day before filed an air force base in syria ’ s lair .
the aim is &apos; missiles and related equipment &apos; , from which the israeli government feared that they would be responsible for the lebanese hezbollah , hezbollah said it was &apos; cnn &apos; .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab al-arabiya channel , had previously reported that the base in the port city of latakia was on thursday at night .
the israeli television channel channel 2 showed satellite pictures of the base in latakia , where russian abstention missiles were launched from the s-125 newa type and a battery of sa-3 missiles .
uncertain the government in jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency reuters quotes a similarly anonymous israeli government official , saying that he believes that israel is carrying out the attack , but that he is not sure .
a spokesman of the israeli ministry of defence said , &apos; we are not commenting on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai stressed in the daily yedioth ahronoth , that the syrian regime had already , in some cases , successfully tried to establish ground air missiles in the air .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by syria to stop hezbollah from using chemical or other dangerous weapons would be unacceptable .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented admission that the us economy is now undergoing “ undue ” and that the us espionage is “ going too far . ”
john kerry suggested with an unexpected admission that the us would weaken its defensive stance in relation to its surveillance challenges .
the foreign minister also admitted that he was wrong with barack obama to take responsibility for “ autopiot ” .
the leaked information has made the us government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .
a video conversation at the open government conference in london , kerry said : “ there is no question that the president and i , and others in the government , have learned of some of the things that are almost automatic pilots .
he was the first senior member of the us government to admit that the us spying was a border crossed , emphasizing that the us was not a right abused .
he said , ‘ in some cases this has gone too far inappropriately . ’
the president is determined to create clarity , and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be compromised in this process .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa was a force of good , and that its surveillance operations saved many lives .
he added : “ we are facing a new world in which people are ready to move themselves into the air . ”
there is radical extremism in the world that is anxious to kill people , in which the world is buried and governments are attacked .
so what if you were able to catch up and stop this , before it happened ?
we do indeed have aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have been very vigilant in the run-up to such plans .
meanwhile , us legislators will travel to europe to raise concerns about the alleged american espionage and to convince europeans of the need to stop the us anti-terrorist attacks .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said that he met with representatives of the european parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from the debate because of frustration .
“ it is very important for the national security interests of the us that europeans are more sensitive to the threat of terrorism than they are to our common efforts against terrorism , ” said murphy , who was first in the senate as a democrat .
i am also going to europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , irrespective of their anger over the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have improved relations with some us allies , although the us government director has not yet taken any notice of the reports being inaccurate .
other revelations quoted from snowden &apos;s handed documents that nsa would not use the phone of chancellor angela merkel and until the age of 34 other state leaders .
the head of the national intelligence services , james clapper , defended the spying of allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides .
in all the tumult , murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress ’ s trip , which is due to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .
the names of the other members present will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being prepared .
while murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there were some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments must be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs , thus better protecting europeans ’ rights , they must also address the fact that they are not the only ones to protect spirits . ”
meanwhile , john kerry is on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to get to grips with the resentment of the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

australian appeals for prison sentences in thailand .
a 21-year-old sydney woman who was 15 days in prison in phuket because she was wrongly claiming to be being tortured by a taxi driver .
stevie rochelle bamford was first tried by a provincial court in phuket on 15 june , a false statement was made .
later , however , the shots of a video camera showed that she had safely reached her hotel after being separated from her australian friend .
the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days until they knew that history had been thought out .
until the trial , it was in police custody on the ground .
bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a detention centre with a low security level on the outskirts of phuket , instead of being in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who has been appointed to the foreign ministry in canberra to help his daughter .
tunks explained to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family is “ extremely worried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in australia .
“ we are of course very concerned , but we hope that you will return home as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford appealed against the judgment and is liable for a deposit of 50.000 baht at free foot .
australian reports read that they have been in the meantime in the resort krabi in southern thailand .
the court of justice has said that bamford is being replaced by a local lawyer in phuket and is being warned that the appeal will also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in prison .
however , it is also possible that , following the recent assassination of michelle smith in phuket , thailand will be trying to stop its beleaguered tourist destination image .
