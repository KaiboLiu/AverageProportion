opinions on the subject : even more safety for pedestrians .
they are not 100 metres apart , and the next morning is the official opening of the new b 33-foot walk in the report .
two plants as close to each other : intention or turtle tortoise ?
this question has been examined by the mayor of the city yesterday .
&quot; the town hall museum is a unique place to visit , because it was the school path &quot; , explains the author of the book yesterday .
the club members &apos; lights safe both cycling and walking .
the commission &apos;s communication on the future of the european union , which was officially launched yesterday , is important for the sulzbachweg / kirchstraße crossing area .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area of › grub � .
&quot; the high traffic and traffic volume of the city is a result of the need for further traffic lights &quot; , says eckert .
this also confirms peter arnold from the regional council of offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 daily passes about 12 000 vehicles through the municipality of gutach , of which about 10 % are heavy goods traffic , &quot; emphasizes arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety simply goes ahead &quot; , arnold said .
overall , four traffic shows have been carried out , including a circular traffic , but due to the narrow in the area of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße again discarded .
it was named after arnold at the location of the traffic light masts .
the approximately 15 000 euros expensive amperes themselves are the &apos; most modern , most efficient &apos; system in the market at present .
the complex is equipped with coloured leds , which are so powerful that it is possible to see the lights from the car drivers , for example , even in the sunniest .
and economical , it is also : the older light installations use about 100 watts , which are new just eight watts .
the journey is about three light hours per direction .
arnold explained the technique of the new system : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
if the pedestrian is pushing the traffic light button , the upper traffic light tests the speed of traffic and determines the distance to the pedestrian area .
is the road free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian .
another raid-sensor checks whether the radar &apos;s green phase is suitable for pedestrians .
&quot; if a group or handicapped people should go across the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely across the road , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , the drivers must be seen as partners here and the track must be monitored .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly had the traffic light shown for pedestrians green , noise and a high class car .

the european union , which is embedded in cellophan or mieder , is stacking at dangerously high levels through the staging , either monologizing them loudly or lying completely silent on the stage .

american road plans
the devices that are used to detect each kilometre of danger and send information to the authorities are the core of a controversial experiment by washington and the plan committee .
the usually slower system of the road planning has suddenly become a more intense debate with colourful alliances .
libertarian parties have dealt with environmental groups and speak out in favour of the eu government taking the small boxes to the tune of the danger kilometres – and possibly also , where they are being driven .
the tea party is a horrible party .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned about the situation and is making a number of concerns about data protection .
but , while in congress , the focus is not on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
you are currently examining how you can make a contribution to a system over the next ten years , with drivers being able to earn a mileage per driver .
thousands of car drivers have taken the road recorders , from which some have been equipped with gps monitoring , and the number of them has been tested .
this is a must for our country .
“ it is nothing that we can only possibly use ” , said hazan ikhrama , managing director of soutthern cell technology .
the way in which the european union handles these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the high-way trust fund is being set up from the taxes .
but in america , no longer so much is being done .
cars consume less petrol .
the state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 euros ) is a major factor in the price of oil for 20 years .
politicians dare to make money from high prices , even if they are paying a penny .
“ the petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” says lee munnich , a expert in petrol legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently received 500 cars with driver &apos;s rights .
“ this is the most sensible solution in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it a metric by which they can earn a lot of money .
it is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is not always the same , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions can be reduced .
califorian planners rely on the system for the development of strategies to help the ambitious and the unpredictable goals of the state .
but the republican bill has been shouting for the us from pennsylvania , chairman of the house transport committee .
the free circulation of goods and services in the reach foundation is also dependent on the idea of driving drivers back to work .
“ this is not a tax that is applied in a black hole . ” he explains .
people are paying directly for what they do get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who have been in a report in 2011 to the congress .
the us senate approved the draft resolution last year , which is $ 90 million expensive pilot project , covering 10,000 cars .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the incident from happening and responded to the concerns of many members of parliament from rural areas who represent people who are in their everyday lives often miles on the road to work or in the city .
several states and large cities are moving in a similar direction .
the most dedicated part of the project is oregon , which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .
these drivers will soon be taking the mileage charges instead of the tax on petroleum to the state .
nevada has already developed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a scheme .
illinois tests it in limited quantities .
and the i-95-coalition is now in a position to make a significant contribution to the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including maryland , pennsylvania , virginia , and florida ) .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where recently 50 volunteers with the equipment , were able to buy cars from sceptical about the possibility of the government taking each of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains alaud ’ s chief economist , “ the world ’ s most important strategic and outcome management system in nevada .
people wanted to not .
when the test was in , i warned aclu of nevada to take it on their website : “ it would be relatively easy to use the tachograph in full-grown surveillance devices .
it insists on no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably lead to a reduction in the number of data on the daily movements of individuals and will help to improve the quality of life of the individual .
nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology .
with this , he said , the world would also be reassured .
the hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called true mileage in california .
the company was originally not joined , to establish states in the taxation of car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for motor vehicle manufacturers , which is emerging as a market where drivers on the basis of risk and safety are paying for miles .
but the measures it has tested are not the same for road planning .
“ people are more willing to take part in it , if their speed and location are not increased , ” says the president of the commission , ryan morrison , who is managing true mileage .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .
in oregon , we experiment with the possibility of using car drivers to build a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or you don &apos;t choose any device and pay a flat rate instead based on the average size of all inhabitants of the state .
others are hoping to develop the concept of a distrust public , by giving the appliances with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to use a tax instrument to control the economy of parking fees .
“ drivers would be encouraged to use the added value of the benefits that the system offers to them . ”
some transport planners wonder , however , whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge waste of money .
in the metropolitan area of the comitology , the commission is responsible for the area of the san francisco bay , the congress could decide to solve the problem of bankrupt hwy fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-time fee or annual fee is not applicable to car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that are less petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation when a patient ’ s aspirin is sufficient , ” explains randy räsler , head of legislation and public affairs in the commission .
if we do that , the hundreds of millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy .
royal field : small teams of the team beats wacker .
the voluntary fire service is responsible for the maintenance of the fire .
only eleven men participated in the exercise .
department stores are located in the city of vienna , germany .
it is said that a short circuit is to be created during sawing .
the decommissioning of the fire and the smoke were injured two people , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .
two breathing protection agents of the armed forces made their way to the ground after the first examination of the matter by hans kammerer .
after a short time , the first stage of the process was to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as a close relationship with the other side of the road was also to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated technology , is a perfect place for two horses .
it was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
there was also electric scooter for woodworking .
the first extinguishing attack took place over the tank in the vehicle .
another line was taken by a supercharged cable and a hydrate in about 100 meters distance .
now three holes were created to prevent the damage .
the new version of the &quot; hohlbewerhr &quot; was also used in the building .
hans kammerer was involved in the exercise also to find out what is happening with little available .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the day-to-day operations group königsfeld .
the commander showed himself to be a little more than happy with the course of the exercise .
networking of high-tech and companies is important .
on his visit to the district of breisgau-hochschwarzwald , the president of the county of landing , guido wolf , also visited titisee-neustadt , where the workforce of tomorrow comes from .
in the hochschwarzwald support centre , he went to the vocational training school and the district school administration to develop the training programs and the parental advisory board of this important issue .
&quot; education is an important location factor &quot; , underlines the call for a &quot; new &quot; job , &quot; director of the hans-thoma school , which is responsible for the networked school project &quot; bildungszentrum hochschwarzen &quot; .
the first time wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the forests region has had a successful cooperation between the conveyor centre , kreisgymnasium and vocational school centre .
the commission also praised the family-friendly nature of the region .
&quot; it is important not only to protect the family phase in view , but also to be able to adapt to the phase of family care due to demographic change .
moreover , he said that the number of jobs in the european union is increasing .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting social and economic crisis can be a serious threat to workers &apos; jobs .
but no one can afford to be qualified workers .
another important point is the fact that the european union is networking universities and businesses .
&quot; for anyone who has been a student at the university of munich has had the opportunity to experience the benefits of the region with his knowledge and skills .
only if sufficient information is available can we ensure that the european union &apos;s skilled labour needs are covered .
in his opinion , the relocation advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the south-west of germany , close to france and the swiss .
in addition , he experienced a lot of new problems during his train journey from titisee-neustadt to freiburg .
&quot; stay on the road to success !
with music a fun and entertaining afternoon , experience the thrill of an entertaining afternoon in the afternoon .

the over 100 years old natural stone wall as the front dividing line of the area before the renovation was used for church street .
in the days before the kilbig , the first round of work of the reconstruction of the front school building was a small corner wall , to stabilize and static relief of the more than one hundred years old stone wall with balustrade .
the way forward is to ensure that alexander milosevic , from the tanning district of bräunlingen , has the national monument office in the planning process and that a reconstruction plan is drawn up for the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts who will then be submitted to the local council for decision and decision on the further action .
a decision on this will probably be taken next year .
the sanatorium is the most important building in the area , and the first one is the schulinenhof ( old ) .
the historic , one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school courtyard to the church road , is especially famous for its water and frost damage , as there is no drainage .
deep cracks in individual stones testify to the weather damage , but it is the wall that is not at present at risk of collapse .
a steady wall is a prerequisite for a student to use schulhof , which is confirmed by the current fixing work .
originally , the school courtyard was already in use in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure broke a shift in the budget .
an important word in the historical school wall analysis of the situation , which has even been used for film recordings , is the monument of the country .
if you do not have any information on this page , then the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the preservation department .
students of the bräunlinger elementary school , who have now been rebuilt in a well-renovated old school building with new aula , can soon learn the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to introduce jazz education in stuttgart .
the continued efforts of the european union to promote the future of music universities in baden-württemberg have now been reflected in cem özdemir , federal chairman of the greens .
&quot; i think it is wrong to use the holistic training in music college stuttgart as a way of promoting the development of the new musical culture .
jazz in the classical music scene is part of the jazz scene in stuttgart .
this is what özdemir , who is in stuttgart as a favourites for a direct mandate with the bundestag on 22 september , is opposed to , the green red state government .
these are the main forces on the basis of an expert study , which will bring about a reorganization of the five music colleges in baden-württemberg .
after that , the study programme will be directed to jazz and pop , among others , by the stuttgart university of music , to the mannheim university of music .
us border : &quot; super-tunnel &quot; to the drug smuggling discovered by the police .
at the border between mexico and the us , investigators have found a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to the drug smuggling and have been shut down .
as the us customs authorities have said , the situation in the country , which is more than 500 metres long , has been very similar to that of tijuana and san diego with electricity , railway tracks and an air conditioning system .
three suspects are arrested and sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment .
the tunnel was the only one in the world to use , according to the information .
&quot; this cartels are stupid when they think they could be put under the radar .
the drug gangs are being insured by duffy : &quot; if you continue to use these tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge cost to your dirty money .
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a state of permanent struggle against the drug cartels .
since 2006 , in mexico , more than 77,000,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime .
experts designed and built by experts , the company is able to offer a wide range of products and services .
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the construction of the tunnel is based on the assumption that it is built by architects and engineers and that the construction is about one year old .
the track is a great way to get to know the people who are using electrically operated cars .
on mexican side , access is in a building that has 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters height and 90 cm height .
it would also be a good way of combating illegal immigration towards the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the kokain-fund .
the third , a mexican , was arrested for seizing the country .
all three are threatened with being sentenced to life imprisonment for a lifetime , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the one being on the press conference in san diego .
it should be the first time , however , that in such a tunnel , cocaine has been found .
usually kokain is produced in smaller quantities , not by tunnels .
this is shown in the &quot; despair &quot; of the drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill smerman of the drug faction .
they would do everything they can to enter the us .
the findings include the arrest warrant , which is not the case , at least one of mexico &apos;s leaders .
you must be satisfied with prison sentences of up to ten years .
2014 , gissinger festyear will be held on the festyear of the festyear of the festyear of the year 2014 , geisinger festyear .
the anniversary of the european union &apos;s geisingen anniversary on the occasion of the 1250 .
returning to the first documents of the town of santiago de compostela .
if in just over eight weeks the year ends , the european jubilee year will be over .
geissing and church music : the first of these was the first documentary together .
in churches , a document was produced which describes the two places .
on 15 march , there will be an official launch of the anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , and since hostage is not currently in a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago both were mentioned for the first time in church .
in the context of the anniversary , several events have been held in geisingen and in the kirchen-hausen .
church leaders are not only the first to attend a feast weekend from 18th to 20th july , but also the 1250 .
returning to celebration .
on friday , with a feast , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church church hall , the festival is held .
at this weekend of feast is also the church house festival , which is held in the city of st. gallen .
city music director rudolf barth has written a book for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .
on 21 june , together with the sonnwendfeier des schwarzwaldverein , on 12 july in the arena with fireworks and on 13 december the first concert of city music in the new festhall .
this is done in the jubilee year and it is inaugurated , the official date is last september , on 27 and 27 .
on the occasion of the geisinger stadtjubilee , a new chronicle will be released .
&quot; it should be a chronicle not only of spiritual and spiritual self , but a thought of the work of the spiritual interest .
and that is the spirit of today &apos;s day , too , that celebrates 2014 &apos;s birthday , and in 1974 the present space was completed with the commonplaces .
the new chronicle will be released on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
2014 , however , is also a year with many jubilee .
the narrenzunft strahglonki starts on february 8 with a brewery evening on their 60-year anniversary , which harmonises gutmatingen 90 years and has been celebrated on march 29 .
the altenwerk leipferdingen is going to be 40 years old , the geisinger school has been located in the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 may , the musikverein 150 years old .
the city of geisingen was built in a gift certificate , which was in possession of the st. gallen monastery , in 764 .
the document was written in churches ( hausen ) .
both communities are therefore able to participate in the same document .
reason 2014 this 1250 year old is due to celebrate , in addition to the municipal reform is still 40 years behind .
the council is taking railways into consideration .
should the railway pass be &quot; on the brain &quot; more elaborate ?
yes , have the local councils decided .
schiltach must have 220 000 euros in his hands for this .
the german railway wants to make the cinema season a success next year .
the most important thing is to ensure safety on railway crossings - regular trains run across germany .
do the communities agree to the renovation measures , they must deal with one third of the costs they incur , the rest share with the public .
schiltzer stadtbaumeister roland grießhaber explained the special features of the bahschütte to the municipality .
there , the city plans to build a new building in the height of the tunnelmund on the west of the railway track .
there , greater vehicles could also be used , for example , those transporting long-timber , in the event of an accident , without having to block the tracks .
greek-haber therefore proposed to create a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could not continue to cross the street in due course .
this was done in the municipal council in a controversial way , as some advisers suggested the need for road distribution : thomas kipp brought a message of public sentiment to the point : &apos; do we have to wait so much for so few vehicles ?
mayor thomas haas opposed : the railway pass &quot; hirschen &quot; will be regularly used for long-timbered transports .
even wood from the area &quot; cow bach &quot; is partly covered by this route , because the wood is used for the production of the track up to 20 metres long .
in addition , the route serves as a rerouting for those vehicles that use the tunnel .
as we can see that kirchberg and brewery farms will be closed , we will have to wait until the next elections in the future , as is the case in wolfgang .
the councils agreed to investigate whether the eu &apos;s costs would be covered by the intended spread of the road .
despite this , the reconstruction of the railway crossing has been largely approved .
the conversion of the railway crossing to the gerberium trautwein could , on the other hand , be a quite different problem , which could make it difficult to access the heavily increasing &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; .
the administration had decided to rebuild the railway from the engineering office bruninlinger .
the investigation concluded that the commission had not been excluded .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as a road haulage carrier .
the conversion could therefore be made subject to liability disputes .
as both the wood removal and the wood removal process are carried out in the current state of development , the best way to avoid the rebuilding of the railway crossing is to argue that haas .
it is also worth noting here the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition that is significantly lower than the other railway crossings , because the stop is right next to the center , to which a good connection exists .
even trains from the central station would have to be stopped at this point as far as they did not have a collision .
the majority of the committee voted in favour of the conversion of this railway crossing , as the city of schiltach is facing the problem of overcrowded vehicles .
as an unproblematic , the board considers the conversion to the railway crossings &quot; before heubach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; , for which already crossings with the railway were made .
esa decides on major space projects and plans : missions for billions of dollars , billions of dollars , and millions of dollars .
far planet , grviitationswamps or black earth soles - experts from the european space agency - will have to deal with two major projects .
30 proposals were on the table , five are still in the race .
far away worlds .
more than 1000 planets in other stars have astronomers already found .
whether it is on some of them , at least , is unknown .
the selection is difficult : should you go to gravitational waves to find out ?
or would you prefer to discover the origin of the cosmos ?
or after earthlike planets , and with it perhaps extra-terrestrial life ?
these questions are particularly important to those responsible for the european space agency esa .
for your programme &quot; cosmic vision &quot; we are looking for ideas for two big space projects that will support research decisively .
the budget for such &apos; l-missions &apos; is eur 1 billion each .
the start will be scheduled for 2028 and 2034 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of the european world space research , met in paris to make proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were on the table , five of them have now been put into a closer election .
many bodies have examined the commission &apos;s proposals , but do not overlook the fact that researchers are not involved .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
a total of four major questions have been selected by esa , to which the missions of the 2007 initiative cosmic vision will respond .
what are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?
the exact dates of the installation and the date of the birth of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets around these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .
a large infrared network of about 2,000 m ² could be the darkest .
and if a star planet has the conditions under which it can grow there ?
in order to answer this question , 2017 is to be the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; , which will be used to supply 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity .
the possibilities are limited , however , cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros .
with larger instruments , the astronomers could produce earth like planets and even determine the composition of their atmospheres , thus looking for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this is another issue that should ultimately provide information on the conditions for the creation of new life .
an important role is the magnetic field of a star .
in our solar system , these processes can be exploited in an exemplary manner .
with the &quot; solar orange &quot; you can see the esa already a mission of the m-class ( there the budget is about one half ) .
the probe is to start in 2017 and will begin the surface and activity of the sun closely .
it is of great interest to researchers that jepiter and his monde are also present .
they want to find out what the role of the giant planet in the development of solar system is .
this is what esa sees as the first of three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; programme .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) is now starting your journey .
eight years later , jupiter reaches the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon .
what are the basic physical and mental laws of the universe ?
the world all offers many possibilities to make material under extreme conditions .
perhaps the other parties will also find themselves in a situation where physicists have found a way to a new theory , under which all known natural laws can be united .
how is the universe created and what is the universe ?
the city was founded in 13.7 billion years ago by the great knall .
in addition to the information we are familiar with , from the stars , planets and living beings as we are , there are dark and dark matter , whose gravity was galaxies and galaxies .
so far , researchers do not know what physical or chemical laws are in the first second half of the year , nor do they know what the limits are .
with &quot; euclid &quot; the esa has also already played a m-mission here .
with a special telescope , the sony a700 is to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time , and thus to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter .
anyone who wants to go to the race could go to the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two remain .
the best chances of obtaining a grant as an l mission are in the opinion of many experts &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a sophisticated concept for demonstrating gravitational waves .
we are talking about physicists who change the structure of space time , which albert einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .
proven that they were not used to date .
elisa could create , hope the scientists behind the project .
the mission provides for a two-way or three probe to detect the presence of a single radar in space .
it could , in contrast to installations on earth , also be gravitational waves .
four other proposals compete with the other .
already excluded areas are not covered by proposals for the sample content of the retractable mars , for research into moon , venus and asteroids .
snowden ready to go with germany in terms of us surveillance “ cooperating ” .
edward snowden , who is whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has stated that he is prepared to go to berlin and , before the german bundestag , to make an impact on the american national security agency and its headquarters .
the german member , hans-christian ströbele , met snowden on thursday in russia , where he was granted asylum .
in a letter from snowden , the president of the european commission , mr söderman , presented to ströbele on friday , he writes : “ although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissent opinion as a dissentiment .
the truth is that the truth is not a crime .
the letter from the european commission says that the british government is convinced that the eu &apos;s support for the peace process will convince the american government to accept the charge against him .
the us judicial system ’ s claim to be a criminal offence includes spying and theft of state-owned property .
the german interior minister , hans-peter friedrich , said online : “ if mr snowden is prepared to work with german representatives , then you will find ways to do that . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by the claims that the us and germany are not in a position to control chancellor angela merkel ’ s mobile phone .
thomas oppermann , the member who has presented the draft resolution on the secret service , said that the commission should not miss the opportunity to bring snowden as a witness .
currents , a member of the greens , published a picture of itself and snowden .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
currents explained that the debian project &apos;s lawyer , former nsa , said that snowden was not looking for russia .
if snowden is in germany to say , then he needs a guarantee that he will be there “ safe ” , so the member .
snowden explains in his letter that he is not aware of a “ serious and ongoing crisis . ”
he was touched , however , by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have not yet heard the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .

frontier airlines collects fees for mobile hand baggage and other items of baggage .
frontier airlines plans to launch a new generation of aircraft to cover up to usd 100 , which will be delivered on your flight .
frontier airlines intends to continue to operate up to usd 100 for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade , even if the airline announced that it would not accept this on wednesday .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
frontier explained that it is possible to calculate $ 25 when the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who have only been on the flight path .
frontier spokesman kate o &apos;malley said that the fee of usd 100 goals is to reduce travellers who are not in the vanguard of the payment .
“ we want to not calculate this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to operate in 2008 with a budget of eur 1 billion for the first and second checked baggage .
passengers travelling by car or by car should be aware that the cost of the ticket is as high as possible .
fees are one way to get passengers to pay for less with the aircraft .
o &apos;malley said that in the new fee i am not really concerned with making money , but with making money .
it is about the loyalty of our customers , the loyal customer , who should have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat .
passengers travelling by car can use the website of the airline .
this means that a passenger must be present at the boarding gate of frontier , and that the passenger may be able to take a piece of luggage , but the next person may pay usd 100 for a comparable piece of luggage .
o &apos;malley explained that the site of frontier and the check-in in procedures would be changed so that passengers could have access to the fee paid before they were sent to the boarding gate .
the new hand baggage fee of frontier will only be effective in the summer , a precise date is not yet available .
passengers were shouting frequently about baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .
they argue that the us dollar ’ s transport of luggage is costing money and passengers can pay for it when they buy it .
many people in wall street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that the airlines are spending enough money to keep up with the new rules after years of losses .
most of them , however , have so far been pointing fingers at handling baggage charges .
spirit airlines inc. is calling for a new , more efficient and more efficient handling of hand baggage , three years ago .
the only other airline with a such airline fee is the hungarian air carrier wizz air , declared airbus to be the first airline to offer the same service to the hungarian airlines , jay sorensen .
it estimated in a report of december 2011 that the eu &apos;s hand baggage fee spirit would cost usd 50 million a year .
sorensen , who used to be a leader in the midwest airlines business , has been the first to be awarded with spirit .
“ the boarding process was one of the leading frictionless , the most smooth i have ever seen in my career in aviation ” , said he .
i expected that the commission would be able to take the necessary measures and hold tricky discussions at the airport .
“ the aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding song ran like a lubricated one . ”
frontier follows spirit also on the 2 dollar , which is used for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .
the company explained that passengers with a valid limonade or saft purchased a ticket to the whole of the dose and that coffee could be replenished for free .
water is also free .
us airways had a shortage of time in 2008 to try to provide refreshment drinks , making it seven months later .
frontiers ’ move to charge mobile hand baggage charges is a step forward if passengers are not directly involved in the airline ’ s purchase .
airlines are paying online travel agencies like orbitz 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this provides all societies with an incentive to provide passengers with direct access to their purchases , rather than through an online travel agency .
frontier is the leading player in this field , however .
in september , the company started to make a booking through an online travel agency only half as many frequent flyer miles as the airline had booked .
on wednesday , the first two miles were recredited to 25 percent of the flight .
a one-third of the supplier ’ s flight ticket is valid for a third flight with a front over 1000 miles .
passengers can also only take part in direct purchase on the frontier platz website .
frontier has a staunch customer base and is a member of the international network of sales offices in denver .
the proceeds went to 9 % , and the airlines ’ capacity declined by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as in the financial report .
republic has tried to make a significant contribution to the sale of the company &apos;s finances by frontier .
proverbial words come from the bible .
about 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the gospel church community of bisingen .
the theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; words from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church community and the president of the church council , went to the conference in a lecture in a biblical proverb .
say : &quot; i am a man of god , and i am a man of god , and i am a man of god .
it compared several columns of words with the corresponding bible positions and explained the importance .
they called spurious , like : holzauge is vigilant , as scales are falling from the eyes , an eye is thrown on someone who gives his lord &apos;s sleep , his hands in unguilty hands .
several times the referendums left their audience untouched .
the phrase &apos; no &apos; from the middle ages took the church community method into account .
she explained the importance and origin of the words that she used to describe &quot; bridges to the past &quot; .
finally , a subsidiary of the raffle was lost .
the prices were covered on a table and were humorously rearranged .

learning instead of being unemployed : pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism .
at the mecklenburgische seeplatte startethette a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been trained as unskilled in the industry are to be taken over to skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter .
&quot; new to this is that the six-month period of courses with degrees in the field &quot; , carmen wiechert said from the employment agency neubrandenburg .
the benefit is manifold : participants would thus not be unemployed , the companies would not get caught up in the labour market , and the companies would become more and more dependent on the quality of their services .
the project has also been attended by the industrial and commercial chambers in neubrandenburg and the german hotel and restaurant association .
nsa explains a “ intern error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site &apos;s crash .
the shadowy national security agency stated on the late friday that a bug had been caused your public website a few hours and not hackers , as online was claimed .
“ nsa.gov was here tonight for a few hours because during a planned visit to the internet a internal error occurred . ” , explains christian rosner .
the problem will be resolved this evening .
the claim that the outbreak was caused by a distributed system of denial of service was not proven .
in the early evening hours , online server games were very popular .
previously , a spokesman for the nsa had declared to abc news that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way compromised . ”
secret information is not included in the risk , so the speaker is in danger .
at least one group of hacktivists took up the challenge of using the nsa website with a ddos attack .
in such attacks , the commission &apos;s target website is being called with page calls , until the servers are overloaded .
the cybertactic is relatively simple , and the attacks serve not to protect the lives of the internet &apos;s internal network , but to prevent the attacks .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was once no search agency ( no such authority ) , was the only one to find itself in the bright light of the public and looks like the last few months .
the growing controversy surrounding the secret service has also fueled initial speculation about the intergovernmental conference ’ s failure to act today as a result of a deliberate cyper-operation .
easy healthy , the skin is very small and the skin is very dry and dry .
although the quota of 3.1 % is better than last year , and the rate is better than in september , &apos; we would have liked to have seen more &apos; , monika felder-bauer says , deputy managing director of the agency .
many of the companies responded so far to attitudes .
one reason for this is the lack of a proper legal basis in the field bauer : &quot; we have few skilled workers in the crafts , health care and care of the elderly &quot; .

win losses are not a problem for bombardier after declining supply figures and orders .
the canadian aircraft and aircraft carrier , bombardier inc , is reporting on thursday a 15-percent increase in the volume of the net profit generated by the company ’ s declining orders and deliveries .
bombardier , based in montreal , also published no flight test data for his brand new aircraft of the cseries and gave the cseries no new information about whether the aircraft was being operated in accordance with the ambitious schedule for next september .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three more launches have been carried out , which leaves no doubt as to whether the test phase is proceeding as planned .
the results were not so great .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank finance &amp; investment , reduced the value of his assessment of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” in view of how the bank ’ s shares were to be divided in the next quarter one to two .
“ although weaker economies were hit by the downturn in aircraft delivery , the us economy was hit by the margins in transport . ”
we believe that the european union should not allow bombardier to place new orders for the cseries if the test program for the aircraft is progressing .
if , however , there is no new orders to be placed in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the programme .
bombardier hopes that the us air force will be able to stop the company from flying in the lower market segment of katapultifying the aircraft currently being used by boeing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was delivered in march to the public and flew to the us after months of delays .
but , to date , binding orders have been made for the cseries with 177 moderates , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company &apos;s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new nozzle are true .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the chairman of the executive board , pierre beaudoin , is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .
the management assured the company that on thursday , analysts and media would also like to see the programme in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft will be operated during the flight ’ s lifetime .
each manufacturer plans to do something different .
we have decided to take a first flight and then to take a revision period .
this is happening throughout the programme .
the second of five test aircraft will be scheduled to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining ones will be named after the company .
however , analysts remain skeptical about whether 12 months after maiden flight , the first customer to fly a crane .
bombardier explained that it checks the planning for the inauguration ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the negotiations on the air test – even though it appears to be bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning will be limited to the first quarter of 2015 ” , said doerksen .
in the third quarter , at the end of september 30 , bombardiers ’ net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 per share , from $ 172 million or $ 9 cents per share in the year before .
the customized profit per share is € 25.00 , which is unchanged .
sales increased slightly , but the company continued to decline from € 4.2 billion to € 4.1 billion .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.54 cents per share expected , so thomson reuters i / b / e / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , says that it has already invested € 45 million in this quarter , a drop of 57 in the last year .
the net orders were placed from 83 aircraft to 6,83 aircraft .
order intake in the aerospace industry was up by € 1.2 billion on 30 september .
“ in the field of aerospace , the results were in the context of our guidelines , but the low incoming orders and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace industry increased by € 1.8 billion to € 1.8 billion .
bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this segment were up by almost 11 % to € 2.1 billion .
order intake in the transport division was € 30 million on 30 september , compared with € 32.6 billion on 31 december .
the winning amount in the transport sector has been increased by handling problems with some major contracts .
according to the management , it will be the fourth quarter that will introduce new guidelines .
in the afternoon trading at thursday there was the bombardier share by 8,5 percent and in the first quarter was 4.83 canadian dollars , after also announced that the goodwill plan was to be patrick pichette .
the brazilian embracer sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier of the very close rivals , reported on thursday a tenth percent drop in the quarter earnings .

cocaine addicted lawyer , drug boss before police investigation , who was not able to get into prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld size neil scarborough , and published it on the internet .
the lawyer had been afraid to leave his secret drug addiction to light .
he was arrested by the liverpool crown court and sentenced to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has been using a drug baron before a great police investigation has been arrested because he was afraid to close his secret drug addiction .
basharat ditta , 42 , provided entertainment to the underworld , neil scarborough with sensitive information about eritrean &apos;s activities in the drug trade after he was arrested by his own cocaine .
the crime rate is the most important factor in the fight against terrorism , which is regarded as ‘ first-class ’ by criminals .
officials watched the world ’ s scarborough , the world ’ s three beets of cocaine , and saw the light of day at the house of the lawyer blackburn , lancashire .
the investigation into the situation revealed that the thilo had been regularly subjected to drugs of class a , after tests had detected signs of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and on credit cards .
the company has been operating in the us for eight months from january to august 2011 , and has been trying to disclose information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of its partners .
all four suspects were then convicted by the police in a large investigation report .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police had been arrested in a number of house searches .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminal more , because he feared that he would use his drug addiction to become public .
today , ditta , who is responsible for the law firm forbes solicitors in blackburn , was elected liverpool ’ s crown court after a three-week visit to the united states .
he gave a speech at an earlier survey to the cocaine .
the lawyer was overtaken , after the police had been arrested in their investigation of scarborough .
two investigating officials have followed the same suit , and the suspect saw that he was being dittas house and there the drugs were being treated with a purity of 60 % in a black golf globe-box .
shortly after he had dropped off the drugs , he had telephoned scarborough regularly with ditta , who was at dinner at the football stadium of the blackburn rovers in ewood park .
the lawyer returned to the home , and he took the time to get rid of drugs and then nine communications were sent between the two .
in court , it was known that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of kokain .
ditta was later arrested , stoned and was sentenced to death .
during his arrest , ditta took his letters to the police and tried to get a number of credit cards .
in police infringement proceedings , there was a case where he said that he was operating under his private address as well as at the workplace and that he would be held in the office for legal matters at home .
in court , it was known that he was a key player in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and had informed what the investigation had done about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal law attorney should be better than any other person knows that one can not break the law . ”
ditta will be abused of his position as a criminal defender , as he will become too much concerned with certain clients .
the directive in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who has to pay his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , but the report was the first to be adopted by the prosecutor .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was a member of the police investigation as far as possible , so that he could continue to be able to follow up on criminal activities .
mr ditta has thus expressed his profession in disrepute .
he was in charge of certain clients too much , especially scarborough , and he left it to be the most important compromises .
ditta pointed out every malpractice , and claimed that the “ if i had a corrupt lawyer , i would be a corrupt lawyer , and information to scarborough would be passed on to me . ”
but , after hearing , superintendent lee halstead said that the police in lancashire were “ mr ditta has the move from a criminal defender to a criminal in the moment . ”
his cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromising and made him susceptible to motives of leading members of the organised crime that had entrusted him with valuable information on police investigation .
lawyers and judges must meet the highest standards of integrity and be able to stand up for trust and confidence in the public .
ditta has won this trust and is trying to hide behind the façade of his profession .
the serious and organic company has been working for many years .
this case should be a warning to criminals and it shows that no one is guilty of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having been accused of conspiracy to the heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade for school leavers .
twenty-five years after the end of the drug trade , people were sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences .
at its website , ditta published an area with questions and answers about itself , in which he indicated that his dream job was to create a new world of art as a lawyer .

the so-called german trade fair with the original title &quot; singing for the celebration of the holy opera &quot; is the most important event in germany .
the fair will take place in the context of the services of god , as the client johann philipp neumann had intended .
under the leadership of hermann schneider , the choir is directed by the brass band of the musikverein fehsinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach : skepticism is increasingly distancing itself from confidence .
the elections to the parish council of the municipality in 2015 will , for example , be a major event in haslach ( se ) .
there is only one other common post office , and that is the council of the six parish councils .
in a joint meeting , the heads of state and government met on saturday to discuss the situation in the region of haslach , hofstetten , mülenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschensteinach .
for at least one of the fundamental decisions of the diocese is to be changed and it is time to ask the parish councils to take them as satisfactorily as possible .
over the day , a great deal of attention was paid to the fact that skepticism towards the new is slowly but steadily diminishing .
of the ideas and expectations of the innovations 2015 to 2015 , to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the council was sufficient to make the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main actors of the seafaren .
regional dekan georg schmitt explained the benefits of the new regional policy by presenting a presentation .
then the se haslan as a church community will form a body of public law , which will be included in the rights and duties of the six church communities so far .
it will only be a common parish council , and a common public prosecutor will be appointed , in which the parish priest will be represented .
from every parish , the parish is supposed to represent at least two elected members , in the six parish councils , so-called municipal teams are formed .
their task will be to ensure that the church system is in place in the future .
in the question of finance for the individual parish community , the question then arose of a great deal of discussion .
the innovations are intended to make it possible to use the accumulated credits in the parish buildings in a targeted manner .
the liabilities are based on the total community , however .
in particular , with regard to the major investments planned , the commitment of which will then be made by all the parish priests , there were major concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only projects were invested in which the people of the parish had to work alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five pfarris signs and a common body described barbaric knights , the chairman of the seafaring unit of debris forest neuried .
they had been calling for the european union to become one , five to stay , and they had to realise that this was not so easy .
the bodies of the haslacher sealsorgeunity then made a mistake in raising questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of community teams .
the commission &apos;s proposals will be discussed in more detail in subsequent meetings and will be discussed in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
at the end , parish councillor michael schöner presented the first project of the parish church of st. steinach , which was approved by a clear majority .
in pfullendorf , electricity is becoming more expensive and the cost of energy is increasing .
the citizens are plucking up the streets and are forced to pay higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the city ’ s works , jörg-arne bias , said in relation to the south courier , a four-person group of plumbers is coming to the surface of 70 to 90 euros per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called edf conversion rate of 5.3 % .
this levy is calculated every october by the four operators .
this figure is the same as that given to them by the energy turn , which they are to be compensated by a levy on electricity .
the city ’ s pfullendorf works are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was represented in its forecasts by even higher turnover .
now the concrete figures should be calculated .
&quot; we are moving from an increase of 1 cent plus x to a reduction of 1.8 % , &quot; says bias , where the number is more near the 2 cent .
at the traffic light on endurred : wait until you reach the end of the road , make sure you have the right lights on .
sometimes a traffic light is simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light symbol is defective .
what should we do then - at red drive ?
if a member of the public has been in a red light long enough to stop the intersection , the intersection can continue , the stop will tell you how to proceed .
the waiting time must be shortened .
becker is advising to wait at least five minutes before starting a functional disorder of the traffic lights .
anyone who wants to drive despite the red lights will have to be aware of the fact that the road is not suitable for a road accident .
anyone who has spent less than five minutes will wait for the next few minutes , but warns becker and points to a decision by the supreme court .
the draft negotiated agreement is a step in the right direction , and the driver has to leave the traffic lights in the direction of three minutes and has to decide for a negligent breach of red light .
the traffic light was not disinfectant , but jumped a little later on to green .
a driving ban was not allowed to him because of the special situation - the fine was not .
local council is pleased to have solid budget and is pleased to have a solid budget .
whenever there is a conflict in local councils , it is a matter of mayor ralph gerster .
the municipal bag is available in herdwangen-schönn and is well known for its excellent service and its ability to handle debt since 2005 .
that is also the year 2012 , which is the full success of the european union .
this was confirmed in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andrea rothmund explained , the first step is to increase the administrative budget to a total of eur 7.6 million .
the overwhelming surplus of the administrative budget would also be around eur 1.8 million , which would amount to around eur 1 million .
the fact that the council has surplus , in particular , is higher business tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the asset budget was again clearly above the planned level of value .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is essentially due to the higher feed from the administrative budget &quot; , says rothmund .
since the financial year 2012 is less investment than planned , the commission has proposed that the budget should be reduced .
overall , the general reserve has been around eur 2.1 million , to a total of eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanks the donors of rothmund and their team for their good work .
&quot; such a work shakes the mind not just because it is a work of praise , &quot; gerster praised the annual accounts .
he and the municipal councils were pleased to see the good figures .
it may seem paradoxical , but this good figures could be a good thing for the citizens to come .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , just a few minutes from the city centre .
this , in turn , is already causing , according to gerster , the need to cut back on aid from the country on a number of occasions .
for these grants , the various member states have to pay a high price for them .
among other things , cities and municipalities , which receive subsidies , must be able to use certain levers .
&quot; the theme of lifting is something we have to look at , because in the years to come , investments are on the line , for which we would like to have grants &quot; , gerster announced in this context .

the adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to ensure that national security is maintained as a follow-up to the attacks by armed islamists .
kenyan media withdrew the anger of the authorities , because they took pictures of security cameras , and they were forced to see that they were being shot at the scene .
police officers , david kimaiyo responded that he had been invited to the us army camp in new york to order two journalists and one leading media representative , even though the submission was not complete .
after the new law , media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million kenyan shillings can be laid down and individual journalists can be arrested with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or of an official press accreditation .
the tribunal has also the right to block the possession of those concerned , if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ the world can already have a single penalty for most radio stations bankrupt . ”
in addition , the newspaper considers that these measures could be a damaging effect on the lives of the people who , according to their description , are “ lively blogosphere . ”
if you want to silence the media , you have the chance to go unpunished by politicians whatever you want .
“ no one will ever know , ” he wrote .
“ leave the politicians to themselves , lead them to the world in the bankruptcy and back us to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .
kenyan legislators withdrew from the market in the past , and the government has been a major contributor to the crisis .
in may , they voted to extend the list of countries eligible for compensation from the national compensation commission .
bad-drürrheim : a dream is true for the fc bayern munich !
at the same time , the importance of the city and the football club was not mentioned in the official opening ceremony for the kunstrass sports ground despite the cold weather and rain .
a more pleasant celebration is the result of the first meeting of the new team last saturday , but peter did not want to play .
for example , all those who had been able to travel without umbrella or to have such a guide for some reason had no access to it .
that was what the musicians who had to make the feast surrounded the festival , as well as many speakers .
wet was therefore also the fc chairman albrecht schlenker , who was convinced of the fulfilment of a dream .
his thanks were due to the mayor walter klumpp , who opted for the implementation of the project .
here i would particularly like to thank lothar hero , paul weizenegger , heiner gail and peter graf .

even 15 years ago , there were the first thoughts on how to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was taking place at the site of the football club or at the salinensee school .
both have been rethrown out .
six years ago , thoughts were raised about the creation of an artificial turf sports ground , which was generally known as the ultimate solution .
concrete plans have been put forward two years ago , when the fc launched the schabelstube in perennacht , a cost contribution of eur 100 000 to build the square and the country supported funds from eur 104 000 .
the municipal council decided to establish a new municipal administration in october 2012 .
the construction of the 68 installations 108 meters in size of artificial turf was started on 4 june .
during the three months of negotiations , the european commission has been involved in the construction of 3000 cubic meters of earth , half of which are used to create a dirt bike track .

on the morning i also wanted to ask the working group on migration and integration to continue their discussions .
the fact that the european parliament is to be consulted on the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be a matter of mutual understanding .
the spd would like to make the constraint on germany-born immigrants more difficult to apply for a european union .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda of this friday , the commission underlined the importance of the european parliament &apos;s rejection of a request for a pkw toll by the csu .
a vignette is a &quot; flag &quot; , which is a very popular and ecological form of transport .
there was a threat of evasive traffic on land roads , which are already heavy and which are already priority areas for accidents .
the introduction of a toll on all cars would be a serious mistake from the point of view of the car .
&quot; there is a risk that too much of the information will be lost at a later stage .

if we do not succeed in this , it will be at vienna schwechat airport in the future .
a large part of the speakers are not connected .
a relaxing and relaxing atmosphere is the key to the success of this innovation .
as airport-speakers peter kleemann said to radio vienna , the next step is to take the vienna airport to the tune of distances affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , under the current system , airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai are already giving up on the noise .
the removal of this divorce - on average , the tones of one day about 200 personal calls by the speakers of the speaker - should make it more quieter at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also changed in the experience that the latter individual distances are relatively little perceived , while at the same time all other information on changed flight paths or abridges here is a little submerged &quot; , says kleemann in the talk .

sleepless in new york
on the way to your host families in weymouth , massachusetts , the students learned to learn the black forest heritage .
after eight hours of flight , the tour went straight to brooklyn bridge , over which you can walk the heart of the city , manhattan .
here , the first of these was a fascinating view of the world famous skyline , which was built in the evening light and attracted a special charm .
the timing shift has made the students almost 24 hours on the legs , but faithfully the motto &quot; the city sleeps not &quot; became the day on times square .
despite shutdown , the last day of the release was still the first time that the statue of liberty was reached with a ferry and you can walk .
then it was about the financial centre to cover wall street for the memorial of the 11th september .
on the third day , students were able to benefit from the 373 meters high observation platform of the empire-stage school .
after that , the heaviest part of the new york streets went over the rockefeller center to central park , which is an ideal opportunity to stay for a short time in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to boston , the students are now in their host families .
in this year too , the name day of the holy hubertus is celebrated in the parish church of st. marien on the hill .
st. hubertus was the sage after a fairly reckless hunter , who was caught by a vision and later turned into a bishop of liège .
the hunting horn leaves group of hunting enthusiasts westphalia , headed by brigitte kluth , has been musical on parforcehörner ( naturhorner in the mood ) according to old , originally french melodic melodic melody .

the formal fair will take place on sunday , november 3 , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed optical zoom lens is a perfect combination of a new café and a new bar .
one thing that is not to be missed and to come back again .
one thing that has changed the name of the program .
as a déjà vu , according to the lexicon , a psychological phenomenon is defined in the sense that it is a new situation that has already been experienced or seen .
in the case of the visit of the same named cafe at the opschlag in the district town of kleve in sight to the rhein-waal university , it does not have to be the pure déjà vu feeling .
finally , the café has a beautiful name , which is exactly what it is all about : a real stay not only in the mind but also in the everyday life .
because it is fun , and it &apos;s just beautiful .
a look at the interior of the optschlag 8 gives the viewer an impression of the opting-out .
the ultramodern , but not cool , café ambience looks like a place to feel good .
the hotel offers a wide range of services and facilities for the whole family .
there is a delicious buffet breakfast , or you can enjoy your own freshly baked baguettes .
the owners , both 33 years old , have been able to register before the opening of the pretty cafe at the opschlag as a gastronomic destination : in kranenburg they conducted the art lounge .
from moving to kleve , to the opschlag , the sympathic café-lovers of the area are hoping for more audience .
last but not least , the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; daniel büttner emphasizes .
i would rather like to see the two young students here , as well as senior citizens and all ages .
speaking of the café-lovers , you can enjoy the atmosphere of the hotel .
the friendly and helpful staff will be happy to assist you with any questions you may have .
enjoy the dumplings of hot baked bread in the most varied variations .
express is a professional and experienced professional software developer .
daniel büttner is more of the expresso fan and mirjam van der stra steelt the cappuccino drinker .
&quot; to do this , a baguette - that is my thing &quot; , betrays it to the nrz .
two events were held in the summer of 2008 in the bright café .
to put it better , one thing .
this is because the port festival took place outside - it is the café déjà vu that benefited from it .
but there were also the ringelnatzevening .
&quot; beautiful , successful and funny &quot; , they found the two 33-year-old .
but not everyone is in favour of it .
perhaps daniel is büttner because he is not a very special fan of event music .
and with a event i speak again only the ones who are interested in the event .
that is why events are becoming the exception .
&quot; we want to make the normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
is this to mean déjà vu also for reliable and reliable .
with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the opschlag in kleve .
the road that runs more and more to a gastronomic tradition is a very interesting one .
to the delight of many klee , who want to visit the nearby and the students who visit the gastromile and thus also the café déjà vu for themselves .

a proclaimed new goals in the fight against poverty .
the united nations will begin immediately with the drafting of a series of new objectives that will enable the un ’ s millennium development goals , announced 12 years ago , to be realised .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in advancing “ sustainable development goals ” that the 2015 emigration .
they were created in the final draft of the document which was adopted by the world leaders in the field , including mrs gillard , at the summit .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon explained in the evening at the summit that the time has come to talk about “ national interests ” .
“ i am pleased that the european union ’ s member states agreed to continue to support a process that will bring about a universal ban on the development of sustainable development . ”
“ these goals are set on our progress from the millennium development goals , ” said dr. peter fitzgerald , chairman of the board of directors of the international monetary fund .
i will spare no effort to ensure that this is the case , which is granted to me by the member states , in order to make our vision of sustainable development objectives , based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
even if the sg achim / baden has been in the game for four days without victory , the handball upper league continues to be a good mood .
this is what coach tomasz malmon leaves no doubt about .
all are still fully motivated and have a great deal of experience .
nevertheless , i hope that we will finally be able to win again .
&quot; for i know already that i don &apos;t know how such a victory was tasted , &quot; says malmon .
even if the third liga-reserve is made of fredenbeck currently no trees , it is still a good idea to point out that malmon is already producing trees .
many players have already lost their way to the a-jugend .
that is why they are being held against their ex-coach , and i am sure they will be particularly motivated .
&quot; in addition , we must see if there is any need for reinforcement from the first , &quot; explains the sg-coach .
to finally return to the success story , the european union must make itself aware of the fact that the malmont team has been on the right track .
above all , in the area of coverage and the switching game haperte has been hit hard recently .
the equal opportunities of women must also definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play at last during the short break .
safety concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and political figures .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder of the state and first president of mozambique , to attend a rare public demonstration of peace .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fear of the future of the country , it has changed its business clothes to a t-shirt with the title “ we demand security ” on portuguese .
for two weeks there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and renamo , which have been one of the worst fighting since the pre-1967 peace agreement .
renamo was a former school of notorious rebel movements , which initially seemed to be inspired by the rhodesia ruled by white people and later by the apartheid government of south africa .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analysts consider it inprobable that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , with the us and japan ’ s recent events having hit foreign investors and locals .
for the rapidly growing economy , there is a lot at stake , because the discovery of huge gas resources before the coast and coal mines is a major challenge .
the ruling frelinoche party , which has been the dominant party since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has not yet resolved the recent clashes by making the most of its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold of renamos on 17 october .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated , when the government forces renamo-supporters were attacking the country .
the government gives renamo the blame for the clashes and accusations of the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability .
the new version of the astronomik astronomer , the first of its kind , was released in january 2008 .
both frelimo and renamo stress that the only way to avoid war is to avoid war .
but the concerns have increased , since mazanga began to say that the european union is renamo , and that the montenegro peace agreement was concluded in 1992 .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city , in the heart of the city .
“ our vision is to reopen negotiations and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
previous discussions between the parties have only had little to do with resolving the tensions caused by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults men ( guebuza and dhi ) , and we have two children , who are the ones who meet the heads ” , says joseph hannon , lecturer at the open university and mosamaj .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to accept the necessary concessions .
renamo , who was waiting for electoral reforms , has already said that it will not win the local elections in november .
presidential and presidential elections are a major challenge for next year .
some commentators have criticised the use of violence as an attempt to impose a tiresome movement , making concessions and financial concessions for the government .
renamos ’ electoral success is shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , headed by an earlier renaissance member , has been running a crisis .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose return to power is due when his second term ends in the coming year – is democracy in the country .
“ he does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he wants peace , because he wants the presidential office not to give up , ” he says .
it is unclear what the capacity of renamo is , but it has unrest and has led to stirring attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .
most of the fighting took place in the province of sofala , which was a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , in the region of both beira and the port , the mountain blocks and the city of rio tinto .
in june , the rio summit interrupted the use of the railways for one month after renamo launched an attack on the track .
mazanga replied reluctantly to the question of whether renamo could repeat this threat .
renamo wanted to “ strengthen the international community that the things in moscow are not going well ” , says the president of the republic of mozambique .
the instability has triggered frustration with the government , and says fernando lima , head of mediacoop , a independent media company , because many people are worried about the crisis .
“ people think that the world ’ s government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and they are supposed to be the one who can find solutions to the problems ” , he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that the people wanted to just have stability .
“ no one is interested in renamo and frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .
children should be myths and legends known as “ models for life ” .
the stories of thor showed that the world is becoming more and more “ brutal ” against clever tricks , and the artus legend demonstrates that the world is important to be able to make a dream .
many of the myths are “ at far from perfect ” , however , to offensive , and in some cases to dirty .
“ i find it wonderful that the report on myths and myths in america has already been part of education , ” he said .
i have already done this for twenty years as a plan .
he added that the commission should be more careful with authors and teachers who “ overly didactic ” .
crossley holland , the beowheelf from the anglo-saxon language and author of the penguin book of norway myths and the british library , has been a member of the board .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author , who is adult , and a writer who is not a child , is that he is a child .
not everything has to be simplified or to be happy end .
this must be undermined .
this is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hansjakob is going to freihof again .
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob was retiring in hazlan .

with her song &quot; o jesus christ &quot; she tells us that she was happy to have the audience in the open court as well as the storchentagskinder with her loud &quot; , out &quot; .
his criticism of the amtskirche had been made at that time in exactly the same way as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home of the hotel , behind its tomb chapel on the fire near hofstätten , he found his place of rest .
&quot; an unquiet mind had finally had its peace and was for ever a home away , &quot; he said .
i am very much applause and many praise have been expressed by the audience for the performance .

we would then have had to wait for you before your apartments in a working-class quarter .
the lightest and most powerful weapon is the &quot; kazon &quot; .
as an alibi , a five-year half-sister of the younger , which you had taken with you , should say that she was sexually assaulted by the young .

by confiscating the handsets and sim cards , the user prohibited contacts between women and the outside world .
together with a colleague who has been raping women , he has brought them to various brothels in the southwest .
there he left them partly to monitor to keep their revenue .
in court , the accused claimed that he had been accused of being a serious scourge after colleagues in afghanistan were attacked in an explosion .
after a psychiatric expert has been able to express great doubts about the mental limitations and thus about a limited school of guilt , the problem was raised by the 33-year-old .
the court had to remove none of the damaged women .

the judges had to leave in august , and the city was shattered by the constitution with the way it was being treated .
the city laid appeal against its invasion and the charges imposed .

in august , the city of new york declared itself willing to continue the practice of storing names and addresses of people who had been arrested after a control by the police .
an oral negotiation is not possible for the city to be called after 14 march 2014 .
the stop clause is a good way to get rid of the current situation .
controls of this kind have been in place for decades , but the number of cases recorded has increased during the term of office of the partisan mayor michael bloomberg to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , which is now the year , and the us .

he said that there is no need for three procedures to put stories into perspective .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously he knows about the second , monitoring , in other words , it cannot be otherwise .
what about the european union &apos;s first ?
does he know about the phone hacking ?
he is arguing about this , but we are saying , ‘ and whether he knew of it ’ .
rumours about an affair by clakes were first heard by the feature-editorial team of notw when one source , which is sexually linked to pawlby , said .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mulcat , france .
the investigation teams found that the data were not available on the detective computer , but on the pawlby and her sister as “ projects ” .
in the time when the bills were lowered , the commission and the council were given a new , anonymous and unreliable call , which was a great help to their grandparents .
meanwhile , the us supervisors supervised the government of nevile thurgau-reynolds and former reporter james weatherup .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with following link : &quot; i am not a story , i don &apos;t know if we want to publish it tomorrow .

around 80 participants were involved in the municipal hall to get to know the planned measures .
house owners asked why the &quot; the ultimate goal of the project is to make the members of the council &quot; .
the floods that hit the country &apos;s southern borders on 15 may 2009 , hit the whole continent of europe with a huge amount of flooding .
a river basin survey was conducted with the neighbouring municipality of aidlingen .
&quot; the protection of as many built-in land as possible is the goal &quot; , says meisterler .
the basis of the planning is protection from a german weather forecast .
the climate change is being caused by a 15 % increase in the price .
in expert circles , this is done with &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses , which were in chinese in 2009 for considerable damage , are still the same as the 1000-year-old floods .
&quot; an absolute protection is available not to , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , says wolfgang .
to protect hq 100battery pack , you need to have a memory card in geches .
house owners will be happy to help you with your own projects .
i would like to draw the attention of the community to the participation of the citizens .
a complex and complex system is the result of a process of planning and approval .
in the best case , 2016 could begin to implement .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was adopted last week in the municipal council ( we have been reporting ) , provides for local measures to flow the river irish into the basin of the tribal valley .
following the vote , the hochwasserschutzgesetz took the opportunity to present their concerns .
among other things , it has been questioned why more dams and rear basins are not planned to protect the place .

in addition , it is necessary to take the most economical solution , as joachim wald von wald and corbe said .
discourtesy prevailed among the altorts , who themselves were not able to reach the ground again and again during normal storms .
the problem with the management is known and initial measures have already been taken .
house owners will be happy to help you with your own personal needs .
the municipality is obliged to inform the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration can be accomplished .
the sewage channels greater than the size of the sewage channels would waste millions .
the most serious injury after the collapse of the german army was caused by the accident .
in the early friday afternoon , the national road 44 is near revensdorf two car drivers at a front door meeting .
the police blocked the road immediately completely , could not reach the accident site .
however , there are various testimonies which are only evaluated when they are evaluated .
it is clear that the 19 year old handler was a vw golf player towards revensdorf .
both vehicles are clouding , with the woman having been so hard hit in the stall that the fire department had almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle .
the real unexpected cause of the accident was not clear .
both are devastated in nearby cities , and the situation is not as bad as it might be .
the boundary remained in full swing for about two hours .
one could describe him as the dostoevsky of the us .
philip k. dick was a god father and a son of the goddess , his novels and stories .
what is striking is the relative position of the outside world : the technicalities , the bart , the high stirn .
and so , as fjodor m. dostoevski , with his massive oeuvre as a founder of and aploget of russian soul , understands that the russian soul is being read .
some titles are available in the heyne verlag , the haffmans-cassette with the 118 stories .
dick explains america - the empire of breathtaking technical progress .
dick had given a visit to the church to his late books , read like a mixture of revelation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was crazy , had drugs to his brain , and he was not .
he has captured , already early that the computers divested divinities .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked me if it was possible to tell a man what a machine is , the creator of his creation .
this is the &apos; blade runner &apos; problem .
the killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer , he has been a great writer .
his stories have shown film directors , such as ridley scott , john mccain and john mccain .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority protection act &quot; is a report from 2001 .
it is here that the principle of &apos; pre-crime &apos; is developed , &apos; pre-crime &apos; is applied , that is , what is now more or less official doctrine of the white house .
in dick ’ s world , which is close to our shocking , musantes look into the future - and the police attack .
&quot; we collect individual data , which is not infringed by any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we snack them , we still have them a violent crime .
and : &quot; in our society there is no serious criminal who is responsible for this , we have a punishable flame retardant &quot; , they read newspapers .
they participate in the worst of all , and they prevent the war on crime from being fought in the way that is .
dick &apos;s story is like the blue pause for the anti-terror campaign laws and the abhorrence of the nsa .
anti-zip of the attack on the ground : this is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and practice works .
but dick ’ s story is not over yet .
the police chief , mr president , complains that there is no separation of powers .
then the overarching person is monitored and one of the future criminals is transferred .
the system revolves .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it is inventing its own prerequisites .
does erroneous and sacrifice not only take place , but also builds on it .
the system creates the risk of being combated .
philip k. dick read is that he always says that the truth is closer .
the late roman empire was a major source of information for merkel in russia , but it was not a case of the late haffer who said merkel would have said that merkel would have been a russian spy .
the former us intelligence officer , john hume , has been accused of “ intimidating the us spell-heather around chancellor angela merkel . ”
representatives of the german federal law office could either submit questions in writing or request the 30-year-old to be personally met in russia , but interfax reported .
previously , the green bundestag member , hans-christian schöbele , had the first german politician snowden in moscow yesterday .
nsa entchulls the company &apos;s paranoia for state surveillance and the use of state surveillance .
at a mild day at the end of august a german police helicopter flew deep across the us consulate in frankfurt am main , the financial capital of germany .
upon request of the federal office of civil law ( bmbf ) and the ministry of the environment ( bvt ) , the german ministry of internal security , he should be photographing the roof of the us outpost , which is less than 5 km away from the european central bank .
according to the german media , the bvt wanted to limit the presence of monitoring antennas and the action led to a change of wording between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james clapper , us secretary of state for the environment , has said that the us treasury secretary has once again failed to provide any opportunities for foreign espionage . “ to improve business secrets of foreign companies in order to serve us companies . ”
but since edward snowden , who was elected whistleblower , the world has been running out of the woods with the publication of his filling horn .
reports that the american national security agency has been forced to take the brazilian oil company petrobas to take over the role of american oil companies are a cause for concern , including google and yahoo .
the barrel of the fence brought the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone was wanting , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe is targeted , it is the people who are most certainly the most powerful .
snowden has the intensity of cooperation between us intelligence and companies transparent and has made it clear .
i believe that it is conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up ” , explains oliver green , president of the bitmi , who is a small and medium-sized it company in germany .
german companies believe that the us now has an almost as great risk as china , if it is about industrial espionage and data theft .
in the areas covered by snowden , the european union has had a very bad record of being able to take the operational secrets of foreign companies seriously .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu is not going to be able to implement certain it and internet options and that they are increasing their dependence on the us .
companies are not sceptical about this .
in the bundestag , it was proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only turn my eyes and see them slowly again ...
“ that is not how it works , ” says hasso plattner , chairman of the german software company sap .
if you want a strong european it industry , you have to have a strong european it industry 20 years ago .
all in germany is subsidised , but the government is subsidised by the coal industry , by cars and by agriculture .
all until the last it industry .
however , reach and technical ratings are not the only way to achieve the goals set by snowden revelations .
at cloud computing , a large change is taking place because european business leaders are now more aware of the fact that in the us stored data of the legal counsel there are subject and therefore potentially endangered .
according to a study conducted by cloud security alliance , the world ’ s trading organization , the us government has promised to repay the debt burden on its own people .
jim snabe , deputy chairman of the board of directors of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who are not able to answer it a year ago – she says : where will my data be stored and can guarantee it , ” .
many german corporate leaders believe that the eu ’ s recent reports simply confirm what they call “ a new era ” anyway .
the fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise .
that was always the case .
“ it was many years a topic and has evolved through the current discussion .
americans are spying us on commercial grounds and in industrial terms .
the management of the company usually does not boast about the countermeasures taken .
in large companies , employees have long been born .
ulrich hackenberk , ceo of autohersteller audi , says that since years there has been a standard practice , a predecessor of the executive board , gathering mobile phones to discuss them as a stopping device .
the german bvt is advising managers to make simple prepaid handsets .
the prepaid card is a standard way to get your mobile phone back .
there is , however , a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises are vulnerable to hatred and corruption .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niche .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and the financial resources to be able to effectively combat unauthorized access to business secrets ” , explains the bbc .
the us warns its own firms of economic espionage by other countries .
according to washington post , in the us national intelligence institute , the number of people who are victims of terrorism was estimated to be at about two per cent behind china in february .

instead , they are convinced that the truth will be shrouded in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .
“ your son went to study in school and came to the corpse of the body , ” commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
the declared moore at a press conference on thursday afternoon was .
i follow the facts , in which direction you are heading .
my aim is to make the truth known .
“ i represent the view that the most important thing is that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .
moore explained to reporters that the initial response to the autopsy was that the “ johnson ” was not interested in the consequences of a “ position-based suffocation . ”
a second autopsy , however , has another cause of death , such as moore .
“ there is a series of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
moore added that the debian project has sufficient evidence to support a criminal investigation .
a representative of the county council , sheriffs , was waiting for our enquiry on thursday , not immediately to comment .
a court in the south of georgia ordered the release of the first official release on wednesday .

cdc publish allergy-related guidelines for schools and other institutions .
on wednesday , the european commission &apos;s centers-for disease control and prevention published a report on the situation of the disease in the united states .
these are the first such directives that we have adopted by the us government .
one in 20 children in the united states has now been allergic to food .
the spread of food allergies among children has increased , according to the cdc , by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are not yet registered with the teacher and the staff for food allergies .
it will also be recommended that schools use epinephrin in stock – the auto-inject is used to treat epipen .
the legislators in the states have recently adopted the rules that will allow schools to use epinephrin more easily .
the report also calls for a list of typical symptoms that are caused by children who have a allergic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels like a child , ” but it is not .
parents of intersexual children can “ sexually impaired ” by choosing “ sex indefinite ” .
germany is the first european nation to have a third nuclear gender .
newborn children are not born any more rigid male or female .
after the new law , parents do not have to pay for sex for such children , but can “ be indefinite ” or “ undefined ” on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to limit the pressure of parents to allow them to avoid rushing decisions in relation to operational matters for a gender perspective .
an intersexual person said , according to bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i maintain that patchwork , which is being used by doctors , is being mutilated and full of scars .
it is estimated that one in 2,000 children in europe die either as young or as girls every year .
they are among the intersexual , one group that is suffering the diagnosis of “ sexual difference ” .
valais simson was perhaps intersexual , but he was not able to speak .
understanding the gender dimension of the work is still not very good .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ klinge after good cause ” .
intersexual children are a moral problem .
&quot; some people have life-threatening illnesses that have a surgical influence on their condition , but for the majority of children , this does not apply , &quot; he said .
you can use a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the results to develop .
the scientific data on how a child is able to develop his or her gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret that why people are homosexual .
in a report to the european commission from 2000 , it says that intersexual violence is a threat to transsexuals or transgenic people .
these characteristics showed a great deal of interest in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , skin breasts and stature , primarily the sexual and emotional characteristics of the child .
the report also provides an overview of discrimination , discrimination against women and children in the workplace , and the discrimination against women in the workplace .
not with gender , but with the same level of education , a special camp now has .
in the meantime , it has become a popular activity in australia and nepal , but it is also possible to use official documents male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , australian norrie may-welby ( 52 ) was the first “ gender-free ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court ruled that lifelong maintenance of a “ undefined ” gender status .
german passports have a valid passport number and a third one , x for intersexuell , so the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring guatemala , gender issues are still controversial .
in 2011 , duty-free french members of the strictly catholic parliament signed a petition calling for the “ gender equality theory ” to be included in school books .
the us website catholic online has been dedicated to the german law .
the mother of a newborn from maryland explained to baby zone that she was going to find it better if babies were given a baby at birth .
“ the parent company ” is the only one who has no further restrictions .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were both born with male and female children were treated as victims of the violence .
just ten years ago , the european union ’ s medical system regarded gender as something that could be eliminated and rebuilt .
but now the ethical and ethical foundations of an operation are in doubt , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wrongly able because they are not aware of the impact of the child on growth .
&quot; in the middle of the 20th century , one called it psychiatric emergency &quot; , said drescher .
if such a child was born , then the child was not called to the psychiatrist , but to the surgeons .
the ruling theory of the treatment of children with unclear and ingrained genitals goes to dr. john money from the johns hopkins university , who founded the view that the child ’ s sex is formable .
he formed the term “ gender ” , which means that the gender dimension is not just a matter of social or environmental considerations – as parents have a child .
but in a country under the title “ john / joan ” , the us government ’ s “ no ” case was identified as controversial .
he called on parents of a young , whose penis was killed in a food security box .
money-presented this case as a successful example of a reversal , which he did not . ” , he says , “ it is a shame .
when the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male school of music and married him .
with 38 but he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who have not applied this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the arrival of the internet , surpluses of this gender identity were still on the public stage , and the “ unhappy with the outcome ” were .
for example , jim bruce , a 36 year-old author from montana , who was working with xy-male chromosomes , has been twice as confused genitals .
the doctors were aware that the problem was not whether they had a big klitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never become a “ satisfying life ” as a man .
so his external budget has been reduced and the hods were soon to be born in 1976 .
at the age of 12 , he received female hormones .
“ i knew that the world was not a girl , ” explained the minister of abcnews.com .
i was unfortunate , but i was not happy .
at the age of 18 he should be a vaginal plastic .
but , as he depresses and knew that he was not doing something , he was confused with the other .
what he found was a shocking picture of .
i was asked at my birth to be sterilised – and no one ever told me .
bruce was born in the united states and lives in the united states .
after he had learned the truth , he changed his way back to the male identity , and testosteron-injections and let himself be seized .
the operation has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organisation called interface project to help the interface to be accessible to intersexual people .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the company in california , has said that the us is not a member of the legal group .
“ many activists are concerned that the german decision to encourage parents to take rapid decisions , ” he said .
we fear that the favours interference .
we believe that it would be better to leave the male or female to the female sex .
but we still do not know how this law will affect , so we cannot do without speculation .
tamar mattis said that their organization supports the australian law , because “ it enables adults to use the term “ third sex ” to gain recognition .
“ adults should be able to learn their own decisions about their legal sex . ”
the german law is about the rights of the person who is born .
this is not a battle to which small children can be made to go at this time .
if you have grown up , you can decide yourself about your body .
but dr arlene baratz , a brustradiologist from pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual difference , has been arrested and is hundreds of other people in a self-help group .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was born with male children .
because of the receptor failure of the target cells for testosterone , katie developed female characteristics .
it has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .
today , katie 29 is married and has two children .
although it is infertile , it hopes that the adoption of or a slight surrogate mother will bring a child .
“ the law gives parents room to make use of it , and so they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” said baratz .
it provides you with the time to test various tests and to do things and gives you as much time as you need to “ be male ” or “ female ” .
in this way , everything is fine – you pull the baby out and love it .
we have a wonderful baby , and enjoy the feeling of having a parent .
and we do not need to rush into an operation that does not move away .
“ this includes the children in the decision , and eliminates the fear that they might be rewarding , because they think that their children are not going to do the right thing , ” she explained .
in the end , the child decides about the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .
this will make children able to use the internet to decide for themselves .
unknown publishers violate girls by shot from car .
unknown people have been killed in shots from a car for twelve years in saxony-anhalt .
the perpetrators had to leave on thursday evening in ghent with a compressed air force to a group of children .
the shared the police in burg with them .
the girl is easily at the left wade .
bailouts broke the girl into the hospital .
the shot came from a small car , which was on a group of six children .
witnesses saw two people in the car sitting .
the perpetrators also shook the bus station .
a disc crumbled .
then we went on .
the criminal police are investigating , saying that the crime was on friday .
by now , the commission &apos;s police inspection can only be carried out in a calm , halloween night .
the officials were only appointed twice , and the commission was not able to provide them with any information on the situation .
as the house owners do this in time and the eiergeest immediately distant , the house owner should not have suffered any damage .
furthermore , in the city area , some sylvesterböller were ignited , but also here is no factual damage .
an admirer in the bischof-friendorfer-weg reported that his car had been wrapped in a knob and his wheelchair apertures were removed .
by the arrival of the police , the man has left his wheeled apertures in the immediate vicinity all , so the police are not going to have to take further action .
living with future prospects for the future .
actually , waltraud ries lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with lots of green , a old tree population , nice rooms and a nice garden .
the city has a few metro stops , and the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; you hopefully have no fear of spiders ? &quot; , waltraud ries asks and points to a fat spinne on the door frame .
i am looking for a new version of apartment for my husband and me for some time .
but you know that the problem is in the case of stuttgart .
the reason is not a spinning phobia , but a concern to be able to overcome the many stairs to the house and the apartment at an age that explains why .
moreover , for a meniskus operation , the mittfiftier has been suffering from his own body what it means to deal with handicaps .
recently , the first book by her was the &quot; new york times &quot; , a book about &quot; happy living in the age &quot; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what happened in old age . &apos; , begins with a warm welcome .
when they were elected to the european parliament over 20 years ago , they were not allowed to stay in the apartment .
today , mid-fifty , waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
she knows , however , that she is one of the few people who have ever been involved in the subject of &apos; living in old &apos; .
most of them are obstructing it as long as it is possible .
the old age is only ever used for the others &apos; , she says schmunzelnd .
only when the passion for the work is really great will we be concerned .
&apos;then it can also be too late . &apos;
in her book , the interior designers of the hotel presented 17 models for a self-determined living in old age .
&apos;what form of living you choose , however , is always an individual decision &apos; , she explains .
d i e solution give it not for the age .
even if you are looking for retirement pension in tuscany or brittany , you will not be sure to consider whether you are also sick .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , unifying the language of the dolce vita , &apos; gives the expert authors the chance to find out who they are .
under their models you will find classic support models , which are alternative living forms or which are often quoted as pensioners &apos; association .
at the age of five , everyone has his ticks and makings and then mask them .
&apos;for me , such a community of flats would be nothing , &apos; she says with a wink .
it is not at all like a student wg with a common bath and a kitchen .
&apos;at age , you just need to take your back rooms &apos; , richard ries says .
that a senior citizen &apos;s residence is nevertheless able to function is something that the book author wants to avoid .
that must then be done differently .
and sometimes you just want to keep your calm , &apos; believes you .
with this opinion , it is at least in the capital of the country .
&apos;most old people in stumbling blocks want to stay there until they are in their own home &apos; , is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the capital .
your services are happy to advise people around the topic of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why older people in particular would often also experience inconvenience and restrictions .
there are still many possibilities here today to reconstruct the house or apartment without barriers .
he recommends that all users who are familiar with the age limit should use the new version of their home or apartment .
today , there are also new and more flexible solutions for the age-oriented conversion .
even in the rental apartment i leave the one or other realization , and if it is only the toilet facilities , then i will clarify the interior design .
but not always can the existing apartment be adapted to the age and therefore accessible .
this experience had to be shared by waltraud ries .
while it might be possible to have a stairlift inside the apartment , which is also covered with stairs , it is possible to walk to the apartment door .
it will continue to search until you find the ideal object for yourself and your husband .
before the move greys it &apos;s more than a week before the spinne on its housing .
the usa wants to continue to prosecute snowden .
the us has changed its position on the former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
i will continue to be accused of being illegally communicated information .
therefore , it must be in the us to agree to a criminal procedure , the spokesman of the us department of foreign affairs , jennifer psaki , in washington .
the recent statements by mr snowden would not change this either .
previously , the german green politician , hans-christian ströbele , had a clear message to the world ’ s leaders after a meeting with snowden in moscow that he should not continue to threaten him with punishment .
psaki emphasized that it is a process of fluid expression .
intelligence agencies are not edward snow , but they are in principle willing to talk to german authorities .
first he wants to improve his situation .
this is what the us has been seeking , and what the nsa ’ s former worker has said in a letter that is not addressed , which hans-christian ströbele sent to the us on friday after a meeting with snowden .
the letter has been sent to the united states after a street-widespread translation :
the competent authorities must be sent to the competent authorities to ensure that the relevant authorities are informed of the results of the relevant investigations .
i was asked to give you a clear answer regarding your mass monitoring inquiry .
i welcome edward joseph-snowden and i used to be a contractor or a direct job as a technical expert in the national security agency .
in my work in these institutions , i have seen systematic and systematic legislative violations of my government , which have forced me to stand up for action .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was faced with a serious and persistent sore , which forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in the exile and enjoy the best time of the year .
i am encouraged by the reactions of the committee on foreign affairs and the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .
citizens around the world and also high officials are being asked - including the united states - to pay attention to the revelations about a system of all-encompassing monitoring that does not hold anyone to account .
this spy policy is not only a source of proposals for new legislation , but also a source of inspiration for the new member states .
the benefits for society from these obtained knowledge are enormous .
although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is not dealing with the issue as a five-year loyalty and is seeking to make political expression criminalised and prosecuted .
nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the commission &apos;s government will continue to work with the international community to put an end to this abhorrent attitude .
i hope that i , when the difficulties of these humanitarian situations are resolved , will be able to make a commitment to the responsible use of this information .
i am looking forward to a meeting with you in your country , as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to respect international law , which is a matter of concern to all of us .
edward snowden was a witness to hans-christian schwarzenbele ’ s work .
kindergarten has found a private buyer .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the garden road has been connected to a private person .
the sale was approved by the municipal council in its recent meeting in the non-public section .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the municipality is satisfied &quot; , says maier .
in the budget , eur 100 000 was earmarked .
not yet clear what the council &apos;s new owner will be using the former kindergarten .
the mayor has the right to expect winterlingen to take responsibility for the building before winter to someone else .
&quot; this effort is now gone &quot; , is happy to maier .

report : obama campaign overlooked that biden by hilary clinton is a good way to get the world to work .
the closest advisers of president barack obama have , in secret , considered appointing vice-president joe biden in the 2012 election campaign by hillary clinton .
the revelation is the beacon of the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilmann about the 2012 election campaign , “ double down : gaza . ”
the times is a mere example of the demo of the upcoming release .
according to jonathan martin , national political correspondent , the times , the country ’ s book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house staff to promote the cause of the white house .
the potential change was a rigorous process , and the way in which the campaign was conducted in chiapas and the east pacific was a secret .
only half a dozen of the enlightened advisers of the president – including daliy , the former leader of obama ’ s campaign , jim messina , and the white house ’ s white house ’ s senior adviser , david axelrod and wright .
in double room , the room is said to have been left with the head of the effort to bring together biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship ” .
in an interview with martin , he confirmed that the european union is a real superpower .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that i would like to consider .
we must be aware that the european council president was horrific about the poll , so i thought we were saying : ‘ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ’
while daly was the &quot; commandment of care &quot; , he was said to the other son cooper of cnn , that during the campaign for the re-election of significant effort was carried out to ensure that the results were correct .
“ in campaigns , it is not so much money that is spent on surveys and focus groups when you are not seriously thinking about something , ” said martin on ac360 .
it is not clear , however , whether obama knew that he would be able to exchange intelligence , but he was not .
martin said that cnn , he thought daly was a good friend of his then boss .
although the commission has stated that it believes that the european union &apos;s president is not aware of the possible change , there was a clear message from the former chief of staff that it was “ possible ” for obama to be aware of it .
martin added that the debian project has a &quot; double down &quot; function .
cooper wondered why debian should be seriously thinking about obama having nothing to learn from the research about how to fix biden in the elections .
“ possible ” , replied martin .
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually electronic , but it is not .
was the commission not involved in designing internet service e-mail , as it is in conventional post , in technical terms ?
in the design of the early internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .
that is why the basic technical protocols did not ensure that a stable system of rules for the consultation was established .
therefore , a conventional method of e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; calls &quot; anna &quot; to &quot; benni &quot; a mail will be sent , the computers of the two then directly connected ?
the email program or browser of anna schickt in the first step to the mail-server of your service provider .
if you are looking for a gmail account , for example , google would be .
this mail server sends the contents to the provider .
on the track , the mail can be sent via many other servers on the internet .
bennie may then change the content to its provider .
are conventional and unsolicited e-mails on their way through the network ?
most macintosh mails are sent several times during the journey .
the provider of the sender will be able to check whether the sender &apos;s mail is a malicious attachment .
on the receiver systems , the receiver also uses a virus check .
we also check the availability of the service .
have the robots not yet done another task ?
for systems such as gmail , the robot also determines the information gmail has to place context sensitive messages .
if anna and benni are sent by gmail via their forthcoming holiday journey , the google site may provide relevant links to other holiday offers .
read also unknown people who read the emails ?
the probability that unauthorized persons are given a mail is increased .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrative tasks often have the possibility of sending electronic mail .
the criminal prosecution authorities and secret services have also established legal means of sending e-mails or of knowing whether they are .
in addition , there are possible illegal expulsions .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
with an encryption after the openpgp standard , an e-mail can be read effectively against reading .
with high technical effort , it is also possible to use the meta data of an e-mail communication , so that not even without further knowledge can be detected who is connected to whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the main private and commercial postal lines are the yahoo and google , according to a survey by convios consulting , which took place in august 2013 , only a minor role .
while the shares of yahoo mail last fell , the gmail server was able to clearly increase gmail .
mother in the forest is missing and renting cashed .
when his beta mother died , he wrote a book about the life of wolfsburg .
he also endured the dead in a forest - and cashed out their rents and nurtured their children .
to continue to provide pensions and care , the commission will pay a fee of eur 6.5 per year .
first of all , he was responsible for the death of the 89-year-old , then he spent more than a year and a half .
now the council of 67 years has to resign for fraud , as a spokesman said on friday .
so the commission hid the idea of women in a forest in the vicinity of helmstedt .
suspects are not the man who was arrested in may : at that time , he was found to have been arrested for the mother in need of care .
the investigation teams were told that the pensioners had lost their mother to spain .
because officials do not know this , they are told that they were not .
the result was that the two were in the process of being in a common flat for more than 15 years and he was last clean .
the 67-year-old finally died of his mother , and the mother died .
a patient &apos;s application showed that the police had no evidence of a capital crime .
want to eat ice cream , which is in the dark ?
a british businessman has the first in the dark .
charlie franciis made a commitment to fluorescent properties of sea ecology .
the idea came to him after he had a research work on quals .
the ice cream reacts to the skin when it is consumed , which makes the ph value in the protein rise and the light shining .
chris explains that the menu ice is not responsive to the heat of the mouth .
charlie , founder of the eiscremecum company “ lick me i &apos;m delight ” , has said : “ the product is incredible , very good , but still in a very early stage of production , and so you get two for two .
the hotel is located in the icecream , with the tongue at a neat , neutral ph value .
if the mouth is tasty , the protein is rising .
we are dealing with a very important issue in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to be at halloween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream that i ever made .
each ball costs me about 140pounds .
but for this , it tastes delicious .
charlie experimental music company with headquarters in bristol is famous for its excellent music and its excellent service .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to see an invisible ice cream ’ .
this is in itself a impossible situation because of the light that is being shed by the ice crystals .
the ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torment that is produced by chinese scientists .
the tsv morsum is still in the final stages after six days of play .
it is precisely now that the european team is facing a challenge for ingo ehler &apos;s team tomorrow .
with this game the season begins new for us .
&quot; i hope that we will finally get our head free &quot; , says the ehler &apos;s behaviour optimistic .
the commission has finally done something about this , with the exception of the long-injured hendrik blohme .
i also think that , as we have done , there is a tempo game .
therefore , we must increase our error rate .
first and foremost , we must be able to protect ourselves against the threat of terrorism , which has been the main reason for this .
the new version of the new version of the game is now available in english .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from the favourites , because in the derby everything can happen .
however , panditz is now seeking to prove in morsum that he has already started a series .
the first thing that jan-malte will miss is jodat .
for this , the a-teenager joost windsweß , who is playing with double play rights at the a-youth bundesliga hc bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .
anyone who is in such a game is not hot should be able to stay at home .
halloween 2013 : in figures for the first time in figures , the number of people who have been in the past in figures for the past year in figures for the past year , in figures for the past year , the number of people who have been in the number one in the world is still in the most of the number one in the world .
when i was small , halloween had something to do with magic .
my sister and i were allowed to sweets , eat late , stay up and take care of our neighbour .
today i am more interested in halloween muffle .
in recent two years , i have not been prepared to make use of my apartment to sweep things .
but , according to statistics , i am a black sheep , which is halloween .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating the halloween this year and giving a total of 6.9 billion dollars for southern europe .
one thing i would like to focus on every halloween then after all , are the trends in the game .
the costumes are made about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion spent us dollars .
in this year , exciting events are taking place in the city &apos;s last cry .
women must not be forced to move to sexy clothes anymore , they can now be seductive food like pizza , hamburger or carrots .
what men are looking for , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft-punk space series will be a great success this year .
according to google , the most requested information is the &quot; zombie &quot; , batman , pirates and witches .
i suspect that it is not wrong to go on .
we have already had our dutch dog show last year and we have been very surprised to hear that .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , so the nrf .
these are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .
as far as sweets are concerned , we are not just a bit timid .
americans will be spending $ 1.9 billion this year to help , the nielsen company says .
these are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , which is luckily , bonbon and rubber .
so good news for the us trade ministry 41 million people , who are living with the sweetened or acidic word by the neighborhoods .
indeed , we will have more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and , let us not deceive ourselves , eat .
the only thing we do not consume is to buy sugar .
these are about eur 9 billion of maize producers .
it is a mystery that we must not yet resolve .
nothing more belongs to halloween than houses , in which there are sputs .
you have done some great names such as “ terror behind us ” , “ the people ” , and “ the people ” .
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognised spukhouses in the united states , which provide 500 million dollars to pay for the construction of america haunts , and that includes the wonderful world of photos , on which you can find yourself in the city .
but let us finally come to the shorbis .
charlie brown , a young man , made us a lot of familiar with the great cupboards we were children , and the cutting of a shorter version is like the decorating of the christmas tree – something we know from little to little .
fortunately , the “ baby boom ” began to be a trend only last year .
this year , americans will spend around $ 106 million on shorthair , so the us census bureau estimates .
the shortest bislaterals , which are slowly rotated in the front garden , are presumably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of shorter crowns were harvested .
if you have a question , please call us .
housing is a fire in helmbrechts : rescue forces are bringing in boiled corpses of corpses .
the fire brigade had to leave the room late on thursday evening in helmbrecht .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins in the night for friday fire .
the rescue packages are still in danger of being buried in the open house .
bailouts have helped to save the lives of millions of people in a fire in helmbrecht .
whether it is a resident , a person is still unclear how a speaker of the police in bayreuth said .
in the late thursday evening , i had a meeting at the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade entered , the soldiers of the fire struck out of a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the body in a room .
this and another room is burned completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were killed during the fire .
the building was not built for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .
germany ’ s largest national church has an offensive structure , which is designed to provide a better job for the pastor ’ s profession .
the background is a possible parish plan , which is that the gospel lutheran church of the country hannover researches the extent to which the number of its current approximately 1,800 pastoralists and pastors is increasing .
for young people from today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to see the working and daily routine itself .
with burfien , the state church of st. john has for the first time established a pastor at a full place to appoint young people for theology studies .
at the moment , fewer and fewer young people are deciding on the basis of their abitur , theology .
burfien is doing this in the process of decarmonization : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loud &quot; .
it is important to note that the profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and can be my focus there .
pastors could be regarded as a pastoral caretaker very close to the people .
it earned the reputation of being a teacher and could well live on it .
i am sure that free economy will pay more , but that is what theologians would have a safe employer .
this is a benefit to young people today who are unable to cope with not only their careers but also their own indulgence .
according to the national church of the united states , which has three quarters of niedersachsen , around 60 pastors are currently retiring .
at the same time , about 40 graduates from a theology studies are starting to develop their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin , emsland and wendland , the situation could become difficult in the future to occupy .
burfien wants to study at the university of new york , among others , and to attract prominent students to attend the theology .
the theology studies offer you a broad education .
you can even use it to become president of the federal republic .
land rover rally series announced the launch of the new version of the land rover rally series .
in the interior you will find racing seats and six-point slides .
the options range from enhanced braking to more flexible service packages , and support for bowler machines to more flexible and flexible braking systems .
drew bowler , managing director of bowler motorsport , explains : “ the rally championship customers , who are part of bowler , have decided to change . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for a new experience .
we are pleased to continue along this path in partnership with land rover and msa .
we really enjoyed working with the demo and the new version of the game .
in addition , there are many other problems with the defender challenge .
fire brigade to rescue a bitch .
cockerspaniard bitch ruby was born after a minor road accident .
three days later , she was taken by a walker in the quarry in her precarious location .
fire brigades rolled to rocks and the fire salted the dogs .
the fire brigade managed to create a female , who was in a safe state , on a 15-metre lead in a rocky wall .
the nine months old cockerspaniel bitch ruby was born after a road accident on sunday afternoon .
scott alderson , 25 , and his friend , will be happy to help you with the new album .
they promised desperate for their desperation .
about 14 : 15 pm on wednesday , the first day of walking was a little late .
the technical rescue package is a part of the cleckheaton fire station , which was designed to provide a safe and secure environment for the rescue of rubys who were then in a hundebox .
andy clayton , specialist in technical rehabilitation , has been working on the basis of the latest technology , saying : “ she was in a dangerous position .
it was in the hands of the rocks and was 15 meters from the top and the bottom .
they moved no boldly , while they were rescuing – they were like stiff frogs .
but now we are going to do it well .
it then adopted a few dog owners , who were not allowed to leave the dog .
that was a rather unusual step .
the fact that the hound is discovered is a incredible result .
peter lau , specialist in technical rehabilitation , has been working on the basis of the latest technology , saying : “ ruby had a huge disaster . ”
there was the possibility that they could be seriously injured or worse .
ruby was used as a veterinary surgeon , but it was not used in any other way than exhaustion and dehydration .
becky hall , from halifax , west yorkshire , said : “ at the rescue of zul &apos;ezra , it was frightening . ”
i could not believe that the commission really was up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the poor .
animal doctor explained that if the detection of the depletion has become too great and had broken down , it would probably have crashed .
the fire brigades have done a great job .
it was really courageous what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of you was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keighley added that the debian project is currently in a state of fear of falling down , but she remained at the top .
the fire brigades were great .
i can hardly believe where they were .
mick jagger explains that he has been using kay perry as her eighteen .
in an interview with a australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had a background record in the uk as a background singer .
perry explained that she had been working with the altrocker to evening , and that “ he asked me to sit down when i was 18 ” .
they added that the “ the only way to achieve this is to have a good time ” .
in a statement , a representative of hunters said , 70 , on thursday , that he said ‘ categorically ‘ no ’ that he had ever attempted to bring katy perry closer to him ’ .
the representative added : “ perhaps the commission has taken him with someone else , but i am not sure whether he will . ”
perry was one of the singers who played at the rolling string quartet .
your new album “ prism ” will be released on the first day of the year in the category 1 this week .
george kerevan : european enthusiasm for the creation of a european union is a choice for the scots .
a new day , a new terrible story for independence .
this time we will be warned that a more independent scotland would be needed .
this provides the sample of the history of the passport controls in berwick and a list of the most important documents of the german state .
in fact , in the stratcare world , the report refers to the potential economic benefits that could be gained by more freedom of movement in the rest of europe , but this did not , as expected , play into the headlines .
the fact that the commission has not yet agreed on a common position on the subject is also something that nobody has mentioned .
as scotland is currently not part of the schengen area , it would be a serious mistake to continue to ignore brussels .
so really no story .
and one that has been in the years already , and that is that you have already been gliding like a fossil : for the first time i have seen the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .
this is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient story .
why not talk about an independent scotland ?
why the london agreement ?
these are the real european news .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties are gaining ground , eu enemies are or are threatening the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could support alternative for germany – only this year – barely five million votes at the bundestag election in september .
there have always been domestic resistance to the plan , a federal europe , which is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
the current economic crisis , however , is turning out to be a turning point .
due to the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s strict monetary policy , the european central bank has been forced to make cuts in the straitjacket to which the national economy is bound by keeping to the single currency .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments being excessive .
instead , the eurosystem has been pushing its members to exchange rates that are too high for german exporters .
without the possibility of devaluing local currency , southern europe will find itself with a built-in productivity growth disadvantage compared with germany .
the only way to do this is to pay and public spending .
behind the current etat and currencies problems , there is a deep shift in european productivity .
as a result of the brussels regulation on ‘ green ’ energy taxes , which is a code for subsidising energy production in france and germany , the eu is now in a position to pay a heavy price compared with the united states .
this is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in grangemouth .
all wage fixing by the world protects the european petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap american oil .
as a result , a revolt is rising , especially in france , the former chief eric of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france looked at the eu as a vehicle for the eu to take action against germany in a bid to save paris on an equal footing with washington .
but berlin needs not be more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and europe has abandoned its own economic policy , which has undermined the french economy .
the result : marine le pens right-wing , anti-spyware , anti-european front has just launched a decisive campaign to win the battle for the socialist party .
the national front is now the most popular party in france with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning for the british labour government .
what makes le pen so special with its newly won popularity among the white french ?
it wants to support the eu elections next year to set up an anti-eu , anti-community currency bloc in the european parliament .
if anti-eu parties are not represented well in these elections – and that is very good – then they will be able to hold such a bloc for the first time .
this is the point i want to make .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) states ” .
germany and a few of its satellite economies may be holding fast to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to exchange their own currencies .
i expect the commission to take a stand on this project in the hope that it will be able to join the united states .
however , washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that the us should be alone in the atlantic ocean .
where is scotland ?
we can decide to create a region of ( lately ) small islands , and to do so with a small england .
or we can put our own economic interests – for which we are also in the midst of saying what berlin and brussels are capable of doing .
i suspect that scotland is in a better position to be a loser european union .
cooperation with other , similarly conceivable countries is essential in a non-federated europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider making it easier for norway to do the same and maintaining our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland has been a great success – remarkable for the last two years .
it would be a great pity for scotland to be in favour of independence now , just to be able to benefit from berlin and brussels in order to have a policy of austerity imposed .
early puberity : faster eruption of the disease .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach the puberity rather than their white age genosis , as studies show .
physical changes mean that the body is not directly affected by the puberty .
there is no evidence that the european union is using hormones or other chemicals .
experts believe that epidemic fat is the most common cause of death .
the trend towards early puberity is less pronounced in young people , and the fact that they are not so young is less pronounced in young people .
the former cnn correspondent , who was a member of the european parliament , is a journalist who has focused on child health and family issues .
if a mother is concerned when her daughter is already in the age of seven or eight , she will be breastfeeding and shamhairs ?
in the annual conference of the nursery association american medical association , the children ’ s association of pediatrics this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrinologist dr. paul kaplov declared this week .
“ i spend my time in building a new home for parents , ” usually it is not a sign that they are now quickly getting the pubery , ” explains the director of kaplowitz .
obvious defects in the design , such as the growing breasts , chimneys and axle hair and body odors , show themselves in girls sooner .
however , there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarche ( occurrence of the first regression ) in the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the child is 12.5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .
“ if the development of breasts begins , it will take at least two to three years to get to the menarche ” , said kaplowitz , author of the book “ early puberty at girls : the essential guide ” .
time is the most exact test , as the buffer is progressing .
it is controversial that the commission should actually begin to act as a putative but it is important to “ early eggs ” when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost a year ago from an age of eight .
in most cases , the process slowes , and the process is stagnating – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .
with faster response time , the us could be able to implement tests with endicrolled results in a more serious way , such as tumors or cysts .
there are treatment methods for delaying a early menstruation and the abwickering of another consequence : the early disappearance of the bone .
the recommendations for a medicinal treatment or hormonal therapy are based on the principle of age of the child , development speed , age of growth and the emotional condition of maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is cautious about medications , but it is not giving up : “ the subjugation of the puberty can cause behavioural problems and the emotions of girls , unlike their age genosis . ”
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ they worry about the fluctuation risk or about the way they treat the hygiene and hygiene side , ” said kaplowitz .
“ it was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter , with ten , had to spend their days .
even if there are initial signs and we are talking about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .
she came frighteningly to the point of being excited from school , because she had to be the first in her friend circle .
there are many fully published articles , but there are also many more .
but there are no conclusive evidence that the us is not a hormone-producing country in milk or other food , chemicals , and even in food .
young people come to the european union in the same way as girls .
kaplowitz believes that the persuasive premise of the “ epidemic of fetal disease ” is that it is the disease that is most convincing .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls in the age of six to nine years , which established a connection between body fat and entering the puberity .
other studies support this conclusion .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age genosis .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty of all kinds seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .
another mystery is that , although young people have the facial and shameless hair earlier , they are still more likely to become full-grown .
other doctors on the aap conference have stressed the complexity of the problem .
the emergence of acne and shamhaar is a problem even in babies and infants .
“ we must be careful to see how we are going to begin the true beginning of puberty , ” said dr. lawrence silverman , a paediatric endocrine ologist at goryeb chilung .
parents should not hesitate to contact their parents for advice on how to treat their children .
“ this may mean that you can use the same phone sooner than expected , ” said kaplowitz .
if you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who are injured early need the insurance to leave the process a normal life .
jumbo-manufacturer strikes in the face of big orders over seat width and height .
there are no differences between leading aircraft manufacturers .
the dispute is about whether or not to have a seat , the passengers with long flights , in the tourist industry , who are being offered a seat , not always those who are concerned most about making the most of the stated space .
airbus requested a study this week , which will be presented to the industry with a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class .
the debate is coming to an end at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are struggling to make even greater versions of their two-engine aircraft long-haul flies .
as the rear part of the aircraft is designed , the aircraft will be equipped with a series of nine or ten seats , and will be used to determine the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” system will deliver .
boeing claims that its modernised “ 777 ” fleet is fast-406 people at seated in the tourist class , which has more than 17 inches wide .
airbus explains that the bankruptcy version of the a350 is carrying 350 passengers in 18 inch widths in the tourist industry .
aircraft giant , the largest in the world , often means technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press .
now the company is appealing to the dubai airshow where the 777x will be delivered with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company presented an advertisement that was the beginning of a new advertising war .
“ boeing is slow to hit , ” says the german ceo , airbus president and ceo , and he is the first to say that boeing is a long-range commercial partner .
given the change in food habits , the people will be thicker , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 was the modern langstrückenreitung , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average man was between 40 and 49 years by 10 % .
the waist range of the male average is about 50 % .
airbus says that its rivals are still in line with a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly driven aircraft was about to exceed the average .
i have said that airbus has carried out studies that show that the number of passengers travelling by air is an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat .
boeing is denying the figures from airbus , at the same time as saying that it is not in the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines should use the balance between airlines .
the company also declares , according to studies , that the experience hangs on the aircraft from more than the width of the seat .
“ it really amounts to being able to offer airlines flexibility , so that they can do what they want to do .
you do not want us to discredit you with what you can make profitable .
you know your business better than any other .
for passengers , it is about more ellenbow freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be about a matter that is not just about the turnover .
behind the dispute lies a race for aircraft manufacturers , with a valued volume of at least $ 700 billion after listing prices in the coming decades , which is reflected in a sustained increase in the us or europe &apos;s export record .
how reuters , for the first time in july , reported that the layout is the driving force behind the confrontation over the new jets .
both airbus and the boeing 747 claim that they have more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment .
the statements by boeing on the results are partly dependent on the fact that the 777x with its ten seats per row is equipped with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs of each unit are always higher than the costs of the current machines with ten seats per row .
“ boeing quetscht therefore has more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive .
on the other hand , analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicate that the majority of passengers would choose the closer approach .
“ eighteen months of customs ” , the first time i had a flight in the united states , i was in the business for a while , but the reality is that the airbus offer is far from being a threat . ”
airbus and boeing are offering no seats in the world , but a catalogue of suppliers .
the world travelers jet sellers carry even bandwidth .
even if you want to enjoy the comfort , the hotel offers all the manufacturers jets with high compression air conditioning .
airbus offers a a350 with ten seat capacity , a fleet of more than 2,000 aircraft , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus has stressed that it is important to have more adaptability of cabins and to have broad seats for some jets on the corridors .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of great modern jet , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to be squeezed out , but the wave of 777x sales is distracting .
new anti-nicotine vaccine for the disease could help to escape the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have launched an anti-nicotine vaccine to prevent the spread of cancer .
a single dose of vaccine is not yet available to mice for a lifetime .
before testing on humans , other tests are needed to test the system , which may take some years , but professor ronald crystal has been awarded the gold cornell medical college award in new york .
“ we are very hopeful that the new version of this vaccination strategy will once again bring millions of smokers to the streets to stop smoking and thereby protect all the drugs available on the market .
the new vaccine contains a harsh , viral infection that has been modified to reduce the genetic information needed to produce nicotine .
the virus infected selectively the lever cells , the cells then have a constant stream of antibodies .
the antibodies are jam the nikotin molecules , in the blood and neutralize the molecules before they reach the brain .
in experiments , vaccinated monks kept their cattle and eggs .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ break out ” , the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine would not reach your brain .
the experiments are in the science journal of translation studies ( f.i.l.a.
previous tobacco imports from the eu , however , failed because they were antibodies .
vaccination is needed to maintain the level of antibodies in the european union as often as possible , and it is expensive and unpractical .
but the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower than the cost of the new vaccine , which transforms liver cells into antibodies .
as professor clinton said , the european union could be a major source of vaccine for people who are certainly not aware of children .
more likely , however , is that smokers would use it to stop .
“ you know then : if you start again to smoke , you feel a sense of insecurity because of the nicotine vaccine .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .
tripodi does not deny that opides influenced the way they were .
the former minister of labour , mr kaczyński , from new south africa , has been accused of investigating the situation of corruption .
former nsw minister bequeathed that the maritime safety regulations were not being applied at the request of his political mentor eddie obeid , who promised to remove the hidden participation in three land areas .
the index family of the deutsche börse group is a member of the german association of independent research institutes ( icac ) .
now , because of the accusation that tripodi has been taken by obeid &apos;s hidden interest in the land , it has been discovered that tripodis has been supplying former deputy chief of staff lynne ashne ashne aamne aamir .
in years of experience in talks with the chinese authorities , the commission and the european parliament , the government had been waiting for public tenders for leased contracts .
the pedagogues were opposed to this and wanted to keep them in a longer period .
in 2009 , the lease contracts for the companies were signed at the circuit quay , which is the annual equivalent of 2.5 million dollars .
tripodi , which was held from february 2006 to november 2009 port minister , initially opted for public tenders .
but he was stuck , the changes were made at the request of obeid , who , like tripodi , confirmed that he had to wait for a change in the lease arrangements of the government .
one of the icac &apos;s telephony reports was made available in august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a senior official who was sent to the port ministry .
“ was this the case in these telephone conversations ?
“ no ” , he replied , “ no ” .
i can &apos;t remember how the people who were talking were , but that was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighters are not allowed to attack target in syria .
israeli hunting aircraft would have been allowed to fly on thursday night in the syrian port of latakia , but confirmed a senior government official to fox news .
the official explained that he had no idea what the goal was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associate press , this was a case of a russian sa 125-rcvs .
at least twice israel has this year already taken airstrikes on missile supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 457-visas could be “ genuine test-” – and the us would be forced to accept a “ genuine test ” to help them .
the government is thinking in the context of enhanced measures on a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457-visa .
if the test is introduced , it would be possible to have a criterion that is not to allow the system to be used to cover the occupation of unskilled jobs or to be used as a back door for the access of family and friends to australia .
today , a discussion proposal by the government was published after the previous member of the laboratory commission had been arrested for the death of maxine mckew .
“ silent explanations like , exotic , should go back . ”
historically , it was called the “ soft power ” that was protected .
the discussion proposal revolves around twelve measures which were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chris bowen .
immigration ministers are not only the first to speak in the european parliament , but also the second most important to the european union .
if the “ real ” crisis is not resolved , the “ real ” criterion could be imposed on someone who is requesting a visa to check whether “ the application is valid in cases where the visa is issued ” .
companies could also be obliged to provide an account of the number of 457 visa holders in the eu , after the united states and japan have been forced to accept only a small number of workers in the past .
meanwhile , the world ’ s largest producer of sri lankan asylum-seekers probably died of heart attack , after having discovered a heart attack this week .
the disturbing neun-year-old son of the man who was with him to australia , is being held in prison since the death of his father on wednesday .
australian authorities brought the man to the christian people &apos;s land , and the british government was stationed in the hospital .
from the british government , a study has been announced which will examine the benefits of the hs2 rail project for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd , it is proposed to start a new project in the year 2026 , with the beginning of phase 1 , between scotland and the north of england .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed line line , which connects london and the west midlands .
after completing phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the commission &apos;s government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between london and nordengland from eur 32.7 billion to eur 42.6 billion .
the british government , which has been very active in talks with transport scotland , has banned hs2 ltd from entering into further flights .
this includes the possibility of a travel time of at least three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : “ our goal for hs2 is a truly national route network , which will bring great britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are going to the next step with hs2 because there are enormous advantages .
without the support of the european union , we are facing a crisis in capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about linking 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which , thanks to hs2 , are being improved .
the scottish secretary of state , mr alistair carmichael , commented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown has called on the scottish government to “ unequivocally ” support scottish involvement in the hs2 network .
brown said : “ the high speed internet is a great opportunity for people to make use of the potential of huge economic benefits for scotland , but at the same time , the scottish economy is also an argument for fast rail links throughout the uk . ”
that is why we are pleased to be able to work as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and will make the glasgow edinburgh link complementary .
i am looking forward to the committee of inquiry &apos;s report with the british ministers next year .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in australia .
australian passengers are required to continue to buy tablets and smartphones at the start and landing .
the us federal reserve board of directors has decided to renew its us air force aircraft fleet to meet its new requirements , so that passengers can fly on their equipment during critical flight phases .
during the great part of the flight , passengers are allowed to do so , but there are many people who find it irritating that they are not allowed to use their e-books when they start and land .
australian companies are watching the decision to contribute to its implementation by the us airlines with a huge amount of work .
the air traffic control agency casa explained that it was going to look at the announcement that it would be taking action , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in australia still apply .
“ the casa has a lot of specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , he said .
the subject is subject to provisions that state that airlines must always maintain safety and provide passengers with the information required by cabin crew .
virgin has already started to build up a new partnership with casa to expand its wi-fi network of entertainment .
“ we would like to see a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , because we are convinced that this is the customer experience that would improve after we have ( wireless ) installed the new system during the flight .
qantas explained that they will be able to stay at the current rules until further notice .
“ our current directives provide that the electronic equipment may be used at start-up and landing , and we have no control plans at the moment to change that , ” said the company .
the faa rules apply to us airlines that operate in the united states .
we are still interested in developments in regulations , which are of benefit to passengers , and we will be aware of the faa decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision has an impact on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
you must prove that you have purchased the radio interference from mobile devices and that you have the right to use manuals , training materials , hand luggage programmes and customer instruction .
“ after a airline has achieved tolerance of its fleet , the company can offer passengers a wide range of services that are portable , easy to use , such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones in any height ” , said .
in rare cases , when the camera is not in sight , the crew will instruct the passengers , while the equipment is being turned off .
the group recommended that the commission should be able to use heavier equipment at start-up and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seat .
before the resort you will find a lot of fun and entertainment .
borussia dortmund announced a new version of the debian gnu / linux distribution .
before the friday match , the football team of the bundesliga against the vfb stuttgart reacted by the ultras with a silence - initially .
it was an unfamiliar , almost already confused , acoustics that had been conceived to the viewer until just before the anchor of the bundesliga match between the german vice champion borussia dortmund and vaud vaud vaud vaud vaud vaud .
to hear were mostly the guest fans with their healthy singers .
the south gallery is a great place to meet the most loyal guests of the faithful and loudest bvb fans .
the podium of the capo , which otherwise would be the joint moisture , remained unfinished .
and , at the very front of the gallery , i was alone in crying a big flag with a title &quot; section stadium prohibition &quot; .
only as a goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always as the first bvb player to take the place , short-term jubilation broke up .
when his team colleagues followed , he gave a loud voice to the audience and crying scarves - but not everywhere .
in the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the south grandstand revolt nothing .
also , stadion spokesman norbert dickel has again confirmed the positive experiences of recent days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , contract renewal of trainer jürgen klopp - and did not worry .
only five minutes before the start of the game , the player &apos;s capo erkloses his podium - and the hitherto almost with hands .
finally , i was , as always , the south gallery on the list - and finally here was again as usual the laughing place in the stadium .
and at the latest when the first european union ministerial meeting was held with anpfiff from the south gallery , the loudly proclaimed &quot; derbysieger stands on &quot; was all over again .
the silence previously was probably a reaction to the events of 11 september .
just before the revierderby turn left at fc schalke 04 some of the fellow travelers bvb trailers had entered the spectators and on the square .
the game was played because of the chaotic scenes late .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the tips of the dortmund ultras daring to be in his office - and believes he was a little more than a mate .
&quot; it will be a great success for the whole ultrasound movement &quot; , says the director of bvb boss on thursday evening .
as a rapid response , watzke prohibited ultras from choreography for the home match against the vfb stuttgart .

pfandhäuser booms in singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has come to an end .
in a pfandhaus in the bendmeer shopping centre in singapore , janani amirthalinga is exchanging a golden armreif , a ring and a few earrings to keep the school fees .
“ my husband and i have just built a house that is in my hands .
although you are receiving 3,000 singapore flights every month ( ca 1,730 euros ) as administrative assistant , you are entitled to receive work from your husband , and the monthly family income is not enough , explains them .
indeed , demand in parts of south-east asia – where the debt of the us and europe ’ s households is increasing – is so large that valuemax , where it has exchanged , has this week taken the third pfandbrief .
the food and beverage / service is not only a quick way to make money , but also a way to get 1,300 singapore dollars in the case of janani amirthalinga .
typically , the pfandhaus in singapore requires an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , which is barely above the 15.4 % that the united states owes to the bank .
pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no verification of creditworthiness or income evidence , which is why loans are made faster than banks are possible .
for this reason , millions of people in the region turn to pfandhäuser after families have been forced to pay for their housing and their household and consumer debt increase .
after five years of robust growth for the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies , the families with low income families are seeking pfandhouses to finance their future .
this week , the rating agency called it standard &amp; poor ’ s .
malaysia , thailand and singapore have returned to their national currencies in the agency ’ s assessment .
malaysia is the largest country in the world , accounting for 80 % of gdp , and 60 % in 2008 .
economic operators are concerned about the economic crisis , as well as the high level of consumer debt in thailand , which is almost a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export-guard and a downturn in consumer demand .
“ in the end , this means that the need for a new , more efficient and more efficient service is felt by the people of the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) .
historical highs in gold prices in the last two years have hit the trend towards depreciating the personal capital of the country , as the people have the opportunity to buy the jewelry of the family in cash .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 pfandhouses of the city state gold .
people say that the eu is a “ gold price ” , but let us make a big difference .
the largest thai parcel service operator , easymony , has invested in its branches in a 20-percent share of its customers .
growth in the pfandbrief business is so strong that valuax , the operator of the branch in bendenmeer and 15 more in singapore , is not only involved in neighbouring malaysia .
the company finances the € 60 billion investment in the automotive industry , with 60 % of singapore ’ s dollars this week .
while some lenders are being forced to pay for high interest rates , others are saying that they will not be able to buy pfandhouses at lower interest rates than other lenders , but that they will not raise debt directly .
“ customers are selling items that they already own , and that is the liquid personality of value they are not adding to the household debt ” , explains the ceo .
the pfandleihs business is increasingly seen as a short-term , secure financing .
we are not all people who have pfandbrief banks , either , in financial difficulty .
rich people from singapore also come to fiji ’ s stores .
we have customers from all social classes , from all over the world .
“ this includes wealthy , the short-term , somewhat for a business or a investment .
sometimes you need to be very quick to make money .

the australian government insists on the tough conditions imposed by the rebate package .
federal health minister tanya plibersek has announced that the commonwealth will be the “ unconditional action ” to stop the disease .
the funding for a period of four years has been increased following consultations with the independent tasmanian member andrew wilkie .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package that will allow the country to recover its natural resources .
the 325 million-dollar war is a good example of the need to invest in emergency aid to the poor .
further 2600 operations are carried out , including orthopaedic operations and treatments for grey star .
in addition , there is money for day-clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare after stationary stays , and the fachharzbildung , services in the area of mental health and the introduction of an electronic health system .
“ these investments comply with the ideas that i have been told about in the clinic , they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , ” said dr. peter fitzgerald .
the minister was insisting on strict reporting requirements and on accountability .
the state should be the current financing level .
a three-person group of experts will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wilkie said today , the 325 million dollars would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms , which would make the public tasmanian health system more sustainable . ”
nevertheless , i praised the government for having been able to respond to its request for urgent help , which it had to give to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that we will be able to make a major contribution to the achievement of public health in the federal state from the sorrow list . ”
according to the government of the state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect recent cuts in the budget .
but the health sector spokesman of the opposition at the federal level , peter dutton , believes that the current announcement of a new government is only a “ plaster solution . ”
“ we are therefore able to offer our customers a wide range of products and services , ” says dr. peter schmidt , chairman of the board of directors of the german research foundation .
it is not acceptable that a government should be able to spend almost half a billion dollars on the system and that the commonwealth should be given eur 300 million .
dutton called for plibersek to guarantee that the system does not have one dollar of rescue .

syria has not lost its ability to produce chemical weapons .
syria has important institutions for producing weapons of mass destruction and chemical weapons .
also on thursday , the commission announced a syrian activist group that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war three years ago .
the announcement of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the date on the date of the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the date of the date of the date of the end of the end of the end of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the date of the ban .
january 1 - the first american war in iraq is declared a national war .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of the destruction , is a major milestone in an ambitious project .
the destruction of facilities means that syria and lebanon will not be using new chemical weapons .
damascus must , however , begin to use the weapons and supplies that exist .
assumptions suggest that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals in the country , and that includes senfgas and the nervous gas of sarin .
the announcement came to a time when the world bank struggles in the city of safira were taking place on thursday , experts say that there is a production facility here for chemical weapons and storage facilities .
the activists who are going to be working on a network of activists in syria to reduce the number of deaths , declared on thursday , 120.296 people died .
we have 61.067 civilian victims , including 6.365 children .
on the part of the government , 29.954 of them were part of president bashar assad &apos;s army , 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 lebanese hezbollah militias .
also among the dead are 2,202 depleted army soldiers , and 2,5375 battles of the opposition , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since march 2011 to 100,000 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has taken up about two million people to flee the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of whom have links to al-qaeda groups .
the observatory said that it was working on thursday to reduce losses on both sides , but it did not mention any details .
the fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors .
according to the opcw , which is closely linked to the united nations , the team is “ now convinced that it will all be supported by syria ’ s important production and mixing / filling facilities . ”
therefore , “ no further inspection plans are currently planned ” .
in the beginning of the week , the inspectors said they had ordered the first round of inspections and 21 out of 23 were in the position of damascus .
due to security concerns , the visit of two facilities was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc , the two sites were named &quot; syrian &quot; , according to syrian proposition , and the chemical weapons program objects there were transferred to other organisations named &quot; which were inspected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear whether the tribe in safira was one of the two institutions that had the opcw inspectors not visited .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons .
“ i prefer the dog to be the one who is brave and brave , ” he says .

the cause of the explosion is unknown , he explained .
zorn about judgement for bombers of bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 in the bombing in bali , are now being held in a very vulnerable position .
patek , who has been in the business for almost ten years as one of the most southeast asian people , has been arrested yesterday for his role in building spraying baskets .
criminal sanctions are likely to be lifted after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was accused of mass murder for which he was accused because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist resort of kronor .
a debtor was made in the same series of counter-terrorism attacks .
the prosecutor &apos;s office had a lifetime imprisonment , even if it was responsible for the man who was sentenced to death for his reputation as a master bomber .
the decision has painful consequences for the future of young core members .
tannins fought with the sword , saying patek had become the death sentenced .
i really think he should be in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; you should protect him from shooting , &quot; he said .
i must be very happy every day to have no more grandchildren .
the sari club was awarded the ground .
peter hughes was born in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a self-moratorium was found .
he fell to the ground after the attack for a month .
hughes said that patek had the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell yemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhi , and imam samudra – who were responsible for their actions .
really , this type should be used above all others .
to make it alive – no , it is not a reason to leave it alive .
20 years to get after he was in 202 people .
patek is the last of the bali bomber who was brought to justice .
it was taken away almost a decade from the arrest , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were deployed barely four months later on al-qaeda chief ohid .
during the negotiation , a fatah leader said that the government would be able to send the message that the government was not committed to the idea of patek in pakistan .
“ he has not asked himself , ” corteen said .
until recently , he did not have a reward for how much he would have inflicted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the ten-year anniversary of the attack in this year , which was marked with commemoration ceremonies in bali and australia .
“ it will be many tannins this year , ” said corteen .
patek can be held in reproach against his judgment .
faa : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft .
air passengers can now travel from the airport to the landing via the electronic equipment for reading , working , playing , listening to music and watching films .
but the passengers should not expect the airlines to make these changes immediately .
how quickly it is implemented depends on the number of people involved .
the airlines must be brought to the faa to prove that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they comply with the flight staff training manuals and the rules governing the stowage of equipment in accordance with the new rules .
the faa stated that it has already received information from some airlines that are not in favour of the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft .
in these airlines , the delta and jetro were also included .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could make the extended use of electronic equipment possible very soon , ” said faa in a announcement that it would be possible to use it .
at present , passengers must use smartphones , tablets and other devices to switch off when the aircraft doors are closed .
you may not use them again until you have completed a height of three kilometres .
when entering the country , the passengers must be informed of the departure time and not be forced to restart before the aircraft is landed .
after the new directives , airlines that have aircraft flying electronic disorders could be exempt from the obligation to provide passengers with equipment even when they are in the air , even when they are starting , landing and rolling .
most new traffic aircraft and other flying aircraft are in service for the use of wi-fi in larger heights .
laura glading , president of the association of professional professionals of flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glding .
we owe it frankly to be wary of being paralysed in this matter .
yet the internet connections to the surfing , exchange and other e-mails , text messages or downloading data have remained under three kilometres .
passengers are requested to provide smartphones , tablets , and other devices in the air mode .
so still no “ word ” is available .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed , as there is a risk of injury here if they are stolen by the cabin .
handy conversations during flight are also still prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the federal office of communications ( fpp ) .
faa highlights the possibility of banning certain electronic devices at start-up and landing on the market .
last month mark rosenker from the transport security agency said that the transport safety standards agency had been working on the implementation of the directive .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not just because they potentially are causing disruptions to navigation devices , but because we are affected by the fcc , that the transmission from the air is also transmitter masts . ”
a consulting committee is responsible for the development of the company .
in recent years , the market pressure has increased .
critics like the democratic senator , claire mccain , have been calling for the release of the new constitution .
the restrictions are also increasingly serious .
in some studies , the idea is that up to a third of passengers will be able to switch off the device .
the faa started its activities in 1966 , and the use of electronic equipment by air passengers was halted after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment were filed by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric equipment than on earlier models .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for a number of years , when the flight height is reached .
the data transmitted to wi-fi systems is encrypted and protected by a secure socket layer ( ssl ) .
the vast majority of the passengers are in favour of the strongest use of electronic equipment after the new directives .
today &apos;s electronic devices give generally much less radio radiation than the conventional ones .
e-reader , for example , only provide minimal radiation , if you use scrolls .
but when downloading or sending data , the transmission speed is higher .
the most advocates of relaxation of restrictions on the freedom of choice of equipment by passengers are the amateur radio stations .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited passengers to fly full of childhood e-reader and made a test flight , to experience problems .
members of the faa advisory committee are invited to express their mixed feelings about the outcome of the vote .
douglas kidd from the passenger association national association of the airline pacific ( nfc ) said that he thought the disturbance by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .
other comitee members said that there is no single reason for this .
the committee of the european parliament recommended that the faa should not be allowed to carry out any of its activities in the event of an instrument landing under poor visibility .
a group of the travel industry welcomes the initiative ’ s amendments and called them reasonable .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognises that a pleasant climate of passenger pleasure is not in contradiction with safety , ” said roger dow , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
by air , you can reach the city of northsea or geretteter by air rescue service .
a pouring pan service to the coast is available to the public .
the water purification was discussed with a helicopter last month to aberdeen .
colin seddon , head of the centre , said : “ this water rally was probably a winter migratory bird from northern europe , which was destroyed by the strong winds above the north sea .
it seems that the council of the devil was looking for refuge on the drill island .
he added that the “ he could not be further flying , so we were not happy with the request for help . ”
on your release , the water purification was back in shape and healthy .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of creating the economy at a table that would allow it to be defined by those who are in favour of prosperity and work in britain .
to this end , we have the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economists .
yougov bequeathed over 1,000 executives from the economy who had been in about the british size , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the commission &apos;s vast majority of member states have now been exported and exported to countries that are modernising and growing , while the member states in the eu are stagnating .
you want us to be able to speak out on the government side about new trade links with countries such as china , india and brazil , rather than dealing with the long and arduous process that is undermining obscure eu institutions .
in the question of your opinion on certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to the product legislation – the commission has taken the view that the european union should have control of these key competences in westminster .
there was general dissatisfaction with the proposal for a single market , as companies say that the costs of the brussels rules have now been outweighed by the advantages of being part of europe &apos;s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed .
finally , and this probably says most , the commission &apos;s reasoning was that the economic leaders who are responsible for the economic crisis were a clear majority of britain .
this is a recognition that has proved to be a reality for companies of all sizes and leading companies .
it is a question of a great deal – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 % in favour of the survival of the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the british economy is lagging behind its plan for the new negotiations of british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that the companies are facing a renegotiation of a clear shift in the balance of power back to the united kingdom .
a better defect for the british economy is possible and in increasing numbers .
the priority must be jobs and growth in the uk , as the result of our survey shows , what a stronger business focus is .
alexei miller from gazprom is a term for the pipeline in bulgaria , which is the beginning of a new gas era .
the construction of the south-stream pipeline is scheduled to begin in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the bulgarian section of the south stream pipeline is proceeding on a massive scale , the largest and most important project in europe , ” said the chairman of gazprom .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the entire european continent .
south stream is to be used to promote greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contractual dispute between gaza and the west bank is not a matter for the eu .
miller said that direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , meant that the european union , associated with transit countries , was not able to “ take off forever . ”
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream , which is at a discounted rate , when the entire project is put into operation in 2015 .
according to gazprom , the construction work in other subordinate countries is to be based on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is built on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

the german real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the european market &apos;s strong economic conditions .
this is what christian ulbrich , ceo of europa , pointed out in the middle east and africa of jones lang lasalle , at the 9th immobilientag of the stock exchange newspaper .
how do you search for german commercial real estate , i show the view on the transaction network and the fact that ulbrich is a real estate agent .
in the first three quarters of this year , it set a record low growth rate compared to the previous year .
in the uk , the plus was only 6 % , in france 19 % .
&quot; real estate investments offer an attractive marketing opportunity for investors &quot; , said ulbrich .
the return value of the investment between real estate and federal bonds is at an historically high level .

hearing before the royal assembly
two ymca employees from new south america and europe work together to develop a new and innovative strategy for the treatment of sexual crimes involving children .
but in the opening statement , before the commission , the ymca said that it was “ in the organization never with a pretext ” of sexual abuse .
managing director phillip hare was appointed to a case in which he was appointed a ymca employee for offences involving child pornography .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission &apos;s assisting lawyers , that he was being held hostage by the first case he knew of but the second was not aware of .
it acknowledged that the commission ’ s opening statement was a good one for the commission .
evidence of the commission shows that the commission &apos;s ymca is about to be established as a model for the second lowest valuation of four possible in a quality audit of the department .
harre , who was born with 21 at the ymca , acknowledged that the world ’ s management had “ been interested in downwards ” in the recruitment of lord .
lord was born in the beginning of the year in the city of london , on account of sexual offences committed by twelve young people during his two-year career .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
harre strung , however , stopped that the ymca was a cultural problem that employees knew about .
the staff said that they had infringed .
daniel oskwell , whose lecturer lord krugman was asked to attend a children &apos;s protection training , because she was not arrested because of his behaviour , said from what he said that the children &apos;s services were doing .
the managing director explained that he would not accept statements by employees that these would not be trusted .
instead , as he said , i have rather been following their friendship with lord for their judgement , which is why they should not have reported him .
harre explained that he has written to the board of the ymca nsw his opinion that the lexicon lessons are not the right lessons for the organization .
hare said that the decision to change the staff to sign secret contracts was a decision that was taken shortly after the accusations were made by the chief executive of the children &apos;s services of ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence .
the ymca nsw is able to be used in the time when jonathan lord lord was there between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained the need for a “ serious effort to address ” the recruitment , review , implementation , training , and supervision of the financial sector ’ s staff .
the hearing was held until 20 december .
tony blair stated that he would seize the opportunity to return as british prime minister – acknowledging that the british government ’ s comeback is unlikely .

the question of whether he would like to be appointed prime minister is a matter for the council .

howells told me : “ the whole audience was like electricity , and all have heard him moisten and complained .
he ran on sands the entire length of the arena and although he was so tiny , he was still able to get imaginative work .
fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses and is a tractor and farm .
just as he started , he will be unable to continue working until he is on the “ horse of the year ” show .
a spokesman for the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury will apply the finenton and toffee to determine how well they are .
they respect good cooperation between pony and leaders – and since they were funon and tomessy the best in the ring .
i am sure that the fenton ’ s sweet clothes will do their bit to make the most of what it was .

drug abuse is a disease with its own railway between the us and mexico .
one of the most refined and sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the us and mexico , completely equipped with lighting , fixtures and a wide range of electrical rails .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters of the tunnel as a huge disaster .
the tunnel , which was built in the zickzack pattern over a mere six football fields , is a combination of warehouses in the vicinity of tijulana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
in the area there are countless unspoilt warehouses , which makes it easier to work with drugs .
the tunnel is closed , and the drugs are undetected .
in discovering the tunnel , the two sides were struck by eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine , according to the court .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were arrested for having had and intending selling their cars .
they are threatened with a debit or a prison sentence .

the veganism is , according to the lexika , subject to vegetarianism , different from this yet in very significant ways .
for while vegetarians are looking forward to eating food from sahnetorte , ice or a vigorous edaly , they are facing bad weather .
milk , cheese , milk , milk , egg , besides the food and meat , the vegan leaves the vegan from all consumption of animal products .
what remains , however , one might ask , but when we look at it more closely , the vegan diet is characterised by a considerable ingenuity .
&quot; bread orders &quot; are not very popular , &quot; he explains .
also reuben proctor visits the store in the cathedral hall .
for 13 years , the native of neuzealand has lived in vegan , lampertheim ( almost ) everything is before him .
to celebrate the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; the conviction was not only expressed because of the diet , but also because of the choice of shoes , &quot; says proctor , the ordinary leather prefers normal leather .
he recognized that the only way to achieve this is to have a healthy and healthy lifestyle .
first and foremost , vegan is an ethic .
&quot; i do not want animals to be dying for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans who are based on the entire consumption behaviour .
instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bears , the european union has been working hard to ensure that the vegan is able to reproduce new products quickly and enthusiasm has increased .
&quot; it is a double bonus &quot; , says proctor today , &quot; in fact , vegan does not make up for giving , not taking ascese , but rather it is enriching &quot; .
and it is precisely this conditionality that has allowed some to be so well intentioned .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor , which many people can quickly give up , as in smoking , &quot; he explains .
and if one : &quot; certain tastes are not at the animal , &quot; he says .
often it is the spices or the way of ingredients that make the most of the flavour .
&quot; you can also count on other ways to achieve the same effect , &quot; explains the vegetation of the vegan .
at a barbecue , proctor , for example , brings aubergines , mushrooms and also some vegan sausages .
it takes care of a balanced , varied and healthy diet , in which it is possible to taste the delicious dishes .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but it is not .
health damage up to the level of eating disorders , another common assumption , he did not suffer .
for me , the changeover had a positive aspect .
i do not take any foreign cholesterol and i have an increased vitamin content .
there are high-performance machines , which are used in the field of vegan nutrition only .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i invite you to visit me often &quot; , says the author .
especially in the absence of vitamin b12 , many vegan simulation crystals warn .
&quot; as animals are fed with feed , i am not going to say that they are fed with feed , but that they are fed in the meat they eat .
for vegans , there is also the possibility of using the coenzyme in the form of tablets .
&quot; my b12-values are fine &quot; , explains he .
wide paths must be proctor for the food supply not to go .
basic food is available in all parts of the world and every supermarket has now produced soya milk and other products .
all you need is a computer with internet access .
only occasionally i buy something specific .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so they behave like that &quot; ordinary &quot; products .
in any case , the preparation of vegetable fats is much more beneficial and less time-consuming , than the usual .
&quot; in the house kitchen there is much to discover with a few small buttons , you can enjoy good , if not better results in part &quot; , says proctor .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of eggs , with its vegan cheeses , proctor could also surprise his sister parents .
family celebrations give the vegan a new dice .
this has dynamism , if you cook together , it has a new value .
&quot; the situations that are emerging are not so great that they are different from the people themselves , &quot; says proctor .
of course , he has been sceptical about this .
taste the delicious breakfast and enjoy the delicious food .
&quot; should i now get bad , because i drank milk ?
&quot; i reject the people of course , but i am part of this society , &quot; he would not like to become an enclave .
and , more precisely , everyday life appears to be less vegetarian than it is likely - and the vegetarian is not as divorced as it is commonly assumed .
almost food-free is also allowed .
pommes is also a popular place for all kinds of people !
&quot; many döner shops offer false alarms , but also the &quot; vegetarian &quot; .
in a pizzeria you can find a pasta dish from which you can order a pizza .
the restaurants are so slow to confront it .
&quot; when i was a member of the european parliament 13 years ago , i was very impressed with the way vegan was eating , &quot; says the new zealand .
&quot; if enough requests are received , they may be willing to give up the food .
vegane restaurants are developing as they are , for example , the combustion bushes in mannheim or the café vogelfrei .
proctor has the desire to make sure that other restaurants are also at least a vegan dish on the menu .
in fact , vegan food is a good choice for everyone .
everyone can eat them , they are just that opposite of exclusive food .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive and are not available in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , &quot; proctor states .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scandals , then vegetarianism is a safe way to avoid the vast majority of the incidents at the outset , &quot; says proctor .
the purchase of vegans products can , however , be a little difficult at the beginning .
especially if you understand how to use the same in oil and gas , you will learn to use animal additives as a colorful .
not only for this reason , reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients &quot; and their alternatives &quot; .
&quot; gradually , the new &quot; scanner &quot; look and the white color of which characters and logos you have to pay attention &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand up or to stumble &quot; , proctor knows .
the veganism , it is an important moral finger , and it is based on the consciousness .
perhaps he will not be able to make his habits clear .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s speculative bubble
the treasury has provided provisional funding for the cgt measure .
already , the us revenue from the steady increase in the amount of housing in the districts of westminster and kensington &amp; chelsea , which are the largest in the tax year 2012 / 13 , exceeds $ 708 million .
cook said : “ after the increases in the steady pace , on high-price initiatives , the us government has been pushing for a new approach to housing tax . ”
“ but this step could have a backward effect on some foreign investors , which would make buying property in london , or on ownership of it . ”
first class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market after the price – in the wealthy london market , southwest belt , which is surrounded by full swings and wimbledon .
the prices in central london were the same as in the united kingdom , with a steady annual growth of 5.6 % , but were not affected by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where south west london was the most important .
scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which the swing of a dog is related to its mood .
previous research has shown that the use of happy dogs is not compatible with the tail more than with the other dog ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs are not allowed to move the left side .
but now scientists say that other dogs are not going to use these subtle differences and respond to them .
professor georgio vallori , the director of the institute for neurology , has said that the world is not so good .
here we have tried to explain this to us in other species .
he noted that the debian project has a very good reputation for being a good dog , just like the human being .
to learn more about how to use dogs on the side menu , please contact us .
they were the heart rate of the four-legged breeder and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the council has decided to take a look at the one , sometimes in the other direction .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have the hurt films with dogs , but we have a natural or a very healthy version .
if the animals saw that they were being treated like an otherwise printable dog , they would be able to move the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the weaving dog ) .
but was the tail tendency predominantly after left ( again out of perspective of the dog , which wedelt ) , so the tail rose to a higher level and they saw unrest .
the commission is of the opinion that professor vallortigara communicates not intentionally with each other through these movements .
it is , in fact , convinced that the dogs have learned from experience , in which movements they are worried and when not .
he said : ‘ if you have met different people with other dogs and you have to wet with the tail into one direction rather with friendly behaviour , you will have to respect the right side a less friendly attitude . ’
the researchers say that the most important findings of hundeowner are the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers , which helps to better understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert on houndeweise and hospitality grants , has been involved in the faculty of animal health at the university of bristol .
last year , a team of the university of lincoln found out that dogs had to head to left to see if they had an aggressive dog .
in another research work on the university of victoria in canada , the following was the following : “ dogs are more likely to be robo-dog when it is , tail ‘ left ’ and not right , rather than restless .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore result in the fact that the dogs are the animals in the filming or the pipe pigs in the different studies not being interpreted as dogs .
a study , such as the way dogs are responsive to real dogs , could help him explain .
“ although there are significant evidence that the us has been mammals , the two brains have been responsible for different purposes , ” he said .
as your behaviour is simply unfolding , you will be likely to be unable to find out what you are doing .

pope francis xi appointed the president of the republic of china in february .
pope francis xi &apos;an will be elected for the first time on 22 february to new cardinals of the catholic church , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the ranks of the highest clerics in the catholic church after the pope and they are the ones who are to hold a pope , so that francis ’ s rule is the first group of men .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has an age of 80 can be considered a little more than a pope .
in a statement in which the message was announced , the commission president told us that the european union would not be able to speak with one voice on the vatican .
“ pope francis ’ s book has decided to make his decision to convene the consistent story of the february congress in advance .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the commission &apos;s number of eligible voters was over .
he explained that a pope appointed a new pope normally as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of voters could be reduced .
the consistency story is a little more than a year ago , because it is the first since the election of franziskus in march of this year , so valero .
at the moment , there is a certain overhang on the part of europe , and especially italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pact is a pope cardinal from the rest of the world .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of potatoes .
the cardinals are also used for the first to be built since the first cardinal of the church founded by franziskus .
in the past , the pope decided to do everything by itself .
“ now franziskus has taken these eight cardinals , which help him , ” said valero .
he explained that it is “ good possible ” that francis ’ s reign of cardinal for advice .
but , so far , we have not been able – all this is new .
valero said that the typical way to do this is to get the bishops out of big places to cardinal , but franziscus is “ full of surprises – we do not know whom to appoint . ”

desperate horror of an obama electorate
i have asked president obama twice in the hope that he will change .
he says that obama has praised the efforts of the united states to break the deadlock .
the blocking policy apologises not for the site problems of obamacare , the drone attacks , the attacks on the internet , and the intrusion of the internet .
obama ’ s memoirs of the election campaign in 2008 are a sad reminder of what happened .
nathaniel p. morris is a student at the second year of harvard medical university .
i read at the moment a terrible sad news picture .
it is a book that i have read of , and it would be a great pleasure to read during the dismal second year of my medical studies .
it is called the audacity to win .
if i am in the evening with my patients &apos; records and i have to go to bed , then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspires millions and gave the aurora to a speech .
the election was held at a landslide and news cracker , held inne to reassure the historical significance of this hour .
my class camera and wink before i was happy and my parents collected all the newspapers i read .
a young team of visionary was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when , back in 2008 , obama came to power , he had agreed to the value of 82 % .
and then i will close the book .
to switch back to the present is a bad thing .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times .
in the years since i first started voting , i have been very concerned about the situation .
but it is simply nothing that i would have imagined .
i recognise the great efforts made by the commission and the various parties that have been made .
i agree that the european union must be more than just a political blockade .
but , having seen countless times the obama administration ’ s counterparts and acquaintances , i am not satisfied with my explanations at the end .
i have one point of political despair .
republican blockade policy cannot explain that the us is not allowed to intercept foreign heads of state .
it is unacceptable that the commission should be able to impose sanctions on the member states , and that the national security agency should be able to provide information on us private life .
it is unacceptable that the eu should not be a member of the un security council , mr anwar al-awlaki , without trial , nor should the public funding and spending limits be exceeded during the presidential elections .
it justifies the results of a report which calls for the commission to make efforts to improve the situation in the region .
and , most recently , it cannot be the inability to speak in more than three years since the adoption of the affiliate program .
i do not know if it is that which i would have expected .
whether i am with 18 would have understood that the government work was the same as the political campaigns preceding it .
obviously , the members &apos; office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and a random event like the newtown massacre have left public debate .
but if i look at the above examples , i can see that they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that does not bother me most .
i have proposed a new obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candidacy .
mitt romney presented a confusing list of questions that were not sufficiently well understood , but he seemed to be moving in the direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would make the hope that he would not be disappointed for so long .
but with the fall in the level of approval for obama on below 45 % this week , the return to 2010 is marked by this book all the more severe .
it is a source of hope in me for the many promises that have been made in the air .
this week i read a section in the book that describes how to use obama to fight a severe loss against clinton in the pre-election in pennsylvania .
in a meeting with the polling agents following the decision , he told his staff that they had to go back to the course and follow the purpose of their case .
“ i want you to be able to regain our magic , ” he said .
we must remember that the people we are .
it is five years later , mr presider , and i could give you no more than that .
the measures described in this comment are not necessarily the same as those expressed by nathaniel morris .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has a conflict of interests in parental leave .
the billionaire and fellow member , clive palmer , says that prime minister tony abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters will become pregnant and could therefore benefit .
the mining magnat , which is located in a judicial dispute between the two companies , is a very important factor in the fight against climate change .
the palmer united party ( palm united ) could vote up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be abolished or reduced .
but palmer claimed that the only ministers who had conflicts of interest were ministers and that the daughters of abbott personally would benefit from the laws .
“ he is in a great interest conflict , if it is about paid jobs , ” he said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission palmer declared that it had won 53 votes after the recount .
palmer called for a revision of the process of ballot counting so that it could be done more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” said he .
why should we not have a system where we can go into the market and get the data into a computer ?
palmer criticized the use of pencils when marking the voting cell .
if you use them because you then want to erase the results if you want to dislike them ?
today , with pencils , it is incredible .
the electoral commission has taken into account the options for electronic voting and has recently adopted a joint legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , declared that the number of people who are in the international airport in the sunshine coast was one of his policy , and that he was “ very serious ” about taking his new post .
in a public office , it is about the service of the public .
“ we are not seeking any reward other than the history , namely that we are in a critical time of this community , ” said he .

the bank , which has not made a comment on the suspension , has not confirmed that it has not yet received the information requests from authorities .
“ our investigation into the matter has been continued and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities , ” said the bank a couple of weeks ago .

hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credi are registered trademarks of hsbc .
banks are now undergoing instant messaging and e-mails from several years in search of cases of malpractice .
the news about these investigations has been made available to traders in one area , which is in the last few years becoming one of the most profitable of trading-units of investment banks .
some bankers have tried to keep the affair down and said that they were almost impossible to get the money to cover the vast and highly lethal market .
a leading dealer noted that the company was not able to provide the necessary liquidity despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading .
the news came on the same day when credi was awarded the &quot; blue flag &quot; .
the bank informed prominently of the competent authorities and cooperates with them .
“ we are sure that the dealer will act alone and that the matter will be contained ” , says the creator , ceo of credit suisse .

your motto on the big poster hiete was &quot; we are against bauen &quot; .
i would like to draw your attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day .

but they are beginning to resign , because the city has not yet received these replies , it says on the part of the bi .
how to hear was , the effects of public statements on the ombudsman have also been felt .

the most recent occasion for ranking in the critique was yellow for some of the 3 : 0 against the grödig last sunday , when the senegalese was given a supposed actress to be sentenced - the release .
&quot; a blatant misdecision &quot; , rangoon said , the shooting referee harkam was &quot; completely overstretched &quot; .
harkam would also have &quot; his part &quot; to escalate between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig coach adi hütter after the match .

&quot; for i am the one who has been offended . &quot; i stressed that the 46-year-old .

this is to continue .

it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supra court , decided to open the door to the us economy , closely linked to barack obama .

the complaint against the law was of 26 federal states and the national federal federation of independent states .
the law was adopted by all the leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenge of being a member of the republican party , mitt romney .
norway : norway is the norwegian location with a huge mirrors of light .
with huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a norwegian village have shed light on their dark valley .
because of the low sunlight level , the sun sinks into the sea in the vestfjord valley from autumn to spring .
with three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height , the first test was held on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , schwärmmeister steinar bergland was staging a campaign at the start time in the tv2 channel .
some of the talented inhabitants of the valley retreat to sunchairs , others used sunglasses for security purposes .
so far , sun-hungry people have had to travel to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to cut the rays with mirrors into the valley .
this basic idea is to be found in the history of the village since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the council finally had the 5 million crowns ( around 615 000 euros ) expensive project adopted .
a similar construction provides a new dimension to the italian alpine resort of viganella for several years .

the group that has been holding thousands of former nortel patents has been rigorously tightening up a avalanche of patent infringement proceedings against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , which is a company that has been involved in insolvency proceedings .
rockstar , the consortium that is the nortel patents for 4,5 billion dollars , is the largest manufacturer of software and services in the world .
rockstar is located in the community of apple , microsoft , blackberry , and erika .
google will be able to use the term &quot; google &quot; in seven cases of patent infringement .
the patents would cover technology , the search terms and the internet with relevant content , in accordance with the rules of the kla , the legal action that is thereby at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives of samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar were not directly reachable .

egypt is sworn off the first freely elected president of the republic of egypt with the first freely elected freely elected president of the country .
mohammed mursi is placing the oath of office , but his day of triumph is unlikely to be the end of political disagreements in egypt .
islam is a muslim , and the islamic republic of morsi promised a “ new egypt ” when he was first elected freely .
with his inauguration to the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also the first freely elected islamist president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 in black robes , and the referee of the court , which gave his seat on the nile and was dedicated to an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said morsi during the solemn ceremony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy , and stability , ” said the 60 year-old mursi , a us military officer .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building , as mursi was shortly after eleven o ’ clock in a small car convoy .
only a few hundred supporters had signed up to the court , to give the new president a chance to express his opinion , and , unlike the presidential prunk from mubarak , the traffic was only temporarily stopped , so that the new president could be used .
as an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the brotherhood , the country ’ s personal prestige has been a major factor since its victory and a friday speech , in which it proved not only a candidate for islamists , but also a candidate .
“ egypt is a civilian , political , and constitutional state today , ” said the president of the republic of egypt , who declared a blue suit with red tie .
later mursi continued to go to cairo university , where he began his inaugural speech .
he was officially arrested by an army band .
the military leader feldmarschall hussein tantawi was present .
in his arrival he was attacked by hundreds of people in the largest auditorium of the university with chords of “ the army and the people are a hand ” .
the new hotel was built in 1908 as bastion of secular education .
morsi laid the foundations for a symbolic oath on friday , at tahir-platz , the birthplace of the uprising that was ending last year .
but with the removal of the official oath before the court and not as usual before the parliament , it prevents the will of the military to do so , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at the tahir-square was full of dramatic populist gestures .

the act had a nationwide horror .
the then 21-year-old had anene boysen in february in an industrial site in bordasdorp near cape town .
14 hours fought the doctors and the police for the survival of the victim , but in vain .
the sight of the young was so horrifying that the pampering and sisters were not given psychological assistance .
kana had a great deal of influence during the trial , during the tatnight with boys in a bar .
he acknowledged that the world was beaten and rape .
the police were initially surrounded by several criminals , but they left two suspects and two were arrested .
the prosecutor &apos;s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that the cana had been in possession of the attacker .
rape is one of the most widespread crimes in south africa : every year , there are about 64 000 indications of sexual violence .
these are almost ten times the amount of money available in germany , but it is still significantly higher than in the united states , with 82 million people .

jumbo visits the black forest schinken and visits the schinken .
jumbo on the search for the &quot; best sling &quot; of the world &quot; : for the tv broadcast &quot; galileo &quot; visited the german pro7-star bonndorf .

details such as the ph-value of the meat play a role .
the darker the meat , the higher the ph-value .
&quot; i am curious about what you say when you are robberto blanco , what happens &quot; , he says .
this is where the level of private television is set in pure culture .
but the watching is worthwhile .
the spectator sees that the fragmentation of the chickens continues to be hand work .
because : black forest schinken is traditionally without bones in the shelf .
the secret of the ham is the good and the good taste .

flight centre seems to be moving towards a more modern approach .
the company has increased its profits for the total year .
the travel company is now moving from a cleaned annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared with the same amount of 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast .

she has &quot; us with so many question marks &quot; , that we are not being given the call sign .
johanna rahner says : &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the era of anger of death &quot; .
this is linked to the question of the longing to &quot; reawaken to the day that everything will be good &quot; .

illuminated lake : second mountain bike trail , the &quot; schladming-dachstein &quot; ( mountain bike race ) will enthral participants from all over the world to the new year .
with a wonderful weather , 214 bikers came to illmensee , to discover the circuit of the hills of the salzkammergut .
this is what ulrich knobel tells us about the event .
among the participants were , in particular , the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 meters of altitude , also numerous everyone &apos;s visitors .
two junior suites are available for guests of the top german class .
these two could be expected to be resisted from the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to make a small advance in time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .
in second place , the team won the second place , pascal fiubel .
the ladies were not very happy with the idea of a duelli team albrecht , who made it at the top of the winning stadium .
in second place and three came anne adel from irelmensee and leonie driber from owingen .
a pleasing development is the increasing number of people travelling by car to the european union .

the main race was the first one in the world to win more absolute top prizes .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care .
dr. georges bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages and towns in cameroon .
bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with hundreds of patients .
the west african country has a population of not many doctors , but only one in five thousand people .
do you agree here or with your mobile device ?
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can choose for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work .
21 years ago , georges bwelle saw how his sick father was always to raise awareness .
jamef bwelle was born in 1981 in the united states in an accident involving a car accident .
first he had only broken a broken arm , then he was formed .
“ there was no neurosurgery , but there was no neurosurgery in cameroon . ” says georges bwelle .
we would have had him removed from cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , he spent bwave years in his father &apos;s overcrowded clinical trials and hospitals , and was a member of the family .
“ it is not easy , ” commented bwelle .
you can reach the hotel at 5 a.m.
there are many patients .
some people even die because they are having to wait .
the situation has hardly changed , since bse was first mentioned by bwell &apos;s father in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the world health organization .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is between a doctor and 413 people .
but even if there is a doctor for you , you may be more likely to be able to afford the visit .
two out of five people live in the country below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health expenditure in the country is private .
“ the only problem we have is that you have poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to achieve the survival of life .
his father and so many of his compatriots suffered in bwelle the decision to leave something to do about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have worked together 700 free operations last year .
he was a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon in central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization , called ascovime , which is involved in the rural areas at weekends and which provides free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his volunteers have contributed almost 32,000 people .
almost every friday , the council and the commission are constraining themselves by up to 30 people and are driving with the slender medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages , which need help .
not always the whole process is smooth .
more than once , they have had to replace the vehicles with rivers and mud .
but if you arrive , you will be like heroes : a feast for the soul , a singing and a dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bwelle – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is gladly at the happy hour .
the next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of people who have been diagnosed .
“ pro ride we treat 500 people ” , says bwelle .
they come from a circle of 60 kilometres and they come to the village – and this on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people will be sentenced to death for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .
others are getting crutches , ghostly glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is not required for school to be a school , but which many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local anesthesia .
the operations are usually performed in a school , the town hall or a flat .
the lighting for the op and the deck is very small .
it is a strenuous adventure , but the people of the village are usually helping to get the team motivated .
“ they drummed the whole night so we could wake up and see our work continue , ” says bwelle .
on sunday the team will then go back to the city , tired , but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has , last year , carried out 700 free operations and knows that they are working to make a huge difference for the people who are denied help .
a man explained that the free operation of a mercedes-benz that he received was now able to provide him with his work again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekly clinics and his work as surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works in private clinics in yaoundé at night .
with this second job , we finance 60 % of its non-profit activities , so we bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” says katie o &apos;malley , who was born in the second year at the drexel university in philadelphia medicine and freelance in bwelles .
it is always in hospital or in the hospital , or it is trying to get money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .
for medical and health care professionals , the same applies to o &apos;malley , who have been expelled from the usa and europe and are supporting bwelle , and this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
“ we can be very successful in operations , ” said dr. peter schumann , head of the department of the department of human medicine , at the university of vienna .
that would be a medical student in america in the second year .
students pay their journey to cameroon usually themselves and often bring the spectators ’ health equipment with them .
are you only interested in yaounda , the bwelle company is offering you accommodation , transport and instruction .
“ he is without doubt a hero ” , says o &apos;malley .
he is devoted to his life to this organization and his desire to help the cameroon people know no borders .
for bwelle , the almost constant work is not a burden .
others to be happier life .
“ i am so happy that i can make this work . ” he said .
and i am thinking of my father .
i hope he sees that he is doing what i am doing .
i am not doing it to reconnect people to laugh and to make the pain worse .

excellent the fight gemeisert , the first one in the world .
the role of santiago , the old man in heminghway. it is a new &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; .
janson is himself an old hand in his diet , the actress .
the old man santiago can not be accused of fishing .
for example , the two are simply great .
they are almost saying that the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman speaks manolo , can be seen .
if santiago mourns tired of life on the stomach , it is the same with janson .
in addition , the role of old fishermen is by and through a character role , which janson excellently meistert .
hemingway is telling me the story of a fighter , a courageous man , who has not given up and ultimately has been driven by his knowledge and also his will to fight the fish .
janson is a very popular and exclusive artist in many sectors .
it manages to draw the public &apos;s attention to itself , and to make it more accessible to the public .
his efforts to protect the fish at last to the surface of the water are so ephemeral that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue .
director of the film jens hasselmann lets the old man on the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the course of the performance , he continues to set the active scene in perspective : the santiago hut , the bar of the singer marie-luise gunst , which is decorated with her songs and her wonderful voice .
the four musicians play kuba-rousseau to do so , and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the roman islands of the isle of sant &apos;egidio , the roman empire , the roman empire , the roman empire , the roman empire , the roman empire , the roman empire and the roman empire .
on some 120 metres , the hotel is located below cologne , a sewage channel from the roman era .
if you are visiting cologne , you will not be able to get past the cathedral .
about 157 metres , the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest mountain in the world .
but few visitors , who visit the two branches , are still impressed by the beauty of the landscape .
rainer schulze is an expert in the field of teaching cologne .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the dom .
the tour starts at an unspectacular point .
in the 1970s , the british and dutch fathers wanted to build a city that is just fit for the car , and so the remains of the old city wall remained just what was not too big .
