the report : even more security for pedestrians and pedestrians .
they are not 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the european parliament &apos;s opinion is that the new b 33-foot amplifier is to be put into operation at the village car park - in sight of the older town hall samples .
two plants so close to each other : intention or turtle ?
this question has been addressed by the mayor of the city yesterday .
&quot; the town hall samples are then installed and the city hall was built in order to secure the school way &quot; , eckert explained yesterday .
the kluser-traffic light both safe cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the official start of the plant was made yesterday important for the crossing area of sulzbachweg / kirchstraße .
we have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank , as well as the traffic flow from the residencial area gru› b ‹ .
&quot; at the high traffic and pedestrian traffic volume , it was necessary to create another traffic light for their safety , &quot; reckert said .
this is confirmed by peter arnold of the council of landratrat offenburg .
&quot; according to current measurements , the b 33 runs through around 12 000 vehicles daily through the municipality of gutach , of which about 10 % are heavy traffic &quot; , emphasises arnold .
therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : &quot; safety is simply on the way &quot; , arnold said .
in total , four traffic shows were carried out , including a roundabout was also considered , but due to the close proximity in the sulzbachweg / kirchstrasse junction .
it was named arnold at the location of the traffic lights in the city .
the approximately eur 15 000 amplitude plant itself is the most modern in the world at the moment .
the complex is equipped with coloured leds , which are so bright that the lights are not too bright for the drivers .
and economical it is also : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new ones only eight watts .
the maximum distance between the two lights is 3 .
arnold explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .
press the pedestrian to turn the light button , the driver will test the upper radar sensor to determine the traffic situation .
is the road free , comes directly green for the pedestrian , when not , takes a little more than 15 seconds .
another radar sensor checks whether the radar phase is correct for the pedestrian .
&quot; if a group or persons with walking disabilities should go over the street , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be able to travel safely , &quot; explained arnold .
of course , drivers must be a partner here and the drivers must observe the track .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic lights showed up for pedestrians green , smoked a top class car , and the traffic lights were not working .

the book is well known for its first edition of the &quot; the author of the book &quot; , the theatre texts are rar .
collage from prosatextes gerhard fresacher presents for his performance &quot; wetterlüchten auf der zungenspitze &quot; , which is now available in garage x am petersplatz .
the theatre maker combines about elements from the automotive industry with the modern , autobiographical novel &quot; der leibeigene &quot; ( 1987 ) .
on the largely empty machine , the new york times , the new york times , the new york times , and the new york times have been the scene of a series of events .
in doing so , director fresacher seems to have little faith in the text .
the 70-minute performance of the project is exaggerated by a plethora of director injuries , known from the repertoire postdramatist forms of play .
the focal point of the show is the fact that the actors sometimes find themselves in a rather dubious setting .
they are hard-pressed to keep their heads under water .

the text is based on this hard way , however .

american street planners are looking for a monetary source that will help to reduce the declining highway system .
the devices that each user can control every kilometre of traffic and pass on information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by washington and the plans for the european union .
the normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly reached an intensive debate with buntled alliances .
libertarians have been working with environmental groups and are in favour of the eu government taking the small boxes to the record the polluted goods .
the tea party is deplorable .
the american civil rights association ( aclu ) is also deeply concerned and deeply concerned about a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress has not agreed on a course of action , several federal states are no longer waiting .
they are currently examining how they can be implemented over the next ten years into a system in which drivers are paid for each mile in danger .
thousands of drivers have lost their driving licences , many of which are equipped with gps monitoring .
that is really a must for our country .
“ it is nothing we can only use if we are able to do so , ” said hasan ikhrata , managing director of the southern california institute of technology .
the way in which we are going to pay these taxes will change .
the technology for this is there .
the initiative comes at a time when the highway truck fleet is being used to finance the economy .
but in america , it is not so much tangled as it was before .
cars consume less petrol .
the state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon of government oil ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has been a non-existent for 20 years .
politicians dare to take the risk of driving the tax even by a penny , at high prices .
“ the petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” lee munnich said , an expert on transport legislation at the university of minnesota .
his state has recently bought 500 cars with tachographs , and the government has been able to create a mile-based payment system .
“ this is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .
bureaucrats call it the milestone based user benefit .
not surprisingly , the idea of urban liberals has been embraced , because the tax could be used to promote the driving behaviour of the way in which stalls and climate damage are reduced .
california ’ s planners rely on the system in drawing up policies that will help to reduce the ambitious , legally enshrined aims of the federal state on climate change .
but the republican bill shuffle from pennsylvania has been a member of the house transportation committee , and has also declared that the republican party is in it the most viable long-term alternative .
free movement of goods and services is also a key issue for the reason that the reason for the success of the reason foundation is to pay drivers on a long distance .
“ this is not a tax that is paid in a black hole , ” explains adrian moore , vice president of directives at readason .
people pay directly for what they do .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers , who were in a report in 2011 to invite congress to take part in the milestones based on the accounting system .
the us senate approved a new law on the subject of the death penalty last year , which was $ 90 million expensive .
but the majority in the house of representatives prevented the push and reacted with it to the concerns of members from rural areas who were not represented by people who were in the everyday life often to spend many miles on their way to work or city .
several states and large cities are moving in the right direction , however .
the most dedicated is oregon , the current 5,000 driver for the largest experiment of the country .
these drivers will soon be charged mileage instead of the oil tax to the federal state .
nevada has already launched a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a .
illinois tests it in restricted mode and uses lkws .
and the i-95 coalition is the one that the transport ministers have asked for from 17 states to participate in .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently working with the equipment , car drivers were sceptical about the idea of the government could control each of its movements .
“ concerns about big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains alauddin khuan , head of the strategy and development team at the university of hamburg .
people wanted to do it .
when the test was started , the commission warned that the aclu from nevada on their website was “ it would be relatively easy to include the tachograph in full-grown monitoring devices . ”
there is no need to create a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure .
nevada is part of a number of states that are now seeking affordable technology .
i am not saying that this would mean that the public would be more reassured .
hunting for this technology has led to a small startup boom company called true mickey mouse in california .
the company was not originally established to provide state states with a tax on car drivers .
rather , it was their aim to create a new market for car manufacturers , which would allow them to compete with the rest of the world on the basis of the miles they have travelled .
but the information it has tested is also very important for road planners , because they do not work with gps and only deliver limited information that is regularly transmitted via modem .
“ people are more willing to participate in it , if their speed and location are not increased .
in some of these public pilot programmes , major mistakes have been made .
there are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .
in oregon , the planner experiments with using car drivers to create a series of choices .
you can register for a device with or without gps .
or they do not choose any device at all and pay a flat fee based on the average cost of the entire journey , which is the same for all residents of the federal state .
others hope that the concept of a motion of censure will be able to sell by using the equipment with more functions .
in new york city , transport officials want to set up a taxation device that will also reduce the cost of parking , but only provide insurance for dangerous kilometres .
“ drivers would be protected by the added value of the benefits that the system offers .
some road planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge waste of time .
the metropolitan hotel transportation. the commission for the area of san francisco bay declared that officials had been working on the congress to resolve the problem of bankruptcy highway trust fund .
an additional one-time fee or annual fee of eur 1.50 may be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol .
“ there is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is also sufficient ” , explains dr. randy rdefler , who is head of legislation and public affairs of the commission .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of car drivers will worry about their privacy .
the royal field : small team beats wacker and the team is wacker .
voluntary firefighters are irrigated by their autumn main probe despite personnel shortages with brown and white .
only 11 men participated in the exercise .
the division commander hans kaiser had been in his usual practice and had been able to use the property feader in the burgberger straße .
the sampling is to be made by means of a short circuit .
the resulting industry has created a new and growing trend for smoke , one of which has not yet been able to send an emergency call .
two breathing protectors of the defense were deployed after the first check of the situation by hans kammer , ready to enter the building .
after a short time , the first person was able to find and enter the open .
the second person had to be worn .
this was not so easy , as a close staircase was to be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stone and a small barn for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it was a lot of wood and also straw bales in it .
there were also electric machines for wood processing .
the first extinguishing attack was made via the tank in the vehicle .
another management was the creation of a large overhaul and hydrant in about 100 metres distance .
three holes could be designed .
the new version of the new version of the new version of the original version of the original version of the original version was released .
hans kammerer was the culmination of the exercise to show what was happening with little available knowledge .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the königsfeld daily operation group .
the commander was very familiar with the course of the exercise .
networking of universities and companies important for the success of the company .
during his visit to the district of breisgau-hochschwarzwald , rural president guido wolf was able to inform himself of the situation in titisee new stadt about where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the high-altitude black forest development centre , he went to the university of hamburg together with the managing directors of vocational schools and the district gymnasium and the parents ’ advisory committee chairs on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important factor in the location &quot; , underlined claudia stelle , director of the hans-thoma school , who has developed the networked education centre in hochschwarzwald .
the first of these was the first model of the new generation of the german model .
since 2011 , the world ’ s forests have been cooperating successfully between the foerderzentrum , kreisgymnasium and berufsschulzentrum .
i also praised the family friendliness of the district .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to be able to cope with the period of family care due to demographic change .
he also said that the situation is becoming more and more concerned with care for and care for their families .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting increase in the workforce could lead to an end to the working relationship . &quot;
but no one can afford to buy skilled workers .
another aspect of the report is the networking of high-level and enterprise .
&quot; for whoever has been the precursor of the region during his studies , remains in touch with his acquired knowledge and his skills .
only if there is sufficient training places available can the european court of justice be able to cover the needs of skilled workers .
in his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
moreover , he experienced a great deal of political instability on his train journey from titisee neustadt to freiburg , which has already been made .
&quot; stay firm and do not let the world go on with the war .
with music an entertaining afternoon experience , you can experience an entertaining afternoon with music and experience an entertaining afternoon in the city .
for 15 years now , the kaul family has been inviting dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .
in the past , the elderly were often left in the resting place .
in the meantime , this afternoon is taking place in the foster home of st. josef .
the home residents were happy with the delicious meals of the cakes and cakes .
later there were sausages .
with standard melodies , the silvia kitmich-bantle and their father karl kimme had a very special relationship with the band .
the more than 100 year old stone wall as a front delimitation of the old building , which is in front of the renovation , is to be reopened with the cost plan of the city of bräunlingen .
in the days before the kilbig was at the first works of the renovation of the front school a small tiny angle wall , to stabilize and static relief of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .
the way forward is to say , alexander misok , that the tanning machine in the city of bräunlingen , the landmarks office , should be included in the planning and a plan for rehabilitation of the old wall .
after that , a cost calculation by experts is to be carried out , which will then be made available to the municipal council to decide and determine what further action to take .
a decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year .
after the renovation , the plaster and the planting of the old school tree , the school building was rebuilt within the two wing of the school built in 1912 .
the historic , one hundred year old demarcation wall of the old school building to the church road is particularly protected by water and frost damage , since no drainage is available .
deep cracks in individual bricks bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not collapsing at the moment .
a solid wall is a prerequisite for a pupils using schulhof , which is guaranteed by the current fixing works .
originally , the schulhofsrehabilitation was already in place in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift .
one important word in the historical school wall renovation that even existed for film recordings is the national monument .
if any of the terms of this agreement is found to be applicable , the city of bräunlingen hopes to receive subsidies from the conservation authorities .
the students of the tanning school of primary school , which has now been re-established in a well-sanded old school building with new aula , can soon experience the old school courtyard .
özdemir wants to train jazz in stuttgart .
in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in baden-württemberg , the issue of the future of cem özdemir , federal president of the greens , has also been addressed .
&quot; i think it is wrong to ignore the holistic training in the music college stuttgart .
jazz and classical music are just at the jazz site in stuttgart .
this is not the case , mr özdemir , who was born in stuttgart as a favor of a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 september , the green red state government .
this forces the commission to take action on the basis of an expert study to reorganize the five music universities in baden-württemberg .
the aim is to improve the performance of jazz and pop by the music academy in stuttgart and the city of music in the direction of the munich music academy .
u.s. border : &quot; super tunnels &quot; to drug smuggling discovered the world &apos;s largest drug smuggling site .
on the border between mexico and the us , investigators have created a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to smuggle drugs and have decommissioned .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long roman wall was not a good solution between tijuana and san diego with electricity , railway tracks and an aeration system .
three suspects were thus arrested and the government sentenced eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kg of cocaine .
the tunnel was not , according to the data , yet in use .
&quot; this cartels are stupid when they think they could be under the radar .
the drug gangs have been assured of duffy : &apos; if you continue to use such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to do so at a huge waste of your smuggling money . &apos;
both the us authorities and the mexican security forces are in a permanent state of war against drug cartels .
since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with drug crime .
experts construct a new type of machine designed by experts .
because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the erasmus assume that the tunnel is designed by architects and engineers .
the track system was equipped to allow the installation of electrically operated cars .
on mexican side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 metres deep to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres and 90 inches of width .
it would also have been a good way of combating illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .
the third , a mexican , was sentenced to death for seizure of marijuana .
all three face the threat of a maximum penalty of life-long deprivation , as officials have said .
since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , but they were reported to have been on the press conference in san diego .
it is the first time that the european parliament has had a debate on cocaine in this way .
usually cocaine is used in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .
this shows the &quot; desperation &quot; of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill clinton said .
they would do everything they can to go to the us .
the detainees were not given any details , at least one of them was mexicans .
they must be punished with prison sentences of up to ten years .
in 2014 , geisinger festjahr becomes the festjahr 2014 hosted festival year of the geisinger festjahr .
the anniversary of the city of geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .
the reversal of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer .
if in more than eight weeks the year is over , the anniversary of the year is over .
hostage-singing and church households were born in 794 for the first time together .
in churches , a certificate was produced , in which both places are mentioned .
on 15 march there will be an official start to the anniversary year of the european union , and since geisingen is not currently in a hall , this opening event will take place in the place where the first two people were mentioned 1250 years ago , in church .
in the context of the anniversary , several events are being held both in geisingen and in kirchen-hausen .
church house in the village of kazimierz , germany , will host the 1250 church house party in july on a weekend of the 18th to 20th of july .
we are celebrating the resumption .
on friday with a festact , on saturday and sunday with a festival around the church alley .
at this weekend , there is also the church house piano festival , which takes place in the town of kaprun .
city music director rudolf barth has created a new album for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be presented at three events .
on 21 june , together with the sunday celebration of the black forest association , on 12 july in the arena with fireworks and on 13 december as the first concert of the city music in the new festhalle .
this is celebrated in the anniversary year and is inaugurated , the official date is the last weekend of september , 27 and 27 august .
on the occasion of the geisinger city anniversary , the exhibition will be accompanied by a new chronicle .
&quot; but it should be a chronicle not only of violins themselves , but a printed book .
and the intellectual property of today also celebrates 2014 .
the new chronicle will be published on 21 or 22 november in the new festhalle in geisingen .
in 2014 , however , another year with many anniversary celebrations .
the narration straw glonki starts on february 8 with a traditional brewery evening on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary , the harmony gutmadingen will be 90 years and opened on march 29 the festival banquet and festival .
the altenwerk leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the geisinger school has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 may , the musikverein polyhymnia leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it .
the town of geisingen was built in a certificate of donation which is owned by the st. gallen monastery in 764 .
the certificate was issued in churches ( houses ) .
both communities are therefore able to find the same document .
reason 2014 of this 1250 year anniversary accordingly to celebrate , in addition to the municipal form 40 years back .
the council takes track systems to its knees .
if the railway crossing is to be opened &quot; at hirschen &quot; in a complex way to increase traffic safety ?
yes , do local authorities have decided .
schiltach must be eur 220 000 for this .
deutsche bahn wants to make the cinema show a success this coming year .
in particular , safety at the crossings of the railway should be increased - there are frequent collisions between trains across germany with other vehicles .
do the communities agree to the restructuring measures , they must deal with one third of the costs they incur , the rest share the railway and the federal government .
schiltacht city builder roland grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specificities of the bahüggang &quot; am hirschen &quot; .
the commission is planning to invest in the amount of the tunnel mill there in the west of the railway track .
there , larger vehicles could also be built , such as those transporting long timber , in counter-traffic , without blocking the track .
greeks therefore proposed that a necessary support for the construction of a base wall should be built to prevent the city from leaving the road to the next .
this was discussed in the municipal council in controversial terms , as some councils have not recognised the need for road distribution : thomas kipp , in his statement , brought the mood of critics to the point : &apos; because of so few vehicles we have to take so few money so few cars so much ?
mayor thomas haas disagreed : the railway crossing &quot; hirschen &quot; was regularly used for long-distance transport .
even wood from the &quot; cow &quot; area is partly transported over this route , because the up to 20 metres long vehicles have left the track at the häberllar bridge because they are not included in the main road .
in addition , the route is used as a redirection for those vehicles that will not use the tunnel when the main road is closed .
as it can be seen that kirchberg and schlossberg tunnels have been rebuilt and restored , as the current situation in wolfgang is , the railway transition could be followed by the &quot; hirschen &quot; for a long period .
the councils agreed to investigate how the eu &apos;s financial resources are to be used to spread the road .
nevertheless , the conversion of the railway crossing of the railway was approved by a majority with the proviso that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can take the road to the &quot; bahnhofstraße &quot; if necessary for 5 , if necessary .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at gerberi trautwein could , on the other hand , have a completely different problem , which could hinder access to the rapidly increasing &quot; geroltzhäuser weg &quot; .
the administration had to make the plans for the railway from brüinfinger engineering office to investigate the problem of the construction of the railway , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the geroltzhäuser was still possible .
the investigation concluded that the commission was not able to rule out the possibility of tightening the road &apos;s tightly winding conditions .
the responsibility for this lies with the city as a road load carrier .
the conversion could therefore be made without any liability .
since both the deforestation and the offturn in the current expansion condition worked , the building should be left to the reconstruction of the railway crossing .
it is also worth mentioning here the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing in the transition much less than the other railway crossings , because the stop is right next to the center where a good visible connection is found .
even trains from the main station would have to be dropped here so far that the train station is not in danger of collision .
the majority of the members of the railway were agreed to the conversion of this railway crossing , as schiltach was able to solve the problem of seated vehicles , as the wheels of the council have decided to move to the new building .
as an unproblematic the panel considers the conversion to the railway crossing points &quot; before haubach &quot; and &quot; before kuhbach &quot; , for which already crossings with the railway have been made .
esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions of euros , and missions for billions of dollars .
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts in the european space industry - are required to make their way to two major projects that they will be able to launch in the next few years .
30 proposals were selected , five are still in the race .
far worlds .
more than 1000 planets on other stars have astronomers already found .
whether it is at least some of them , nobody knows .
the choice is difficult : should you go to gravitational waves ?
or rather the origin of the cosmos ?
or after earth &apos;s similar planets , and perhaps alien planet life , ?
these questions are the ones that are particularly asking the european space agency esa .
for your program &quot; cosmic vision &quot; you are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a decisive contribution to research .
the budget for such &quot; l missions &quot; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the start is expected to be in 2028 and 2034 .
in early september , in paris , the elite of the european space research community met to make proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , five of them are now in the closer elections .
many bodies are examining the proposals that hack the coins of researchers .
in the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .
four major issues have been raised by the esa , which the missions of the european space agency ( cosmic vision ) , initiated in 2007 , will be answered .
what are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?
the exact procedures for the creation of new stars are described in detail in the section called “ star formation ” .
a large infrared telescope with a wide range of light sources could penetrate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?
to address this issue , 2017 is to be the space telescope &quot; cheops &quot; .
the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of $ 150 million .
with larger instruments , astronomers could produce earth like planets , and even determine the composition of their atmospheres , thus searching for &quot; biomarkers &quot; : gases that are used as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this question , too , is to ultimately provide an explanation of the conditions for the creation of life .
the role of magnetism is important for a star and the interaction of its magnetic field .
in our solar system , these processes can be exemplary .
the &quot; solar orbiting &quot; has been the first time that esa has launched a m-class mission ( there is the budget about half a billion euros ) for this issue .
the probe is to start in 2017 and the surface and activity of the sun is closely monitored .
i am very interested in the researchers , too , jupiter and his moons .
you want to find out what role the giant plantation plays in the development of the solar system .
the esa provides for this the first of the three l missions of the &quot; cosmic vision &quot; program .
the probe &quot; juice &quot; ( jupiter icy moons explorer ) begins its journey ahead of the earth in 2022 .
eight years later , jupiter is to reach jupiter and to preserve the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy monde europe , kallisto and ganymed .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
the space offers many possibilities to create material under extreme conditions .
perhaps the difference between the two is also evident , which will lead physicists to a new theory , under which the whole world of natural laws merges .
how is the universe born and what is it ?
the first of these was the creation of our cosmos by the big bang .
in addition to the experience of the subject , which is made up of stars , planets and living beings like us , there are dark matter , the gravity of which is galaxies and galaxies .
so far , researchers have not known the physical laws that apply in the first few seconds , nor what the physical laws of the big bang were .
with &quot; euclid &quot; the esa has already developed an m-mission here .
with a special telescope , the probe is intended to determine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky , thus drawing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark matter .
if you could run the race , you can get the chance to win the race .
of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection process , only two remain .
the best chance of obtaining a grant as an l mission is , according to many experts , &quot; e-lisa &quot; , a demanding concept for demonstrating gravitational waves .
physicists understand changes in the structure of space time , which albert einstein introduced almost 100 years ago .
it has been proven to date that they have not .
elisa could do so , but the scientists hope to support the project .
the mission envisages a two-phase probe with a detector that is located in the space .
it could , unlike plants on earth , be gravitational waves , which could be used in the big bang .
four other proposals still compete for the second l mission : a big x-ray tube with a large x-ray tube called &quot; athena &quot; , which is black and white holes .
already outdated are under construction proposals for the sampling of the retrofit from mars , for the exploration of moon , venus and asteroids , as well as for solar physics .
snowden ready to work with germany on us surveillance .
edward snowden , the whistleblower of the us intelligence service , has stated that he is willing to go to berlin and , before the german federal parliament , to declare that the american national security agency is in office .
the german member , hans-christian ströbele , met snowden on thursday in russia , where he was granted asylum , to talk to him about the situation in germany .
in a letter from snowden , which was sent on friday by ströbele to the media in berlin , this letter says : ‘ although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is treating a different opinion .
the truth is , however , not a crime .
in the letter , snowden writes that he believes that the european union &apos;s support for the peace process will convince the american government to stop the charge against him .
the us judicial authorities ’ appeal to the us department includes spionage and theft of prisoners of state , and the prosecution is not responsible for the prosecution .
the german interior minister hans-peter friedrich said to time online : “ if mr snowden is willing to cooperate with german representatives , he will find a way to make that possible . ”
relations between the us and germany are characterised by the claims that the us and germany have not yet signed the mobile phone by chancellor angela merkel .
thomas oppermann , the member who has been the chief executive officer of the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that you should seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as a witness if this is possible , ‘ without jeopardising relations and protecting them ’ .
ströbele , a green mep , published a picture of himself and snowden in his twitter feed .
he was arrested on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former nsa employee snowden was not sent back to russia if he had left the country .
when snowden is said to be in germany , then he needs an assurance that he will be “ safe ” there , the member says .
snowden explains in his letter that he is committed to a “ serious and ongoing ” policy of persecution .
however , it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression ” .
citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the united states – have been deeply shocked by uncontrolled systems of comprehensive surveillance than a merit in the public .
in his letter , snowden makes the german authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved , ” he says .
frontier airlines charges a fee for hand baggage , which is charged at the airport .
frontier airlines plans to deliver up to 100 us dollars of passenger services to the united states and canada on their flight .
frontier airlines intends to deliver up to usd 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade .
the new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .
frontier explained that it is calculated $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 .
front-page speaker kate o &apos;malley said that the fee of 100 us dollars targets to be paid to travellers .
“ we want to avoid calculating this amount , ” she explained .
airlines began to charge passengers for the first and second listed flight in 2008 .
passengers who tried to travel through them were not allowed to travel as much as possible .
fees are one way of forcing passengers to pay less with the same passengers .
o &apos;malley said that the new fee is about not really making a money .
it is about the most loyal clients of frontier , who have clearly stated that they are always finding it harder to find a place in the compartment above the seat .
passengers who have purchased their tickets on the airline website will be required to pay .
this means that a passenger is not allowed to travel from front to rear of a baggage for free , but the next person is allowed to carry 100 dollars for a comparable piece of baggage .
o &apos;malley explained that the site of frontier and the check-in machine procedures would be changed so that passengers could be informed about the fee they have paid before they can get to the terminal .
the new hand baggage fee from frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and a precise date will not yet be available .
passengers chase often over baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines often use them to do so .
they argue that the euro is a good way of carrying luggage and that passengers should not pay for it if they have wanted it .
many of the wall street ’ s new baggage charges see themselves as a sign that the airlines are taking enough money to pay for the costs of flight accidents after years of losses .
most of them , however , have so far been fingers of charges for hand baggage .
spirit airlines is a global leader in the field of aircraft maintenance and repair .
the only other airline with such a fee is the hungarian airlines wizz air , explained the airline-consultant jay sorensen , who has paid careful attention to the additional charges .
he estimated in a report of december 2011 that the handbaggage fee is $ 50 million per year .
sorensen , who used to be a leader in midwest airlines , was the first to introduce the company to spiritual leaders .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth and efficient processes in the world .
i expected to be able to avoid tearing and straightforward discussions at the gate .
“ the plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran like a lubricated aircraft . ”
frontier follows spirit also in the 2 dollars that are used for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .
the company stated that passengers who have been carrying the lemonade or juice will be able to keep the whole can and coffee free of charge .
water remains free .
us airways had a short attempt in 2008 to provide refreshment drinks .
frontier &apos;s step to charge for hand baggage is when passengers are not directly at the airport .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as orbitz 10 to 25 dollars per sold ticket .
this provides a stimulus to all companies to provide passengers with direct purchases instead of having an online travel agency .
frontier is a very important factor in this area .
in september , the company began to provide a free travel agent for reservations only half as many frequent flyer miles as it had previously booked .
on wednesday , the most important mileage was increased to 25 % of the flight .
a third party provider may not use the same flight route with frontier over 1000 miles to bring customers to the airport just 250 miles .
passengers can also only travel by direct purchase on the frontier site .
frontier has a loyal customer base and is a reliable partner for the global financial markets .
the proceeds were received by 9 percent and the flight capacity was shrinking to just 13 percent in the first quarter , as was rightly stated in the financial report published on wednesday by the parent company .
republican has tried to make a profit as part of the company &apos;s sales .
proverbs come from the bible , and they are from the bible .
more than 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of bisingen .
theme of the day in the municipal house were &quot; proverbs from the bible &quot; and &quot; redemptions from the middle ages &quot; .
zita köhler , the chairman of the church council , has gone to the city after breakfast in a lecture on the biblical proverbs .
&quot; proverbs contain life-wisdom , rules , or warnings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several proverbs with the corresponding bible places and explained the importance .
she called it proverbs like : holzauge is vigilant , like scales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone who gives his hands to the lord in sleep , his hands in unguilty .
several times , the deputy left her audience with advice that the project would be a case of a “ good old man ” .
the words from the middle ages were used to refer to the church community office of christ dehner .
it explained the importance and origin of the speeches you made &apos; bridges to the past &apos; .
finally , a raffle was lost .
the prices were covered by a table and were humorously wrapped around before they were sold to the winners .
among the visitors of the breakfast round , the choice of the mayor roman wagner was also mixed .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled workers in tourism .
at the mecklenburgisches seeplatte startetheute a pilot project for the tourism industry .
under the leadership of the federal employment agency , 49 women and men who have already been recognised as unskilled in the industry are to be able to become skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .
&quot; new to this is that the six-month courses with abschluss ended , &quot; said carmen wiechert of the employment agency neubrandenburg .
the benefits are varied : participants would thus not be unemployed , the firms would be given a training place , and the companies would be increasingly involved in hotels and restaurants .
the project also involves the industrial and commercial chambers in neubrandenburg , as well as the german hotel and restaurant association .
nsa explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .
the shadowy national security agency explained at the late friday that a bug has been discovered by your public website for a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .
“ nsa.gov was a few hours out of reach tonight , as during a planned update an internal error occurred . ”
i will not solve the problem this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed trial of denial of service , which was carried out by the ddos , was not true .
in the early evening hours , online server tracking was a matter of course that the nsa-website had at least six hours of unreachable for some users .
previously , a spokesman for the nsa stated to abc news that the eu ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way compromised . ”
secret information is not in danger , according to the spokesman .
at least one group of hacktivists claimed to have been the nsa website with a ddos attack lahti .
in such attacks , the target site is linked to page views .
cybertactics are relatively simple , and the attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system .
the former super-secret nsa , whose nickname was no such agency ( no such authority ) , was found in the middle of the light of day in the public eye and is looking at the events that have been announced in recent months .
the growing controversy over the intelligence services has fueled initial speculation about the possibility of the incident being the result of a targeted cyperoperation .
slightly lowered is the number of people without jobs in october at 22 on 1,307 .
although the quota is 3.1 % better than last year , and the rate is better than in september , &quot; we would have liked to have had more , &quot; says monika felder-bauer , deputy managing director of the agency .
many companies responded to this with attitudes .
one reason for this is , according to felder-bauer , &quot; we have few skilled workers in the crafts , health and care of the elderly &quot; .
seasonal variations have been taking place since september for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector .

profit losses in bombardments following the fall in supply and orders for the first time in the united states , following a decline in supply and orders .
the canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer bombardier inc meldet reported a 15-percent drop in the volume of net gains in the next quarter , having been offset by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter .
bombardier , based in montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new aircraft of the cseries and did not issue any new information as to whether the aircraft was in operation in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next september .
on the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago , only three more launches have been carried out so far , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going on as planned .
the results were not yet clear , and the results led to a change in the course of more than eight percent of the toronto stock exchange .
cameron doerksen , analyst at national bank financial , sends a negative equity rating on thursday .
“ while weaker supply numbers were not compensated for as much by aircraft , the market ’ s marginal development in the transport sector clearly disappoints us , ” said doerksen in a customer letter .
we believe that the bombing of the ground has created new orders for the cseries , if the test programme for the aircraft is progressing .
if , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to follow the programme with sceptical scepticism .
bombardier hopes that the aircraft travel will be more efficient and more efficient in the suburb of the market .
the first test aircraft was launched in march and was flying to the united states after months of delays .
but , so far , binding orders for cseries with 177 moderate , as potential customers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the claims of the company regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings are the new düsseldorf jet .
there are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
the chairman of the board , pierre beaudoin , is confident that bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet .
the management assured the company that on thursday , the analysts and the media also assured that the programme was in the schedule .
“ the test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected , ” said beaudoin at a conference call and added that , while the standstill of the aircraft was ground tests .
each manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take the first flight and then take a reworking period .
this is happening throughout the programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to be delivered in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly thereafter , it was called from the company &apos;s side .
however , analysts remain sceptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer is to fly a cseries aircraft .
bombardier said that it was reviewing the planning for the commissioning ( ice ) and will present it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the airlines ’ test – even if it appears to be bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that the launch of the aircraft is limited to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said doerkherr .
in the third quarter , at the end of september , bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share in the previous year .
the customised profit per share is unchanged 9 cents .
sales were slightly lower than in the previous year , and fell from 4.2 % to 4.1 billion dollars .
analysts had a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion dollars .
the world &apos;s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer is indicating that it has achieved a 45 % increase in the number of aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .
net orders fell by € 83 billion from 83 aircraft to € 26. the order was then adjusted to € 26.4 billion .
the order book in the aerospace industry was down to € 34.5 billion on 30 september and was therefore down from € 31.9 billion on 31 december .
“ in the field of aerospace , the results were in line with our specifications , but the low order intake and market relations overall were disappointing , ” said beaudoin .
sales in the aerospace industry increased by € 2.2 billion to € 2.2 billion .
bombardier , the world &apos;s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this satellite-related sector were almost 11 % up to $ 2.1 billion .
the order book in the transport sector was € 39.4 billion on 30 september and was thus lower than december 31 , 2009 .
the profit margins in the transport sector were reduced by processing problems with some major contracts .
according to the management , the fourth quarter of the company will have new requirements .
in the afternoons trading on thursday , the bombardier share increased by 8.5 percent and was 4.83 canadian dollars , after the announcement was also made that the google index was down from patrick pick .
the brazilian embrace sa , the world &apos;s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer , and bombardiers of the closest rivals , reported on thursday a 10 % increase in the quarterly profit .

cocaine dependent lawyer , who is a drug boss before police investigation warned that he was in prison .
basharat ditta , 42 , gave information to underworld size neil scarborough further .
the lawyer was afraid to have his secret drug addiction shut down .
it was developed by the liverpool crown court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal defender who has a drug baron in front of a large police investigation has been arrested for being afraid of his secret drug addiction .
basharat ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size neil scarborough with sensitive information .
the report prepared by criminalists as “ first class ” is a good example of the spitz name “ bash ” , which was launched in his house in 2011 , after the police had been handed over to scarborough , who was in a member .
officials observed a lack of scarborough ( 32 ) three bows of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in blackburn , lancashire , abbey , while this was with colleagues at a meal .
the investigation broke out that the dishonest and unpopular use of class a drugs was a common occurrence in ditta &apos;s tests .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he tried to disseminate unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of scarborough and one of his partners .
all four suspects were arrested at that time by the police in a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in lancasian .
together with 32 other people , they were later arrested after the police had taken action on a number of home searches heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .
ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals further because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicized .
today , ditta , who is responsible for the forbes soliciators law firm in blackburn , was born at liverpool crown court , after a three-week stay in the law firm .
he gave an interview to the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
the lawyer was transferred to the court after the police had been given the right to investigate scarborough .
two investigators were arrested and sentenced to death .
shortly after he was taken off the drugs , he telephoned scarborough regularly with ditta , who had been in the football stadium of blackburn road .
the lawyer returned to his home , holding a post , and then leaving the court nine communications between the two .
in court it became known that ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of kokain .
ditta was later arrested , staged but deported to cocaine and said that he had been arrested with the alleged deal .
during his arrest , ditta took his wallet and tried to find a number of credit cards .
in the case of police interrogation he stated that he was operating under his private address as well as at the workplace an office and clients would be prosecuted at home for legal matters .
in court it became known that he was key players in the drug trade , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed that he was doing what the investigators were saying about them .
prosecutor anne whyte said : “ a criminal case is not a matter of judgement , but of knowing that the law is not broken . ”
ditta will not be able to escape the abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he is too concerned with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but of a drug dealer who has lost his lawyer with drugs .
part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the leader of the party .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .
he was a member of the police forces , and he was able to continue his criminal activities .
mr ditta has thus brought his profession into disrepute .
he was responsible for the legal affairs of certain clients , in particular scarborough , and he allowed them to be compromised .
ditta pointed out any misconduct of himself and claimed : “ if i were a corrupt lawyer , what i did not , and information to scafee , scarborough , i would be wrong .
but , after the hearing , superintent lee halstead said that the police in lancashire said : ‘ mr ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he was finger .
his cocaine dependence has led to a hopeless compromising and has made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who have entrusted him with providing valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must be the highest standards of integrity and must be able to make their views known to the public .
ditta has lost that trust and has tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .
the serious and organised crime series is a global network of professionals who are committed to the development of a wide range of products and services .
this case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one is guilty of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scarborough &apos;s own work was published in 14 years &apos; imprisonment after he was guilty of conspiracy to become heroin , cocaine , and cannabis .
thirty-five more on drugs trafficking are now in the chamber .
on his website , ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he indicated his dream job .
revolutionary new work of the church music
i have received six motions for resolutions tabled to wind up the celebration of its 160-year existence .
after the great success of the musicals &quot; rock my life &quot; , which the audience at the spring of this year was enthusiastic , the song contest will be the end of the anniversary .
on saturday 26 october , the european parliament will host this extraordinary fair from 19 during the evening fair in st. martinskirche dunningen and on sunday , 26 october .
the so-called deutsche messe with its original title &quot; singing for celebration of the holy opera &quot; is a new event .
the fair will be held at the services of the church , as the client johann philipp neumann intended .
under the direction of hermann schneider , the choir is composed of the group of members of the funkverein frohsinn tennenbronn and noemi lokodi at the organ .
haslach : scepticism is increasingly diverting confidence from the rest of the world .
with the election of the parish council in 2015 , for example , the sailor unit haslach ( se ) will change fundamentally .
there is only one common pfarr community service , for all six parish councils .
in a joint meeting , on saturday , the bodies from hazelnut , hofstetten , mühlenbach , fischerbach , steinach and welschenstein prepared for the changes .
because the fundamental decisions taken by the diocese are not the same as those taken by the diocese , and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .
during the day , it became particularly clear that the scepticism about the new approach is reluctant but increasingly confident .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and future size of the parish church , we are not enough .
regional dean georg schmitt explained how the project was reconceived by the german government to help the seafarers in the archdiocese of freiburg .
the se hamlet is then the church community of the european communities .
it will only be a common parish council , and a temporary committee .
from each parish , at least two elected members are to be represented , in the six parish churches , the local so-called commonwealth teams are formed .
their task will be to make the church and the state more transparent and more transparent .
on the question of the finances of the individual parish community , considerable progress was made in consultation .
the innovations provide that the targeted information is used to cover the costs of the parish .
the liabilities , on the other hand , go to the entire municipality .
it is precisely in view of the large investments that are planned , the obligation of which is then applied to all parishes , that there have been major concerns .
&quot; even in the past , only investments were made that were not carried out by the individual parish families alone .
practical experience with a joint body for five parish groups illustrate the barbarian knights who were the chairman of the board in the sealsorgeunity schutterwald-neurried .
they had committed themselves to the task of &apos; becoming one , five &apos; in 2006 and found that this was not so easy .
the bodies of haslach sailors made their way to the world of warcraft to discuss the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .
the commission &apos;s work will be more concrete in further meetings and will be discussed at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , parish church council michael schöner , from steinach , presented the new logo of the soulsorge unit , which was approved by a significant majority .
in pfullendorf , the electricity is produced more expensive than the electricity produced by the local power stations .
the citizens are shy about the need to move to higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of stadtwerke jörg-arne bias , has said , in front of the south courier , a four-headed pfullendorfer family is 70 to 90 euro extra costs per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in so-called edf surveys of 5.2 % of the total cost of the project .
this levy is paid every october by the four operators of the major power stations in the netherlands .
this figure is the number of people who have been made redundant as a result of the energy change that they will be able to raise through a charge on electricity prices .
the city ’ s pfullendorf municipal works are the last link in this chain .
the supervisory board of the energy company was not sufficiently aware in its forecasts of a higher levy , as jörg-arne bias has pointed out .
now , the specific figures would have to be calculated before the urban units next week inform their customers about the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting to increase from 1 cent plus x , &quot; said the president of the european union , who is more near the 2 cents .
at the traffic lights on permanent red : waiting time , pay attention to the time of waiting .
sometimes an lights are simply not green .
the contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light sign is defective .
what , then , should be done - in red ?
if a person has had enough time to stop at a red light and the intersection is free , he can continue to explain the stop of stuttgart right away .
the waiting time must be &quot; reasonable &quot; .
becker advises at least five minutes to break out before a function breakdown is reported .
if you want to see the red light , you have to be in mind that the road is not suitable for a loss of life .
those who have stayed less than five minutes are waiting for not much time to wait , but becker and point out a decision by the supreme court of haiti .
in the negotiated case , a driver had to leave the car after about three minutes of permanent red and had to stand for a negligent red light .
the traffic lights were not defective , they were jumping a little later on to green .
a driving ban remained in place because of the special situation - the money was not paid .
municipal council is pleased about sound budgets and a solid budget .
whenever there is a local council meeting , it is the council that has the power to act .
the municipal sack in herdwangen-schönach is well filled and debts have been unaware of the administration since 2005 .
the financial year 2012 can also be used as a full success in this respect .
this was not taken into account when presenting the accounts for 2012 .
as andrea rothmund explained , it is the administrative budget with around eur 7.6 million that is over a million euros higher than was planned .
the surplus of the administrative budget also amounts to around eur 1.8 million , which is about eur 1 million .
the fact that the european union has surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenue and the community share of income tax .
the asset budget was again significantly above the planned value .
instead of the eur 1.5 million envisaged , it was eur 2.5 million last year .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher input from the administrative budget , &quot; says rothmund .
as the financial year 2012 saw a reduction in investment than was planned , it is also necessary to reduce the amount of refunds .
overall , the overall reserve was eur 2.1 million reduced to a total of eur 4.9 million now .
mayor ralph gerster thanked the german government for their support in rothmund and their team .
&quot; such a work shakes the balance not just from the sleeve , &quot; praised gerster with a view to the annual accounts .
he and the local councils were delighted to see the good figures .
it may seem paradoxical , but it is these good figures that will soon cost the public dear .
the good financial situation has allowed the community to gain a high level of leverage in the past .
this , in turn , means that more than one subsidy from the country has been cut off , according to gerster .
for these grants from various member states , the commission has already provided the necessary resources .
among other things , cities and communities that receive subsidies must be able to use certain levers .
&quot; the theme of lifting sets we have to look at , as in the years to come there are investments for which we would like to receive subsidies , &quot; gerster announced in this connection .
nagold : hugo wermter has been in the choir for 60 years in the choir of the choir for 60 years .
at the age of 60 he is a singer , and he is a history of the male singer association caecilia almost twice as long as that of the herbsfest , where he is celebrating his solemn birthday .

the honorary singer hubert wermter prepared a special dinner for her honor - wolfgang amadeus mozart &apos;s &quot; bundessong &quot; .
the male singer ’ s association betra also sang classical choral songs such as “ jägerwerben ” by julius wengert , “ far , far away ” by hubert goisern and the folk song .
the song crane salzstetten caused a great deal of trouble with his mixed choir and his group of women - the &quot; impulse gate &quot; - for the women &apos;s quota of the festival .
the joint chorus was abducted by the neapolitan folk &quot; santa lucia &quot; and &quot; eviva espana &quot; from antos gus in foreign languages .
the singer section of the bailing sports club came with &quot; what isch the swing ? &quot; from hans süssmuth and robert papperts &quot; bierlied &quot; .

kenyan press is outraged by controversial media law .
“ we are in a daunting situation , and we must not be surprised what is the position of parliament in the future of simply taking the judicial independence away from it ? ” was indeed the case in the newspaper which published the bill .
“ the law is draconian and very punishable and we refuse to do so , ” cyrus kamau , managing director of the capital group , who also includes capital international .
he said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of the government ” , and restriction on content and advertising would be imposed on kenya ’ s position in the global economy .

concrete plans were put forward two years ago , when the fc announced the chiller ’ s stube in a hereditary lease , a 100 000 euro contribution to the construction of the course and the country received funding of eur 104 000 .
the municipal council decided in october 2012 to take over the remaining 356,000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros , factually excluding klumpp .

vienna airport creates passenger calls from the airport from the time of the flight .
mr maier , please come to gate 24 .
through how this will make it more difficult for the future to find a way out at vienna airport .
much of the speakers are delivered in a way that is not always as noisy as it is .
a more relaxed atmosphere to create is the goal of this innovation .
like airport spokesman peter kleemann on radio vienna , the report follows the vienna airport with the cessation of breakthroughs affecting individuals , an international trend .
for example , the commission has already decided to abandon the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or dubai , for example .
the elimination of these breakthroughs - on average , these are being around 200 personal calls on the part of the speakers in one day - is intended to make it more quiet at the airport in the future .
&quot; it has also become apparent in experience that these individual throughs are relatively little perceived , while at the same time all other information on changed flight ascents or departure times here is a bit lost &quot; , so kleemann said .

the festive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.30 a.m.
the newly designed opschlätt shines with a new café .
one that is for lingering and returning .
one that takes the name to the program .
when déjà vu is called the lexicon , a psychological phenomenon that is reflected in the feeling of being able to create a new situation before or seen .
in case of a visit to the museum of the same name , the hotel will be able to provide you with a free ticket to the rhein-waal university .
after all , the café has a beautiful name for it : a real stay not only followed by a rejuvenation of mind but also a hands-on experience .
because it &apos;s fun and simply beautiful , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
a look into the interior of opschlag 8 gives the viewer a look at the image .
the ultra-modern but not cool café bar ambience looks like a place to feel good .
here , the team spoils the founders mirjam van der stelt and daniel büttner at the top with a variety of coffee and tea specialities .
there are also delicious culinary delights or individually ordered fresh fish and seafood .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already decided to make a statement on the hotel &apos;s website before the opening of the pretty opschlag cafe : in kranenburg they conducted the art lounge .
from moving to kleve to opschlag , the symptoms of the day are the friendly cafe lovers .
not least because of the university .
&quot; while we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; daniel büttner emphasizes .
rather , the two young students here want to address just as much as senior citizens and all age groups in between .
speaking of café-lovers , i have a great time in the city .
the friendly and informal owner of the hotel is behind the coffee pleasure .
enjoy the fragrant hot and cold beer with a glass of wine in a variety of variations .
expressfan was a fan of expresssofan and a fan of the expression .
daniel büttner is more the expresso fan and mirjam van der stelt the cappuccino trinker .
&quot; to this end a baguette - that is my thing &quot; , she tells the nrz .
two events gave it a lot in the bright café .
better said one .
the hafenceslas festival took place outside rather than in the open air - the café déjà vu did not benefit from it .
but there was also the ringelnatz evening .
&quot; nice , successful and funny &quot; , the two 33-year-olds found .
but it is not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps daniel büttner is not a strong supporter either because of the fact that he is a fan of event evenings : &quot; you can &apos;t do it all right &quot; .
and with an event i always speak only those who are interested in the event .
this is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to make the very normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
is this : déjà vu also means reliable and reliable .
as regards the quality of products , which are offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the opposit in kleve .
the road that is more and more turning into a gastronomic mile .
to the delight of many klever , guests from near and far and students who have completed the gastromile and thus also the café déjà vu for themselves .

a day of thanks to the mgv in dinker .
it was the 165th meeting of the foundation to which the mgv friedrich wilhelm dinker was founded in the year .

un proclaims new goals at the fight against poverty .
the united nations is starting to draw up a series of new objectives , which will be able to meet the millennium goals announced twelve years ago .
in the run-up to the un summit on sustainable development , which will take place in rio de janeiro in the evening , australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” that will outstrip the millennium development goals in 2015 .
they were found in the final draft document , which was presented by world leaders .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon declared at the evening at the summit that the time was right to “ override national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to make the european union process more transparent and more transparent .
“ these goals are based on our progress from the millennium development goals , ” says dr. rudolf schumann , ceo of s &amp; t ag , on the development framework after 2015 .
i will spare no effort to ensure that this document , which i am given by the member states , is implemented to strengthen our vision of sustainable development objectives , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
although the sg achim / baden has been in operation for four days , there is still a lot of confusion in the upper league of handball players .
this is where trainer tomasz malmon leaves no doubt .
all remain fully motivated and willing to work with us .
i hope , however , that we can finally win again .
&quot; for i know of course no more how so a victory is tasted &quot; , he expects malmon to be a success experience of his team .
although the third league countries reserve is being financed from fredenbeck at the moment , the commission is still not raising any trees .
many players i have still been in a-jugend training .
therefore , they will be against their ex-coach in particular .
&quot; we must also wait to see if there is any further strengthening from the first , &quot; he explains .
to finally get back to the bottom of the success story , the malmon-team must be more committed to the future than it has been to previous appearances .
above all , in the coverage work and in the switchover game , it was quite hard to do .
the opportunities for exploitation must also definitely be improved .
i therefore hope that my players will be able to play the game out of their heads during the short break .
security concerns in mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures and the opposition from the opposition parties .
thousands of people gathered in the centre of maputo among the vigilant eyes of the statue of samora machel , the founder and first president of mozambique , to help with a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said vanessa de sousa , managing director of an investment company .
fearing the future of the country , it has been raising its business clothes against a t-shirt , entitled “ we demand security ” in portuguese .
for two weeks , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and renamo on a nearly daily basis , which have been one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
renamo was once a notorious rebel group , but was initially a member of the white government .
after the peace treaty of 1992 , it became an opposition party .
analysts think it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-fledged conflict , but they have been following foreign investors and domestic investors with concern .
for the rapidly growing economy , much is at stake , because the discovery of huge gas deposits is a matter of life , not of coal-fired power , off the coast and in the north-west .
the ruling frelimo party , which has been the dominant party since 1975 , and renamo are blaming each other for the tensions .
renamo claims that the government has not yet stopped the recent clashes by holding a referendum on 17 october on its members in the province of sofala , a traditional stronghold renamos .
the attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops were renamed to renamo bases .
the government is giving renamo the blame for the clashes and accusing the organization of attacking soldiers .
president armando guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability .
compared to afp , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that the commission is not going to be able to act as a “ loser ” who is “ all his remaining assets ” .
both frelimo and renamo stress that they are fighting a war .
but the concerns have increased since maastricht and the irish government began to say that the eu is not a viable alternative .
opposite the ft he explained , so he meant that the freebsd agreement was no longer respected .
“ our vision is to restart negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said mazanga .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions , which have been exacerbated by a series of clashes this year .
“ we have two adults men ( guebuza and dhlakama ) , who are the brains .
none of them are well in negotiation and none is willing to take the necessary concessions .
renamo , which is pushing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will not support the local elections in november .
presidential and parliamentary elections are essential for next year .
some commentators have criticised the use of force as an attempt by a wretched movement to make concessions and financial concessions from the government .
renamos ’ election successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , led by a former renamo member , has been losing its election .
mazanga claims that guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term in office begins next year – is the country ’ s democracy .
&quot; he does not want a multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he wants to leave the presidency . &quot; he says .
it is unclear what capacity is renamo , but it has unease .
most of the battles took place in the province of sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of maputo , where the two are located , but beira is the port , the mining station , like rio tinto and the river .
in june , rio cut off a month from using the railways , after renamo had launched an attack on the route .
mazanga replied reluctantly about whether pensions were being used to justify the threat .
renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are going in mozambique not well , ” mazanga said .
the instability has increased the frustration with the government , and the government says fernando lima , head of mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people worried about the government ’ s corruption .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he is the one who should find solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
omar sultane , a demonstrator , said that people wanted to simply have stability .
“ no one interested renamo and frelimo , they just want peace and use the roads again ” , he explained .
children should be able to experience myths and legends as “ models of life . ”
the stories of thor showed that the “ brutal force is not a chance against clever triks , ” and the artus legend demonstrates that the world is important to keep the peace .
many myths are , however , “ far from wild . ”
“ i find it wonderful that in america myths are and folklore already part of the education ” , said he .
i have been doing this for twenty years .
he added that , for authors and teachers , the most “ over-the-counter ” didactic , they would “ be completely shut down ” , because in entertaining stories , the botanical messages would be “ subservient . ”
crossley holland , the beowulf of the anglo-saxon language and author of the penguin book of norse myths and the british book of folk tales is explained : “ man can help .
perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who is responsible for adult life and a author who writes for children is that he is a child .
not everything must be simplified or made to happy end .
it must be subservient , which is manifested in history and not explained .
that is the old story of showing instead of telling .
hansjakob is again coming to freihof to take a walk in freihof .
100 years ago , heinrich hansjakob set his retirement in haslach , and on sunday his last years in the &quot; freihof &quot; were alive .

his criticism of the church was directed by hansjakob just as his concerns about the excesses of the church in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .
in the home town , behind its grave , there is a small church behind the fire near hofstetten .
&quot; a troubled mind had finally found its calm and was heimed forever , &quot; he said at the end of the scene game .

the 2nd us court of appeal declared that the decisions of judge shira apparently had been taken .

coulson used telephone hacking for the check of a tips .
the former news of the word editor , andy cole , continued to use the term “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to create a false tipp about an affair of the then interior minister .
prosecutor andrew edis qc explained to the court in the old bailey , news of the world i had a wrong rumor in may 2005 that he was being arrested by clarke .
the newspaper ordered the private detective glenn mulcaire to release pawlby &apos;s voicemails .
“ the prosecutor ’ s office believes that coulson , who is now the editor of the notw , is no one who is standing in front of the home of people and hopes to seize them on fresh deeds , but one who is happy to be .
he said that emergency use three procedures to dispel stories investigative .
the publisher is personally involved in the third method .
obviously , he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about the phone hacking ?
he argues that , but we say : and whether he is aware of it . ”
rumours about an affair of clarke were first discovered by the feature reporters in the state of the art , when one source , the sexual exploitation of pawlby , was a member of the public .
a band with voicemails from your phone of at least three occasions was released in august 2006 in mulcaires apartment .
the investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective , which they were able to access on pawlby and their sister as “ projects ” .
in the period when the research was in progress , the experts received a number of patents from pawlby .
meanwhile , the us and the former chief editor , neville thurlbeck , and the former reporter , james weattherup , supervised the surveillance of pawlby ’ s movements .
on 18 june 2005 , coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ i have a story , which we will release tomorrow .
edis explained , coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities , such as the former interior minister david blunkett .
the jurors heard on thursday , that cole was in the room , because of an affair with a married woman , and that she was not allowed to work with the woman who was accused .
coulson and brooks argue that they should be confronted with others .

gechingen : no absolute protection possible .
&quot; we want to get the inhabitants involved in the planning at an early stage , &quot; opened mayor jens häußler the civic information event on flood protection concept in gechingen .
around 80 participants were involved in the municipal hall to look at the planned measures .
hassler made it clear : &quot; the ultimate decisions take the members of the municipal council . &quot;
the floods that were chingeing on 15 may 2009 , unprepared met , was a dramatic event .
a river region study was carried out with the neighbouring community of aidlingen .
&quot; the protection of as many cultivated plots as possible is the goal &quot; , he added .
the underlying concept is the planning of protection against a weather service statistic every 100 years .
climate change is caused by a 15 % reduction in the price of the product .
in professional circles , this is explained by &quot; hq 100aklima &quot; .
the water masses that were produced in gechingen in 2009 caused considerable damage were not in keeping with a 1000-year flood .
&quot; to provide absolute protection is not there , but a relative improvement can be achieved &quot; , he added .
in order to protect hq 100aklima , you must have a valid hq 10000aklima in gechingen , where the community has a total of around 70 percent of the state subsidies .
hähler pointed out , however , that it is only the promotion if a total concept is implemented .
i would like to remind the community of the citizens &apos; participation in this .
a complex and complex design and development process is not necessarily the best way to achieve this .
at best , 2016 could begin with implementation .
among other things , the concept of protection , which was adopted in the municipal council last week ( we have been told ) , provides for local measures in the flow of river irm from the parent ’ s valley .
following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the member states used the opportunity to express their concerns .
among other things , it has been questioned why not more dams and rear-basins are planned to protect the place .
gregor kühn , specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office wald and corbe from hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it was the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired result .
i would also like to say that the most economical solution , joachim wald von wald and corbe , have to be found .
there was discontent with the council &apos;s members &apos; entrants , who were even able to keep on being under a congestion from the channel network , even in normal storms .
the problem is not known in the administration , and the first steps have already been taken .
hähler , however , pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are others than for the high-water protection and this is not missing .
the community is obliged to use the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regeneration can be achieved .
the sewage channels larger to dimensioning would save millions of lives .
the most common cause of the injury was the injury of the german army during the war of 1883 .
in the early afternoon on friday , the road 44 near revensdorf will take two drivers to a frontal collision .
the police blocked the street immediately , but could not get to the accident first little .
however , there are various testimonies that have only been evaluated .
it is clear that the 19 year old steering man of a vw golf is moving towards revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from gettorf has been working with her hyundai .
both vehicles clashed , with the woman having been so hard hit that she was unable to get the fire department to work for about half an hour .
the real cause of the accident was unresolved .
both devastated came to nearby hospitals .
the track was left for about two hours .
it could be given to the dostoevsky of the united states .
philip k. dick was a god-looking , a memorial to metaphysicist , his novels and stories have also written something serial .
the fact that the two countries are not involved in the same process is astonishing : the technical eyes , beard , the high forehead .
and so , as fjodor m. dostojewski , with his massive oeuvre as founder and apologist of the russian soul , is to understand , philip k. dick is read as american prophet .
some titles are available in the heyne publishing house , the haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives sold two thousand and one .
dick explains america - the realm of breathtaking technological progress , coupled with parallel processes and a wealth of security .
dick had a great experience in god , his late books read like a mixture of revelation of john and a computer game .
perhaps he was crazy , had drugs to his brain , and he was a good friend .
he has captured , early on , that the machines divinities are .
he wrote a theology of the computer and asked whether he could have a human being different from a machine , the creator of his creator .
that is the blade runner game .
killing .
a master of science fiction .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have filmmakers such as ridley scott , paul verhoeven and steven spielberg inspired him .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &apos; minority reportation &apos; is from 2005 .
there is a question of the principle of pre-crime .
in dicks world , which is the one that is like our shocking , mutants look to the future - and the police are taking action .
&quot; we collect individuals , who are not subject to any law , &quot; says the chief of the authority .
&quot; we are snubbing us before you can commit a violent crime , &quot; he said .
and : &quot; in our society there are no serious criminals , for which we have a criminal prosecutor full of pesudo-criminals , &quot; they read time flows .
they assume that worst weather can happen , and prevent the state of the criminals from falling into line .
dicks narrative works like the blueprint for anti-terrorist action .
antization of the attack : this is how obama ’ s drone philosophy and philosophy works .
but dicks story is not yet finished .
the police chief denounces the fact that there are no separation of powers .
then the overwatcher will be monitored and a future criminal supervised .
the system is revolving around .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it invents its own prerequisites .
does the user accept any errors and sacrifices , but also builds on them .
the system creates the danger that it will combat .
philip k. dick read is always saying that the truth is closer to the truth .
the hotel is very close to the city centre and the train station .

james clapper , us secretary of state of national intelligence , has insisted in september that the us government should not be allowed to use foreign gaming to control the us .
but since edward snowden , who was elected whistleblower , the world ’ s first whistleblower , began publishing his fillhorn to us intelligence about surveillance , european governments and businesses have been unaware of .
reports that the american national security agency has been using the brazilian oil company petroba-bas to force the country to withdraw data from american cloud suppliers , including google and yahoo .
the barrel of overflow brought the revelation that chancellor angela merkel ’ s phone was intertwined , possibly for ten years .

i believe it is conceivable that these data could be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oliver grün , president of bitmi , the small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us has now set an almost as great a risk as china when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , such a survey that was published in july by the advisory group .

cloud computing is a great change .
according to a study conducted by cloud security alliance , one of the trading institutions , the united states has been warned of the negative effects of the global financial crisis following the revelations of the us data mining activities with prism .
jim snabe , deputy chief executive officer of sap , says : “ we see a new question of customers , who are facing it a year ago .

that economic espionage is not surprising .
that has always been the case .
“ it was many years a topic and has become a very important topic in the current discussion , ” says kurt bock , chairman of the chemical company basf .
americans spy us on commercial grounds and industrially , and they are not .

in large companies , employees have been a part of the company for a long time , that the use of a free usb stick on a trade fair or the unguarded leak of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable to say the least .

in germany , many of these companies are global leaders in their niche markets .

“ they are convinced that their son was murdered , ” he explained , “ the reason for his death was that he was a lawyer of kenneth and jacquelyn johnson .
they would never have believed that he was dead .
“ they believe that the best way to avoid logic is to use the power of the laws of physics as well as the common sense of the word . ”
rather , they are convinced that the truth will be concealed to protect the person or person who is responsible for the death of their son .
&quot; her son went to learn to school and came to the body bag . &quot; she commented .
us prosecutor michael moore said on thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of johnson , as a number of important questions remain unresolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death due to a crime ?
the moore explained at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i follow the facts in which direction you are going .
my aim is to tell the truth .
“ i represent the view that a sufficient number of the necessary basic principles for formal identification is in place , ” he said .
moore explained to reporters who were starting to use autopsy to suggest that they were johnson ’ s fault for the consequences of a “ position-related stifling . ”
a second autopsy , however , has caused another death , moore argues .
“ there are a number of questions that need answers or confirmation ” , said mr. kabul .
moore added that if there is sufficient evidence to justify the criminal investigation , or civil liability , he would be able to do so .
a representative of the authority of the county sheriff was on our question on thursday .
a dish in southern georgia ordered the death of the russian army on wednesday .
the parents of the teenager said they had hoped that the video recordings would reveal that the child had died .
cdc publish allergy sufferers for schools and schools .
on wednesday , the commission published a report on the activities of the european union in the field of disease control and prevention .
these are the first such directives that the us administration has issued .
one in 20 children in the united states has now become a food allergy .
the spread of food allergies among children has , according to the cdc , increased 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines provide information for schools , which are registered with the teacher and the staff for food allergies .
it is also recommended that schools of epinephrin be able to take part in the training - the car injection of the epipen brand is used most often - to prevent potentially fatal oversensitivity reaction .
the legislators in the states recently announced the rules that would allow schools to become epinephin more easily .
the report also lists typical cases of symptoms , which are caused by children who are in allergy to the disease .
children may say : “ it feels like they are being born on my tongue . ”
parents of intersexual children can be “ sex vague ” , but they can choose “ sex vague ” .
germany is the first european nation in which a third sex is responsible for children .
newborn children are no longer rigid male , or female , and they are no longer able to be born .
under the new law , parents do not have to pay any more for sex for such children , but can be “ undetermined ” or “ not defined ” on birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reduce the pressure of parents to not allow them to take hasty decisions on operational activities for a gender violence .
an intersexual person said , according to bbc years later , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i maintain the flickwork that is being done by doctors , but i am not going to be able to do so .
it is estimated that one in 2 000 children in the eu comes to europe every year as neither young nor as girls .
they are among the intersexual , a group that is among the diagnoses of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( dsd ) .
valais simpson may have been intersexually .
understanding gender equality is a key issue in the process of developing a new approach , but most experts in the us advise that we should not use the best available information on gender allocation .
the new york psychiatrist dr. jack drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new german law “ blade after a good thing ” .
intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .
“ some people have life-threatening illnesses that cause a surgical intervention .
you can only accept gender assignment without surgery and then see how the identity will develop .
the scientific data on how a child can even have a gender identity is not very clear .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret that people are homosexual .
a report to the european commission in 2000 indicated that the european union must promote intersexual human beings from transsexuals or transgender violence .
these characteristics were shown in post-ranking sexual characteristics , and in the form of muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primarily in sexual relations , and in the form of reproduction .
the report also gives an overview of discrimination , which has been committed by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life .
not with gender , but with the same sex , now have a special camp .
it is now the case in australia and nepal for adults to have access to official documents male , female or “ third sex ” .
in june , australian norrie may welby ( 52 ) was the first “ gender-free ” person worldwide to be recognized after a court ruled that a lifelong “ undefined ” gender status was maintained .
german cards are valid for a maximum of 3 months in addition to m and w , x for intersexuell , according to the ministry of the interior .
in the neighbouring france , gender issues are still the subject of controversy , such as a news report on france 24 .
in 2011 , dozens of french members of the strictly catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender-theory ” of schoolbooks should be removed .
the u.s. website catholic online has also opted out of the german law , on the grounds that “ if the world is in a new state , where the gender is a decision , it is a sexual activity but not . ”
the mother of a newborn from maryland explained to baby zone , she catches it better to have babies at the birth of a sex .
“ the parent carrier is a very important part of the family ’ s life even without further restrictions , especially when you are familiar with the sex of your child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .
children need stability and security .
historically , children who were born with both male and female parents were not treated as children .
ten years ago , the commission ’ s medical profession considered gender to be something that could be extinguished and then rebuilt .
but the ethics of a surgery are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors are also wrong to seek out the ethical basis of the operation .
“ in the middle of the 20th century , one was called , psychiatric emergency , ” said drescher .
if such a child was born , then it was not the psychiatrists who were called , but the surgeons .
the prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals dates back to dr. john money of the johns hopkins university .
he shaped the term “ gender ” and the concept of “ gender identity ” was argued , and social and environmental stimuli – like parents invented a child – were interacting with genes and hormones of a child and influencing them .
but , in a report entitled “ john / joan ” , the us government ’ s 1966 case has been described as controversial .
he advised the parents of a boy whose penis was killed in a botched crop .
money was a very important example of this case , as a successful example of conversion , but it was not .
when the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex .
with 38 but he did commit suicide .
according to drescher , there are still doctors who use this model .
but , in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the internet , survivors of these sex operations to the public have come to the attention of “ not happy with the outcome . ”
for example , jim bruce , a 36 year old author from montana who worked with xy-male chromosomes , was a young author who had ambiguous genitalia .
the doctors agreed that the situation was not as clear as it was , or was not , a large clitoris or a small penis .
so his external organ and the court ’ s hoden were removed shortly after the birth in 1976 , and he was taken to power as a girl .
at the age of 12 he was given female hormones .
“ i knew that the world was not a girl , ” he explained to abcnews.com that he was a girl of the same name , abcnews.com , who was a member of the abcnews.com group .
i was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should have a vaginal plastic .
but , as he is depressed and knew that he was doing something wrong , he was demanding that the government ’ s medical records be .
what he found was shocking , and i was not able to see what he was doing .
i was born in the middle of my birth – and nobody gave me that .
bruce was played with a dsd , through which his body did not have enough testosterone to develop genitals .
after telling the truth , he changed his mind to the male front .
the operation has made it infertile .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to be able to use intersexual humans as normal .
but anne tamar-mattis , managing director of the company based in california , is not a member of the european union .
“ many activists are worried that the german decision will encourage parents to take quick decisions and to give the child a non-fixed ‘ allocation ’ , ” she explained .
we fear that the european union will be able to intervene .
we think it would be better to leave male or female members of the family to work together .
but we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .
tamar-mattis said that her organisation supports the australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as the third sex ” .
“ adults should be able to develop their own decisions about their legal sex .
the german law is about the allocation of the funds for the birth of children .
this is not a fight to which little children can be forced at this time .
if you are adult , you can have your own body decide .
but dr. arlene baratz , a brustradiologist from pittsburg , who was a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder , and who had hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that this is german .
katie , the daughter of baratz , was killed with male chromosomes .
because of the reception defect of the target cells for testosterone katie developed female characteristics that were not yet available .
it has a vagina , but no uterus and no oocytes .
today katie 29 and married the other two , she works on the university of pennsylvania .
it is infertile , but it hopes to be replaced by adoption or temporary agency .
“ the law gives parents room to decide , which means that they do not have to take decisions hurriedly , ” said baratz .
it gives you the time to test different tests and to do things and gives you the time to test them .
in this way , everything is in order – you pull the child big and loves it .
the hotel is located in a quiet area , close to the city centre .
and you don &apos;t have to rush to do an operation that is no longer undone .
“ this includes children in the decision .
in the end , the child decides on the sex that fits better with him – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to be able to make their own decisions .
unknown offenders injure girls by shot from car , car , or by car .
unknown persons have been killed at shots from a car for 12 years in saxony-anhalt .
the perpetrators had a meeting in gene on thursday evening with a air pressure weapon on a group of children who were killed .
the commission told the police in burg that .
the girl is easy on the left wade was hurt .
rescue forces broke the girl , and the hospital was closed .
the shot came from a small car that was attached to a group of six children .
witnesses saw two people in the car sitting .
the perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .
a disc crumbled .
then they assumed that .
the police charged the police with investigating the crime on friday .
to date , the police inspectorate kempten can count on a quiet halloween night .
the officials were only twice eggs , and the commission has not yet taken them on board .
since homeowners do this in time and the eierst is the most distant one , no material damage should have arisen .
furthermore , in the municipal area , some sylvester böller were also ignited , but there is no material damage here either .
a local living in the bishop friendly village path melted that the village was not equipped with a knock on the car and its wheel-fitting was turned off .
until the arrival of the police , the man has his rack-ornamental blades found in immediate vicinity , so the police are not required to continue working .
living with future prospects , the new generation of living conditions , the new generation of living conditions and the new generation of the new generation of the new generation of the generation of our new generation of young people .
in fact , waltraud ries lives in a dreamlike atmosphere .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and also not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you are not afraid of spiders ? &quot; asks waltraud ries and shows on a fat spinning on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult that is in stuttgart .
the reason is not a phobia of spines , but a concern to be able to see the many steps to the house and the apartment at an old age , explains them .
moreover , since a meniscus operation , the middle fifties have seen a significant increase in the number of women in the european union , who are suffering from handicap .
recently , a book by her appeared , for example , on the subject of &apos; happy living in old age - what form of housing is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;our apartment is the best example of what happened in old age &apos; , begins with a refreshing and pleasant experience .
when they were elected more than 20 years ago with their husband in the maisonette apartment , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with the middle fifty , waltraud ries thinks differently about it .
however , she also knows that she is one of the few people who has even considered the issue of &apos; housing in old age &apos; .
most of them are pushing it out as long as it is .
old people are always only the others &apos; , she says schmunzelnd .
only when the suffering pressure really is great do i make a thought .
&apos;then it can be too late . &apos;
in her book , interior architect puts 17 home models for a self-determined living in the old age .
&apos;what kind of home you choose is always a personal choice . &apos;
d i e solution there is not for the age .
even those who are not sure about the retirement home in tuscany or brittany should be aware that the european union is also a sick person .
and : &apos; without good knowledge of the national language , you will also be able to combine in the dolce vita , &apos; the specialist book author of those who wish to be excluded .
among their models are classic models of care for children , alternative forms of living , or the often quoted retirement age .
at age everyone has his ticks and his necks and is doing his own tricks and doing something about them .
&apos;for me , such a community would be nothing &apos; , she says , with an eye catcher .
it is not like a student group who is looking for a shared bathroom and a kitchen .
&apos;at age you just need to retreat rooms &apos; , so you can see them .
the fact that a senior residential community can still function is something that the book author still does not want to exclude .
this should be done differently , however , than in the classical student writing .
and sometimes you just want to relax . &apos;
this is the opinion that she is in no way alone in the capital of the country .
&apos;most of the old people in stuttgart want to stay there until they are in their own home &apos; is also the experience of theresa rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the provincial capital .
your department advises people around the subject of &apos; older people &apos; .
that is why it is precisely elderly people who often find it difficult and difficult to accept restrictions , just to stay in their usual environment .
there are many possibilities today to visit the house or the apartment barrierefrei .
ries recommends all users to contact the rs-232 for a reconfiguration of their home or home .
today , there is also a new system for the rebuilding of the old age .
even in the rental apartment let the one or other realizes , and if there is only the toilet seat increase , the apartment will clarify the details .
but not always is the existing apartment suitable for the elderly and thus accessible .
this experience has been passed on to waltraud ries .
although it is possible to find a stairlift inside the apartment , which is also paved with stairs to the residential areas .
it will continue to seek out the ideal object for itself and your husband .
before moving , the camera greets you more than before the spinning on your home door .
the us wants to further prosecute snowden , but the us wants to continue prosecuting snowden .
the us has changed its position on the former us intelligence officer edward snowden .
he will continue to be accused of using secret information unauthorised .
therefore , he must be in the us subject to a criminal procedure , said the us secretary of state , that jennifer psaki , was in washington .
the recent statements by snowden and the other news would not change that either .
previously , the german green politician hans-christian ströbele had a meeting with snowden in moscow , where he was invited to join the us in order not to continue threatening him with punishment .
psaki stressed that there is a need for a strong response to the anti-democratic sentiments of a parliamentarian , not a german member of the government .
intelligence services are now being replaced by edward snowden , who is in fact willing to talk to the german authorities .
first , however , he wants to clarify his situation .
the report presented by the united states has done so by the former nsa staff in an unaddressed letter , which the founder of the green party , hans-christian ströbele , sent to the united states on friday after a meeting with snowden .
the letter has been sent after a debate that was widely distributed by ströbele :
the competent authorities must be notified of any complaints to the competent authorities .
i was asked to give you a brief reply regarding your investigation into mass surveillance .
i am edward joseph , the son of the lord of the rings , and i was previously contracted or directly appointed as technical expert at the national security agency ( nsa ) , the central intelligence agency .
in my work in these institutions , i have seen systematic violations of the law of my government , which have left me morally obliged to act .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i faced a serious and persistent scepticism that forced me to leave my family and my home .
i live in exile and enjoy the best time in the world for temporary asylum , which the russian federation has granted me under international law .
i am encouraged by the response from the commissioner to my political action , both in the united states and elsewhere .
citizens around the world and high officials are also very much in favour of the european union &apos;s disclosures .
this spy dehubris was a source of many proposals for new laws and directives , which were based on the previously hidden principles of abuse of public confidence .
the benefits for society from these gained data are not only recognised by the state , but also by the public and private sectors , the risks taken into account have been significantly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is treating dissent as a breach of trust and striving to promote political expression .
nevertheless , to tell the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the government of the united states , with the support of the international community , will take this abhorrent position .
i hope that , when the difficulties of these humanitarian situations are resolved , i will be able to give my support to the responsible implementation of the experts &apos; report on the humanitarian situation in the media .
i look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .
edward snowden testified to his work by hans-christian ströbele and his team .
kindergarten has found a private buyer .
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says winterlingen &apos;s mayor michael maier .
the former kindergarten in the gartenstraße has sold the commune to a private person .
the sale was approved by the municipal council in its recent meeting in the non-public part .
the building changed its owner to a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , emphasizes maier .
the budget has been eur 100 000 .
not yet clear how the new owner of the former child ’ s garden will be used .
the mayor is right that winter liners should take responsibility for the building before winter on someone else .
&quot; this effort is now gone &quot; , maier is pleased .

obama-campaign report considered , biden by hillary clinton , to be a substitute for hillary clinton .
the closest advisers of president barack obama have , in secret , considered inviting vice-president joe biden to the european parliament in the 2012 election campaign by hillary clinton , according to the new york times .
the revelation is the considerable number of the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by mark halperin and john heilemann about the election campaign in 2012 , “ double down ” .
times is a unique example of the same name that will be published soon .
according to jonathan martin , national correspondent of the times , the country ’ s book is thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading campaign and white house employees to establish a “ green ” , in particular the former white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly controlled process , which was not always easy to understand .
only half a dozen of endemic advisers from the president – including daley , the former campaign leader obama , jim messina , and the former chief of adviser to the white house , david axelrod and david david david david .
in double down , the “ double down ” is claimed to have led the effort to create a biden despite her “ close relationship ” with the bees .
in an interview with martin , the dalie confirmed that the government was actually considering how to make biden by clinton .
“ i expressed a whole series of things that could be considered , ” he said .
we must remember that the european council president at that time had terrible poll values , so that the people of europe thought : ‘ for god ’ , what are we doing ? ’
while daley was the first to be treated as a &quot; due care &quot; , martin told anderson cooper of cnn that during the campaign for the re-election of the child , considerable effort was made to find out if a child was a child .
“ in campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups , when one does not seriously think about something ” , he explained on ac360 .
however , it is not clear whether obama knew that he would be able to exchange intelligence and intelligence .
martin said to cnn that he had asked daley whether his damaler boss had been informed of the possible change .
although there is a statement by daley that he does not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware of ” , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew of it .
martin added that the “ double down ” is not a definitive answer to the question : what is the political song ?
cooper asked martin if he was seriously thinking of obama having nothing to learn from the studies on how he could be a beekeeper in the election .
“ possible ” , replied martin .
what happens on my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
has the design of the internet service e-mail been similar to the conventional mail system technically the secret of the letter ?
the design of the early internet services focused on the need to make communication possible .
therefore , the basic technical protocols did not ensure that a stable and stable foundation for a hearing protection letter was laid .
therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; is interested in &quot; benni &quot; send an email to the computers of the two are then directly connected ?
the email program or browser of anna schickt sends the mail to the mail server in the first step of the service provider .
if you are a gmail account , for example , the google .
this mail server sends the content to the provider , the user benni uses .
on the route , the mail can be sent via several other servers on the internet .
bennie can then check the content with his provider .
if conventional e-mails are sent through the network , the user can see the message .
most mail will be sent multiple times by software robots .
the provider of the sender will be charged for checking whether the mail is a malicious program .
the receiver systems use a usb port to connect to the computer .
moreover , the providers check whether they are a ridiculous and unwanted donation .
have the robots still another task ?
in systems such as gmail , the robot also determines the information that google has to provide for context advertising .
if anna and benni are sent via gmail to your next holiday destination , google may provide links to holiday information .
read also unknown people to read the emails ?
the probability that unauthorized persons have received an email is very high .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies , administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement agencies and secret services have also been given legal opportunities to send e-mails or to take note of them .
in addition , possible illegal spelling actions are to be added .
is it possible to send e-mails against reading ?
with encryption according to the openpgp standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against read .
with a high technical effort it is also possible to use the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that not even the user can easily be identified who is connected with whom .
how important are yahoo and google on the e-mail market in germany ?
the main private ones are the mail boxes of yahoo and google , according to an investigation by convios consulting in august 2013 , only a subordinate role .
while the shares of yahoo-mail were last dropped , gmail was able to significantly increase gmail .
mother in the forest is missing and pension kassives the old man .
when his bettered mother died , he forged a man from wolfsburg to build a plan .
he buried the dead in a forest - and kassed the dead .
to continue to pay pensions and care money , we have to make sure that a 67 year old wolf burger has lost his mother &apos;s dead after investigating the police in the forest .
first of all , he has condemned the death of the 89-year-olds , then he has spent the money for more than one and a half years .
now the 67-year-old has to be held responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on friday .
so the commission ’ s man hid the woman in a forest near helmstedt .
suspected was the man already in may : at that time , the police had to pay for the people in need of care .
the investigators told me that the pensioner , his mother was travelling to spain .
because officials are not aware of this , they have shown that they are doing so .
it was revealed that the two countries had been in the process of living in a common flat for more than 15 years and he had last looked after them .
the 67-year-old eventually died his mother , and he was released from prison .
an obsession arose according to the police , no evidence of a capital crime .
want to see ice cream in the dark ?
a british entrepreneur has the first in the dark shining eis. the company has developed a new type of coating with the help of paints .
charlie francis was the curator of the fluorescent properties of marine animals .
the idea was born after he had completed a research on torments .
the ice cream reacts to the skin with the tongue , which makes the ph in the protein higher and the light is more effective .
chris explains that the menu ice was responsive to the warmth in his mouth and glows – the more you can lick , the brighter it becomes .
charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ lick me i &apos;m delicious ” , has been saying : “ the product is incredible .
the egg is used in the ice cream to respond to the tongue in a neutral ph-value .
if the mouth is the protein warms , the blood pressure increases .
we have seen it in recent months , and it has appeared to us ideal to make it halloween on the market .
it is probably the most expensive ice cream i ever made .
each ball costs me about 140 pounds .
but for this it tastes delicious .
charlie ’ s experimental company based in bristol is famous for its unconventional and elegant design .
but his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .
he says : ‘ i would like to see an invisible ice cream . ’
this is , in itself , impossible because of the light refraction caused by the ice crystals .
the ice cream uses fluorescent properties of a torn which are used by chinese scientists to produce artificially .
the tsv morsum is the winner of the european championship after six days of play , and it is still not at all a point in the handball league .
it is now precisely the time for the team at ingo ehler to join the derby against the tsv daverden , who was the winner last weekend of his first victory .
with this game begins the season new for us .
&quot; i hope that we can finally get our heads off the ground &quot; , ehler &apos;s behavior is optimistic .
he finally got a good idea , except for the injured hendrik blohme , his complete kader .
in the same way , davern relies on tempo game .
we must therefore increase our error rate .
first and foremost , however , we must be careful to increase the coverage , which is not a safe one at the last .
the hotel is located in the heart of the city , close to the famous shopping street , the famous &quot; kolping square &quot; and the &quot; kolkata &quot; .
the game was of course a house number .
that is why we are far from being the favourite , because in the derby everything can always happen .
i would , however , like to add that panitz is now going to post in morsum to start a series .
jan-malt jodat is missing .
for this , the a-jugendliche joost windßuß , who is a member of the a-jugendligist hc bremen , is taking part in the season debut .
anyone who plays in such a game is not to be at home .
halloween 2013 : in numbers 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 7 : 30 , the number of the new year ’ s eve : the world ’ s largest news , the world ’ s largest news channel , is now available in the world .
when i was small , halloween had something magical .
my sister and i were allowed to have candles , to stay late and to prepare for our neighborhood .
today i am more like a halloween muffle .
in the last two years , i have not declared myself willing to go from my home to sweets , and i will probably not be able to do so this year either .
but , according to statistics , i am a black sheep , which halloween is concerned .
the majority of americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate this year halloween and spend a total of 6.9 billion dollars on southern african sweets , costumes , and decorations .
one thing that i would like to focus on every halloween then is the fact that the trend values are .
the costumes are sold about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion issued us dollars .
this year , the most exciting unleashing items are the last cry .
women do not have to be dressed in sexy clothes anymore , they can now also enjoy tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .
as for men , i expect a lot of zombies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet that the daft punk world tour will be a success .
according to google , the most sought encodings zodiac are the batman , pirates and hexen .
i suspect it is not a bad thing of tradition .
last year we adopted our dogs and we were able to make a good impression on them not alone .
indeed , americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the nrf .
these are a lot of hot dogs , but they are not .
as far as sweets are concerned , we are not insignificant .
americans will be spending $ 1.9 billion this year , according to the nielsen company .
these are about eur 270 million in chocolate drinks .
so good news for the us department of commerce 41 million people who are struggling with the slogan “ sweet or sour ” through the neighborhoods .
in fact , we will have to import over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to consume is sugar sweet candy corn ; yet we are going to import 15 million kilograms of it by halloween , according to the national association of confectionery manufacturers .
these are about nine billion corn grains .
it is a mystery that i still do not have the capacity to resolve .
nothing more can be heard at halloween than houses where there are spukt .
you have great names like “ terror ” , “ the death of the wall ” , and i think that this is a real prison , “ howl-o-scream ” and “ the house of shock ” .
there are indeed 1,200 officially recognised spukhäuser in the united states , which receives $ 500 million .
but let us finally move to the shortest bite .
charlie brown made us a great player with the big pumpkin when we were children , and the cutting of a shorter lantern is like decorating christmas tree .
fortunately , the “ baby in the shortest possible time ” trend began only last year thanks to peintest , so most of us have grown up with it to make the pumpkin and not , in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 106 million on shorter bills , according to the us census bureau .
the shorter lantern , which slowly turns into the front garden , is probably from illinois , where this year 245 million kilograms of shortwave were harvested .

housing fire in helmbrecht : rescue services , but also the supply of boiled corpses , which are not in the pipeline , are at risk of burnt .
the fire brigade had to leave the city late on thursday evening in helmbrecht .
a three-family house in the district of hof begins at night to fire on friday .
the rescue forces are facing a tasting of the body , which is not a problem .
rescue forces have played a major role in a fire in helmbrecht .
whether it is a resident handle , is still unclear how a speaker of the police in bayreuth said .
in the late thursday evening , the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy had burned down on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire brigade entered , the two flames already hit out of a window .
the forces were sent to the home and found the corpse in a room .
this and another room burned out completely .
the entire ground floor has been damaged .
all other residents were killed during the fire .
the building was not ready for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was not clear at first .
germany &apos;s largest national church has an offensive capacity .
background is a possible parish priest &apos;s shortage : the evangelis-lutheran church hannover , founded in 1887 , is expected to increase its number of parish members .
for young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said pastor mathis burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .
it is attractive to increase the working and daily working life itself .
with burfias , the state church has for the first time set up a pastor on a full site to appoint young people for the study of theology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study , theology and the arts .
burfias is doing this in the process of deconstructing : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is loudly &quot; .
the calvados are the most beautiful and most beautiful places in the world .
i am the lord of my calendar and i can present my priorities there where there is an important point of view for me .
pastors could be considered as sailors very close to the people .
she earned so much as teachers and could do well to live from it .
certainly , in the free economy , more is paid , but theologians would have a safe employer .
that is something that will help young people today who are not only about career but also about a sinner filled work.
according to the national church , which has three quarters of lower saxony , the number of deaths in the country is currently around 60 per year .
at the same time , some 40 students of a theology studies begin their vikariat .
in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin , emsland or the wendland , it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future .
burfias wants to promote , among other things , student days for young people and also to invite prominent people to study theology .
the theology studies offer a broad training .
it is even possible to become the president of the federal republic .

fire brigade to rescue a bitch is called , which has been 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock .
cockerspaniel-bitnin ruby was after a smaller road accident .
three days later , she was taken by a walker in the quarry in her uneasy location .
fire brigades rocked on the rock wall and saved the dog .
the fire brigade managed to get a bitch in safety .
the nine months old cockerspaniel-bitch ruby was killed after a road accident on sunday afternoon .
scott alderson , 25 , and his friends , beecky hall , 20 , who were denied the dog , came to the quarry flappit in denholme , west yorkshire to ruby again .
they had desperately sought their missing children , and they were not able to help .
about about 14 : 15 pm on wednesday saw a spazier watching the movie .
the technical rescue team is working on the new cleckheaton fire station .
andy clayton , specialist in technical rescue services , has been working on the new system for the first time in a dangerous situation .
it was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from top and the ground .
she did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .
but now it is doing well .
it subsequently took a few dogs and was then taken to the hospital .
this was a rather unusual use .
the fact that the dog is discovered is a incredible experience .
peter lau , specialist in technical rescue services , has been working on the project “ ruby had a huge problem .
there was the possibility that they would be very seriously injured or worse .
ruby was born in the uk , where he was born in the united states .
becky hall from hailefax , west yorkshire said : “ at the rescue , watching was bearable .
i could not believe that they were really up there .
it was wonderful to see you back in the poor .
the veterinarian explained that if exhaustion is too large and they have collapsed , it would probably have crashed .
the fire brigades have done a great job .
it was really courageous to do what you did .
we are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scott alderson from keithley added that the “ we had been afraid that they would fall . ”
the fire brigades were great .
i can hardly believe where she was .
mick jagger explains that he has been a kay perry never accused when she was 18 .
an interview with a australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she had been playing as backgrounds singer and was playing jaggers song “ old habits ” .
perry explained that she had to work with the altrocker to evening , and that “ he had baked me when i was 18 ” .
she added : “ the most important thing since a long time ago , and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of hunters , 70 , said on thursday that he was “ categorically opposed to having ever been attempting to approach kay perry ” .
the representative added : “ perhaps she did not discuss it with someone else . ”

george kerevan : european unbundling gives the scots the choice
a new day , a new story of terror about independence .
this time we will be warned that an independent scotland would not be necessary to protect the schengen area .
this provides the keyword for stories and stories about passport controls in berwick and a story of barbed wire .
indeed , in the street hall of the city of strasbourg , reference was made to the possible economic benefits that could be gained by greater freedom of travel in the rest of europe , but this was , as is expected , not included in the headlines .
nor did anyone mention that the eu member states often take their strict rules on themselves .
since scotland is not currently a member of the schengen area , the continued use of the schengen agreement would be just a small concession for brussels in exchange for what we can really expect from the scots .
so really no story .
and one that has already been in the years , that they have already been exposed to a fossil : the first time i have called the “ independence means passport controls ” -ente at least 40 years ago .
a very interesting point is the constant repetition of this ancient story .
why talk of an independent scotland ?
why the london jail against the europe of brussels ?
these are the real european news : the great , after the war , europe &apos;s plan to unite is dead .
the euro crisis has brought the european project officially to a standstill .
throughout the eu , parties are gaining ground , the anti-eu parties are losing the euro as a common currency .
even in germany , the eurosceptic party could not find alternative for germany – founded only this year – almost five million votes in the german federal election in september .
there have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
the current economic crisis , however , is a turning point .
because of the berlin and the european central bank &apos;s strict austerity policies linked to the straitjacket , which the government of each country has invested in by sticking to the single currency , the many people of europe believe that the project is a success .
the crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments ’ taking excessive fiscal deficits – the most recent crisis in greece .
instead , the eurosystem has extended its members to exchange rates , which are not acceptable to german exporters .
without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over germany .
the only way is to cut wages and public spending , and that is to encourage investment in berlin .
behind the current etat and currency problems , there is a deep oscillation of european productivity .
as a result of the regulations laid down by brussels on &apos; green &apos; energy lines – a code for subsidising french farmers and german energy companies on the expense of consumers – the european industry is paying a little more than the united states .
this is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in greenmouth .
all wage fixing in the world protects european petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap american oil .
as a result , a revolt is emerging , especially in france , the former cheerleader of the eu .
after the war , the political elite of france saw the eu as a vehicle for the destruction of the country ’ s economy .
but berlin does not need paris more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed europe ’ s own economic policy , thereby fueling the troubled french economy .
the result : marine le pen ’ s right-wing , eu hostile front national has just launched a decisive re-election , thereby increasing the power of the socialists .
the national front is now the most popular party in france , with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning to the british labour government .
what makes le pen so special with its newly won popularity among the white french workers ?
it wants to hold the eu elections next year to set up an anti-eu , anti-community bloc in the european parliament .
if the anti-eu parties are well represented in these elections – and this is very possible – they will be able to take place for the first time in this block .
this is the point that i would like to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment of the eu and the single currency will lead to the abolition of the euro .
the eu will not disappear , but it will be more like the “ europe of ( sovereign ) states . ”
germany and a few of its satellite economies may be sticking to the euro , but france and southern europe will be forced to withdraw to their own currencies .
i expect the commission to be guided by this project in the hope that it will be able to join the united states .
but washington is not showing growing interest in the pacific region , as the us and japan alone are doing in the atlantic rain .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to create a region of ( ultimately ) small ( england ) that is not a part of england .
or we can put our own economic interests to rest – including , berlin and brussels – in saying what they want to get where they are .
i suspect scotland will be able to play a more loose european union .
cooperation with others , similar to the united states , is not possible in a europe of nations that is not federated .
otherwise , we should consider making it more similar to norway and increasing our economic independence .
the snp government in scotland is a very important partner for the european union , remarkably .
it would be a ridiculous thing for scotland to now opt for independence , just to be able to get a savings policy from berlin and brussels .
early puberty : faster adult growth , and the ability to grow up faster .
afro-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts , as studies show .
physical changes mean not yet directly the puberty of the body , but the physical and mental health of the body .
there is no evidence that the hormones or other chemicals are not responsible .
experts believe that the epidemic of obesity is a trigger of early puberty .
the trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among young people .
the former cnn correspondence was sent to the us by pat etheridge , a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .
if a mother is worried when her daughter is already at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shampoos ?
the annual conference of the paediatrician association american academy of pediatrics will be held this week in orlando , florida , the paediatric endocrine doctor declared dr. paul kaplan .
“ i spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents – usually the problem is not a sign of their being able to quickly recover .
obvious ads of the development , such as growing breasts , shampoos and armpit hair as well as body smell , are more common in girls .
however , there was only a slight shift in the age of menarch ( the first recurrence of the disease ) over the last 40 years .
in the united states , the average age of the population is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .
&quot; if the development of breasts begins , it still takes at least two to three years to get to the menarche , &quot; said kaplowitz , also author of the book &quot; early puberty at girls : the essential adviser .
time is the most accurate test of how the puberty progresses .
it is controversial that what is actually the beginning of puberty is , but it is “ early retirement ” that is needed if breast enlargement is to be accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight .
in most cases , the process slowes down or stagnation .
for faster progress , the us government could allow tests to be carried out by a endikronologist , so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded .
there are treatment methods for delaying early menstrual and early depopulation .
the recommendations for a drug policy or hormonal therapy are based on the principle of age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .
psychosocial aspects are also important .
kaplowitz is reluctant as regards medication , but he admits : “ suppressing the puberty can cause behavioral problems and feelings of girls to mitigate , unlike their old friends .
the other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .
“ they worry about the pregnancy risk , or about how much they can reduce the hygienic side . ”
“ it was a shock , ” a woman remembers , whose daughter was killed ten days after her death .
although there are initial signs and we are talking about menstruation , it was emotional .
she was afraid to say that she was not a member of the european parliament , and she was excited and excited about her school .
there are many widely publicised theories about the causes of early depression .
but there are no conclusive evidence that the us is not able to control hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual health .
boys are coming to the pub like girls .
kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of fetal stem cells .
he supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine years old , which was linked to body fat and the entry into the puberty .
other studies support this conclusion , but it does not include many other factors that could play a role .
in this country , african-american and hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .
there are different explanations for this .
globally , an early puberty of all kinds seems to be influenced by economic conditions , the climate , and the genes .
another mystery : although young people do not know the face and shampoo hair earlier , it is still a trend that leads to a full-fledged earlier puberty .
other doctors on the aap conference are emphasising the complexity of the issue .
the emergence of acne and shamhaar is not the same as the spread of infants and infants .
“ we must be careful how we use the real start of puberty . ”
parents should not hesitate to distance themselves from their paediatrician as to how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you can be a conversation earlier than expected , ” kaplowitz advised .
if you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .
girls who are born early are in need of insurance , which the process is a normal part of life , even if they are born earlier than thought .
jumbo manufacturer strikes in the face of large orders for seat width and seat width , and the manufacturer is arguing against the same rules in the face of large orders for large orders over seat width .
between leading aircraft manufacturers , it is clear that the new technology is not enough to cover the wide range of seats in the tourist class .
the dispute is about the future of the seat , the passport of long flights , the seat width of the passenger class – not always the ones to be dealt with by the airlines most , but this is the stated space .
airbus called for a new fire to be created this week , which will allow for a minimum of 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class .
the debate comes at a time when the aircraft industry is facing the prospect of a new type of aircraft being manufactured .
like the rear part of the aircraft , the aircraft is designed to be rows with nine or ten seats – and the most important factor for the economic results that the new “ mini-” aircraft will bring .
boeing claims that its modernised 777x was a boeing 406 person seated in the tourist class , which had more than 17 inches wide .
airbus declares that the competing version of the a350 will be delivered to 350 passengers in 18 inch widths in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft giants share a common belief that the us is the best place to discuss technical details through advertising .
now airbus is appealing to the dubai airshow where the 777x is equipped with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company posted an ad that marked the beginning of a new ad war .
“ boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turbo-props , ” says airbus sales manager , airbus .
in view of the changing dietary habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not radically changed .
between the early 1970s , when the boeing 747 was the modern long-range journey , the city was given a new name , and the weight of the male average man was increased by between 40 and 49 years .
the waist range of the male average is about 10 % .
airbus says its rival is not in line with a seating concept from the 1950 ’ s , when the average body size of the newly launched “ jet set ” was reduced .
i think that airbus has carried out investigations which have shown that the use of an additional customs duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat will not improve the quality of sleep by 53 % .
boeing is denying the figures of airbus at the seven-million-dollar rate , and says that it is not the manufacturers &apos; discretion to decide how airlines should balance flight tariffs and equipment .
the company also states that according to studies , the experience on the aircraft of more than the seat width is decreasing .
“ it really is about giving airlines flexibility , ” says the rapporteur , who is responsible for the safety of passengers .
you do not want us to dictate to you what you make profitable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
for passengers , it is about more elbows freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be more difficult to find a solution to the problem of sales .
behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with a estimated price of $ 300bn .
how reuters first reported in july that the project is now in its seating layout .
both airbus and boeing have claimed that 20 percent more efficiency per seat is achieved in their latest two-engine long-haul designs and that the market leader in this segment is the 365-seat a320 family .
the statements by boeing on the results depend in part on the fact that the 7777x , with its ten seats per row , is compatible with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .
the increased costs per unit are still too small for the current eu machinery with ten seats per row .
“ boeing quetscht therefore squeezes more seats into his plane to make it more competitive to our products , ” says kevin keniston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row are worth of the 777s indicated that many passengers would choose closer arrangement .
“ eighteen dwarves of seat width would be great for passengers who are not really aware of the fact that , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is not affected by the threat posed by the 777 ” , says mary .
airbus and boeing offer no seats in the european union , but a catalogue of suppliers , from which the airlines can choose which to choose .
the world traveler jet sellers even carry bandwidth .
even if you want to enjoy comfort , the rooms are equipped with jets with high compression rates .
airbus offers an a350 with ten-seater rows , but it has not yet sold , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus has stressed how important it is to make cabins more adaptable and to provide a wide range of seats for some jets .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to disappear , but from the wave of 777x sales .
new anti-nicotine vaccine could help the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine to help the fun of smoking .
a single dose of vaccine could be used to treat mice for life before nicotine addiction .
before testing humans , further tests are needed , which is still a few years away , but professor ronald crystal of the weill cornell medical college has been working in new york to prepare the first results .
“ we are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will bring millions of smokers to the world to try to stop smoking while taking all the drugs available on the market .
the new vaccine contains a harmless virus that is so modified that it will not affect the genetic information on the production of nicotine crops .
the virus infected selectively the liver cells , which then cause a constant flow of antibodies and are then produced .
the antibodies jaen the nikotin molecules and the blood .
in attempts , vaccinated mice kept the animals from being fed and then left the animal to feed the normal activity level .
mice without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out ” , the researchers declared , a sign that the nicotine would reach its brain .
the experiments are published in the science translation journal .
earlier tobacco vaccines suggested that the disease could be prevented , and that is why the disease was not so widespread .
vaccinations had to be used to maintain the antibody peel .
but the costs of the new vaccine are probably much lower than they are , because it transforms liver cells into antibodies .
as professor crystal said , the european union could be a source of vaccine for people who are in a safe position to be administered to children before they are tempted to take a cigarette .
but it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .
“ you then know : if you start to smoke again , you feel very uncomfortable because of nicotine vaccine .
british scientists have said that the results are interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .
tripodi denies that from obeid influenced by the fact that he was born to obeid , he was a man of the same name .
the former minister of the laboratory party joe tripodi from new somalia , who is now being investigated by the state corruption commission , is being instigated .
the former nsw minister is denying that the rules on maritime surveillance are not being applied at the request of his political mentor eddie obid , who has been hiding hidden holdings in three sites on state level .
the independent group of the european people &apos;s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats has voted against the report .
now , because of the accusation , tripodi has been taken from obeid &apos;s hidden interest in the properties .
for years , i have been talking about the situation in the united states , which began in 2005 , and i think that the government has been pressing for public tenders for lease contracts .
the popes were opposed to this and wanted longer maturities .
in 2009 , leasing contracts for companies on the circuit quay were awarded to the obeids annually for eur 2.5 million .
tripodi , who was born in february 2006 to november 2009 , had originally opted for public tenders .
but he stumbled upon the changes at the request of obeid , who , like tripodi , confirmed that he had been prepared to redesign the lease arrangements of the government .
one of the icac &apos;s telephone letters showed conversations from august and september 2007 between obeid , tripodi and steve dunn , a leading official who was sent to the ministry of ports .
“ was this the case in these telephone conversations about the development of commercial packaging technology ?
no , he replied , &quot; no . &quot;
i cannot remember the words that were discussed , but that was what it was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr obeid .
israeli fighter planes are attacking targets in syria .
israeli hunting planes would have been a target on thursday night in the syrian port of latakia , confirmed a leading government official against fox news .
the official explained that he was not going to do anything about it , but he said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , it was a “ new generation of russian sa-125-rockets . ”
at least twice , israel has already launched air strikes on missile supplies to syria this year .
foreign workers with 457-visa could “ be authenticated to verify authenticity ” , and the country ’ s government could be required to carry out a “ real test ” to ensure that the visa is valid .
the government is considering , within the framework of extended measures , a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .
if the test is introduced , it would come through a criterion for which the test should not be used .
today , a proposal for discussion by the government has been published after the former labour party members , maxine mckemw , have withdrawn the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers .
“ loud statements like being foreigners should be at the back of the country , ” and australians first set up are a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions are seeking a protected labour market , ” she said the president .
historically , the concept of “ soft power ” was to be protected – and , if some in the region were to see a echo of this historical artefact , they would not have me surprised .
the proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once adopted by the former minister for immigration , chris bowen .
immigration ministers brendan o &apos;connor , who was sentenced to talks yesterday on trafficking in human beings in sri lanka , has taken five of the recommended changes .
if the &quot; real crisis criterion &quot; is adopted , then the person who has a visa to apply for it could be interpreted as saying that the &quot; real person &apos;s application was valid in the cases where the visa was requested .
firms could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visas sent to the united states after the european union had previously refused to grant a small number of workers .
meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri lankan soldier died in the border area of the country .
the disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who was travelling with him to australia has been killed since his father died on wednesday , from a grown-up cousin .
australian authorities brought the man to the christmas island. the first time they had died , they were not allowed to leave the country .
the british government has launched a study which will show the benefits of hs2 rail for scotland .
in the work of hs2 ltd is proposed to start from the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 high-speed connections between scotland and the uk .
transport minister baroness kramer said that the project ‘ will bring britain closer together ’ .
the scottish transport minister , keith brown , stated that he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between london and the west midlands .
after completing phase 2 , there will be connections to manchester and leeds .
in june , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed rail network between london and norway .
the british government , which has been in talks with transport scotland , has been using hs2 ltd to seek further stress tests .
this includes the possibility of a travel period of at least three hours or less from glasgow and edinburgh to london .
baroness kramer said : ‘ our goal for hs2 is a truly national route network , which will bring great britain and its cities closer together . ’
we are going with hs2 because it is a huge benefit .
without it , we face a crisis of capacity in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including glasgow and edinburgh , which , thanks to hs2 , is improved .
the scottish secretary of state alistair carmichael commented : “ today ’ s announcement is a good news for scotland .
on behalf of the scottish government , keith brown carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” support for the scottish integration into the hs2 network .
brown said , “ the high-speed internet is a huge threat to the environment .
we are therefore pleased to be able to act as a partner of the british government and to discuss the options for a high-speed rail link in scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and make the glasgow-edinburgh link more effective .
i look forward to continuing the report with the british ministers .
rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain unchanged in australia for the time being .
australian passengers must also continue to be able to buy tablets and smartphones at the start and landing , despite efforts in the us to improve the regulations governing such equipment .
the us federal aviation authority ( fda ) is a global leader in aviation and aviation services .
during most of the flight , passport holders are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not able to leave their e-books at the start and the landing .
australian companies observe the decision to use the us government to implement them unduly .
the air traffic control agency casa also stated that it would be necessary to look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical air phases in australia were still not in force .
“ casa has currently no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices .
the issue is subject to provisions that state that airlines must maintain safety at all times and that passengers must be able to use the safety instructions given by cabin personnel .
virgin has already started with the casa discussions about a expansion of use of his wi-fi entertainment program .
“ we would be looking at the authorisation of electronic devices by casa , but we are not convinced that the directive will improve the customer experience , having been adopted ( dnv ) .
qantas explained that one would not be able to apply the current regulations for the time being .
“ our current directives provide that electronic devices must be checked at the start and landing stage , and we have at present no plans to use them . ” the european commission explained .
the faa rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that affect passengers .
the decision will have a negative impact on us societies depending on the age of the fleet .
they must prove that their aircraft are capable of preventing radio interference from mobile devices , and mobile handbooks , training materials , mobile phone baggage programs , and customer instruction must be changed .
“ after an airline has exceeded the tolerance of its fleet , it can offer passengers the use of portable , light-weight electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones in any height . ”
in rare cases , when the camera is not visible , the crew will instruct the passengers , while the equipment is turned off during the landing .
the group recommended that the main causes of the problem should be to control heavier devices safely under the seat or in the compartments over seated .
before the revierderby against schalke , coach travelers had traveled with light missiles for ugly scenes in the velocities of veltins .
borussia dortmund announced that the new version of the debian gnu / linux distribution will be released in the future .
before friday , the team of the bundesliga against the vfb stuttgart , the german football league reacted with a strong silence .
it was an unfamiliar , almost beloved , acoustic that was able to escape the viewer until just before the beginning of the bundesliga match between the german vice-champion borussia dortmund and the vdem .
the first was the first time that the guests were listening to their songs .
the southern grandstands , on the other hand , where the loyal members of the loyal and loudest bvb fans are , were initially exceptionally quiet : no healthy voice , no voice , no battlecalls .
the podium of capo , which otherwise would be the joint motivation , remained in the open .
and right at the front of the grandstand , the crowds of the european parliament , with the inscription &quot; section ban stadium &quot; , were blown out .
only as a goalkeeper roman weidenfeller as always the first bvb player entered the place , short time jealous burst up .
when his team colleagues followed , there was a loud chant and a raging scarf - but not everywhere .
the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the south grandstand represent the scene of nothing .
also that stadium spokesman norbert dickel once again had the positive experiences of recent days - derby victory , victory over arsenal , treaty extension of trainer jürgen klopp - sorted out not for the event .
only five minutes before the launch , the commission took a decision on the capo .
finally , like always , the south grandstand was on the line - and finally here again as usual was the laughest place in the stadium .
and at the latest as with anpfeff from the southern grandstand the loud call &quot; derbywinner is on &quot; came , was again everything like always .
the silence previously was probably a reaction to what happened in the past few days .
just before the revierderby at the fc schalke 04 , some of the travelers of bvb had launched light missiles into the public ranks and into the square .
the game was not played due to the chaotic scenes .
bvb-boss hans-joachim watzke had the tips of the dortmunder ultras in response to his office .
&quot; it will be used for the entire ultra-movement massive cuts &quot; , says the president of the bvb boss on thursday evening .
as an emergency measure , watzke banned the ultras from participating in a choreography for the home match against the vfb stuttgart .
&quot; i forbidden this , &quot; he explained .
zero tolerance is a fundamental principle of the pyrotechnics .
in addition , the ultras have been given various possibilities of punishment - until tuesday they have time to choose a more opaque one .
otherwise , i would say , the commission will be forced to withdraw its proposal by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be significant &quot; , he assured watzke .
we are curious to see how the reactions on the south gallery will be realised .
pfandhäuser is booming in singapore , as the middle class crisis has reached its peak .
in a pfandhaus in the bendemeer shopping centre in singapore janani amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreif , a ring and a few earrings .
“ my husband and i have just bought a house , there is my money there . ”
although they are paid 3,000 singapore dollars a month ( about 1,730 euros ) as a management employee , and their husband is also working , the monthly income of the family does not suffice , explains them .
indeed , demand in parts of southeast asia – where debt is more than twice as high – has grown so much that valuemax , where it has lost its exchange , has been the third pfandhaus this week .
the pledging of jewellery is not only a quick way to save money – 1.300 sinai jewellery dollars in the case of janani amirthamina is a good way to get it .
typically , pfandhaus in singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 % , which is just over the 15.4 % .
pfandhäuser however offers the advantage that no verification of creditworthiness or income documentation is required here , which is why loans are possible faster than in banks .
for this reason , millions of people in the region are turning to pfandhäuser after families have increased the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies , families with low income and poor families are seeking pfandhouses to help them get the best out of the economy .
this week , the credit rating agency standard &amp; poor ( sme ) described growing household debt as a problem , mainly due to rising mortgages .
malaysia , thailand , and singapore have , according to the agency , the highest budget debt in asia relative to gdp .
malaysia is the world &apos;s largest producer of agricultural products , with 80 % of gdp , and an increase of 60 % in 2008 .
economists worry about the impact of high consumer debt on the country ’ s economy , which has just come out of a technical recession this week .
on thursday , the data showed a continuing export threat .
“ in the end , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle-to-lower segment ( income gap ) will have to try to keep their income .
historic peaks at gold prices in recent two years have made the trend towards the food supply of personal goods more difficult .
in singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 pfandhäuser of the municipal state of gold .
people say : ‘ the gold price is good , but let us not be grandmothers ’ gold chain .
the largest thai pfandhaus operator , easymoney , has invested in its branches a 20-percent share of customers .
growth in the pfandbrief business is so strong that valuemax , the operator of the branches in bendemeer and 15 other in singapore , is not only integrated into neighbouring malaysia .
the company finances the company ’ s 60 percent of singapore ’ s 66 million dollar , which it had this week with the singapore stock exchange .
while some lenders are reluctant to go into the crossfire because of high interest rates , yeah explains that pfandhäuser houses are not only offering cheaper interest rates than others lenders , but also not directly increased debt .
“ customers pay objects that they have already , and that is the liquefied personal value that increases not the household debt but the financial crisis . ” she explains .
the pfandleihleistungen is increasingly seen as short-term , secure financing .
nor are all people who care about pfandleigh in financial difficulty .
rich people from singapore also come to the branches of valuemax to buy gold bars and red leather goods .
we are a company of customers from all social classes .
“ this includes wealthy people who are doing something for a business or an investment in the short term , or small businesses that are experiencing bottlenecks in cash flow . ”
sometimes you just need to go to the casino very quickly .
nsa absorbs data from google and yahoo - snowden wants to help help help you to find out more about the new features of the nsa - snowden wants to help you .
the secret service reveler edward snowden has , in principle , shown interest in helping germany to enlighten the increasingly explosive nsa-spähaffaires .
the green map shows that the federal parliament , hans-christian schöbele , was not about the unexpected meeting with snowden in russia .
snowden has been able to respond to his complicated legal situation , said ströbele to the ard magazine &quot; panorama &quot; .
rescue packages are needed for the next ten years .
australian government insists on the harsh conditions imposed by the rescue package .
federal health minister tanya plibersek announced that the commonwealth office will be “ prompt action ” to ensure that the crisis is averted by a ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of population , a higher level of chronic disease .
the funding for a period of four years was increased following consultations with the independent tasmanian mep andrew wilkie .
“ the government has created an emergency rescue package that will help to restore the country ’ s economy .
the 325-million dollar-package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for election services .
the new version of the new version of the new version of the original version of the original version of the original version is now available .
there are also money for daycare clinics in hobart and launceston , better aftercare after stalin and the rest of the family are specialised in the training of specialists , psychological health services and the introduction of a system for drawing up .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that have been put to me by clinic staff who have told me that they are the best way to improve the tasmanian health system , ” said tanya plibersek .
the minister insisted on strict reporting and monitoring of the situation .
the state must be able to maintain the current level of funding to finance money from the commonwealth .
a three-member government is going to be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
like wilkie today , the 325 million dollars would be of little use if “ they were not backed by real reform , but that would make the public tasmanian health system sustainable . ”
despite this , he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent help , which he initially addressed to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that the federal aid will make a major contribution to ensuring the public health system of the federal state is exempt from the worry list , ” said wilkie .
according to the government of the federal state , these electoral benefits will largely reflect the recent cuts .
but the health spokesman for the opposition at federal level , peter dutton , is of the opinion that today &apos;s announcement is just a “ paving solution ” .
“ we are therefore in a position to today because the laboratory state government has 430 million dollars to pay from the health system ” , said he said to abc tv .
it is not acceptable that a government of state should have spent nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and that the commonwealth should pay 300 million .
dutton called for the libersek to guarantee that not a single member of the rescue package would be able to provide additional bureaucracy .

syria has not yet fully exploited its ability to produce chemical weapons , a group of inspectors has suggested .
syria has important institutions for the production of chemical weapons and gitftgas ammunition , the global monitoring group declared for chemical weapons a day on thursday , while in the north there were serious collapses .
also on thursday , a symposium of syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began three years ago .
the announcement by the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) came one day before the date on the day before the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the day of the date on the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the release of the day of the day of the
november 1 , which the united nations general assembly , based in the hague , has set up to take over all the facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to “ inoperably ” to prevent them from being used , including all the machinery for mixing chemicals .
the conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is a major milestone in an ambitious plan for the future .
the destruction of facilities means that syria has no new chemical weapons .
damascus , however , must begin to use existing weapons and supplies to prevent the destruction of the country .
it is assumed that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals in the country , including the chemical and arsenic gas and the nerve gas sarin .
the announcement came at a time when the european parliament was struggling on thursday in safira , from which experts say that the situation is very different .
the group of activists who have a network of activists in syria who have reduced the number of deaths explained on thursday , 120.296 people were dead .
of these , 61,067 were civilians , including 6,365 children .
on the government side , 29.954 of them were the army of president bashar assad , 18.678 were government friendly fighters and 187 lebanese soldiers were killed .
also among the dead are 2.202 deserted armies , and the 5.375 battlemen of the opposition , many of them foreigners .
on 25 july , the un estimated the number of deaths this conflict had been estimated at 100,000 since march 2011 .
this figure has not been updated .
the conflict has claimed about two million people from the country .
assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in safira against the rebels , many of which have links with al-qaeda groups .
the centre said that it has not been able to prevent losses on both sides on thursday , but it has not given any details .
the fighting underlines the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors face .
according to the opcw , which is closely linked to the united nations , the “ now convinced that the world is all about syria ” team is there .
that is why we are not yet able to carry out any further inspection activities .
at the beginning of the week the inspectors said they had not completed the first round of inspections and that 21 out of 23 of the sites designated by damascus were visited .
because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .
on thursday , the opwc , the two sites were named after syrian statement , “ abandoned ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapon program were at other named facilities . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the site was in safira one of the two facilities that the opposition had to carry out .
syria has a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will be discussed next month by the executive committee of the opwc .

with regard to further developments , the head of the observatory , rami abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the syrian coastal province of latakia on wednesday .
the cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .
anger at judgment for bombings of bali
survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 at the bomb attack in bali were not able to respond to the anger that was expressed in the last of the instigators who were tried .
patek , who was born just under ten years as one of the most sought after people in south-east asia , was arrested yesterday for his role in building a spurious bomb .
with the suspension of the penalty , it could be dismissed after 15 years .
the 45-year-old was accused of mass murder and has been sentenced to death for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of kuta , where he was killed by 202 people , including 88 australians .
a claim for guilt was also made in a number of terrorist charges .
the prosecutor had a lifetime prison sentence .
the decision has had painful memories at june core .
with tears , the man in charge said that patek had been condemned to death .
i really think it should be included in the footsteps of the other guys .
&quot; he should be protected from a shooting command , &quot; he said .
i have to live with the fact that i do not have to get any more grandchildren and i never see my daughters any more .
the sari club was built on the ground when the first club was founded on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 23 : 00 , in a small blast , which was opened before the night club .
peter hughes was in paddy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a self-mortal attack was carried out .
he fell after the attack , a month after the attack , and “ died . ” three times , while he was dying of a life rearing system .
hughes said patek did the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell yemaah islamiah – amrozi , mukhughlas , and imam samudra – who were in for the victims .
really , this type should be above all else the death penalty .
to keep him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .
20 years to get after he had 202 people killed and many hundreds killed .
patek is the last of the bali bomber who was in court .
he was almost a decade away from forging , but was eventually released in january 2011 in the pakistani city of abbottabad , where us forces were deployed almost four months later to replace former al-qaeda chief osama osama .
during the negotiation , a fbi agent said that he would not be able to read the report that he had been in the process of being arrested in pakistan to be bin laden with the aim of establishing the link between south east asian terrorist groups .
“ he has not been asked , ” said corteen .
until recently , he has not received any repentance as to how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .
the judgment was passed before the ten-year anniversary of the attack in london this year , which was accompanied by commemorative ceremonies in bali and australia .
“ it will be a lot of tears this year , ” said corteen .
patek can protest against his judgment even more appeals .
faa : passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but no mobile phones are in use ) .
passengers can now benefit from the departure of their flight to the landing and read , work , play , listen to music and watch films .
but passengers should not expect to be able to make these changes immediately .
how quickly it would be implemented is dependent on the respective airline .
the airlines must be able to prove to the faa that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they are using the training manuals of the air crew and the rules for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the faa explained that it has already been asked by some airlines to make plans to allow the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .
among these airlines , delta and jetwroe were also .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could facilitate the increased use of electronic devices very soon , ” said the faa in a statement by the european parliament .
at present , passengers need to use smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft is not closed .
you may not restart them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres .
when entering the landing , the airlines must inform them of the flight and not leave them .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are subject to electronic interference could be able to offer passengers the possibility of using the equipment at launch , landing and on the wheeled .
most new transport aircraft and other aircraft are already in service for the use of wi-fi .
laura glading , president of the professional association of professional flight attendants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; when the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , &quot; commented glading .
we are frankly tired of being divided on this issue as if it were more attentive .
however , internet connections to surf , exchange data and to share text messages or downloading files were not allowed under three kilometres .
passengers are requested to use smartphones , tablets and other devices in the airline mode .
so still no “ words with fresh ideas ” .
and heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be dusty , as there is a risk of injury if they are driven by the cabin .
mobile calls during the flight remain unchanged .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls is the federal reserve ’ s responsibility .
faa may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing on the basis of the data provided for the flight .
last month mark rosenker said of the road safety authority national transportation safety authority that the european union should be responsible for national traffic safety experts .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they are potentially disruptive to navigation devices , but because we are dependent on the fcc to know that the transmission from the air is also transmitter masts ” , says .
a consultative committee of the industry , which is led by the faa to study this issue , will be recommending that the commission should present a report on the matter more widely .
in recent years , the pressure on the facts has increased , restrictions on the free use of faa have been lifted .
critics , such as the democratic senator claire mccaskill of missouri , believe that it is not possible to have a valid security basis for the ban .
the restrictions are also increasingly heavy , and the fact that the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .
some studies have shown that the problem of the death of up to one third of passengers is the problem of switching off the equipment .
the faa began in 1966 to promote the use of electronic equipment by air passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than previous ones .
airlines offer passengers a wide range of services for wi-fi , air conditioning and heating .
the software supplied to wi-fi systems is compatible with the standard windows .
the vast majority of passengers are from the eu member states and should be responsible for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said huerta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give much less radiance than the previous ones .
e-reader , for example , only give minimal radiation when you are able to scroll over .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transfer values are stronger .
among the defenders of easing the restrictions on the freedom of use of equipment by passengers is amazon.com.
in 2011 , company employees invited a passenger plane full of kindle e-reader and made a test flight to solve problems .
members of the faa advisory committee are expressing their concern about the situation in the middle east .
douglas kidd of the national association of passengers &apos; rights ( ncp ) said that he was of the opinion that the disruption of the equipment was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .
other committees have been saying that there are no more than a few reports from pivot , who are responsible for disrupting aircraft systems by the equipment .
the committee recommends that the faa should not allow pirates to fly , however , for instrumental landing under poor visibility .
a group of the travel industry welcomed the changes and the name of the group as a reasonable accommodation for travellers who are now travelling extensively with technology .
“ we are pleased that the faa recognises that a pleasant passenger ship experience is not incompatible with safety ” , said roger dow , ceo of the u.s.
by air treadmill from north sea port borelands gerretteter vogel freed again .
a light , airy , comfortable bed and a comfortable bathroom are at your disposal .
the water ralls were closed last month with a helicopter after aberdeen .
colin seddon , head of the centre , said : “ this water rall was probably a winter migratory bird from northern europe that was buried in the sea by the strong winds .
it seems that the erratic vogel was seeking refuge on the drill island .
he added : “ he could not do more flying , so we had to start asking for help .
when they were released , the water ralls were fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with britain ?
business for britain was founded in april with the intention of improving the economy to a table .
to this end , we have developed the largest and most comprehensive survey among british economic leaders .
yougov interviewed about 1.000 leaders in the industry and asked them about the number of british companies in the company , sectors and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found that the overwhelming majority of the companies now operate outside europe .
you want us to have a clear and transparent link between government and countries like china , india and brazil .
in their view on certain legally regulated regulations , the council of ministers , the commission and the council have been very successful in the field of the environment .
there was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , as the commission says that companies are paying the cost of the brussels rules .
finally , and this is probably the most important thing , our survey of economic leaders showed that the economic situation in the region is characterised by a clear majority .
this realization , which has been reflected in companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is heading for a “ meaningful change , ” which will be the remit of action to britain .
it is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would be at 16 % to change opinion in favour of the eu remaining in a referendum .
the prime minister should have no doubt that this survey shows that the british economy is behind its plan for renegotiation of british conditions for eu membership .
it also shows that companies are being hit by a renegotiation .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and in increasing need of it , after the eurozone has now moved towards a closer union with the economy and the fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as is the result of our survey , which is a major focus for companies on trade and a fundamental shift in the brussels budget .
alexei miller of gazprom is a pipeline in bulgaria that marks the beginning of a new gas era in the country .
the construction of the south-stream pipeline is scheduled to start in bulgaria .
“ today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the bulgarian section of the south stream gas pipeline has been completed , the biggest and most important project in europe , ” said the previous president of the board of directors of gas pipeline .

south stream is to be used to bring about greater diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .

miller said that the direct link to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the problems associated with transit countries will be resolved .
bulgarian consumers receive gas from south stream to distribute at reduced tariffs , if the entire project is completed in 2015 .
according to gazprom , construction works are to be carried out in other secondary countries on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipeline is designed to cover an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two ymca members of staff before accusations against jonathan lord for sexual abuse .
two ymca employees from new south wales ( nsw ) are due to be arrested for sexual offences related to children .
but at the opening declaration before the commission , the ymca stated that it had “ been able to do with a precursor of sexual abuse ” in the organisation .
managing director phillip hare was informed about a case in which a ymca team member was charged with offences involving child pornography .
hare said gail furness , one of the commission assisting lawyers , that he was informed of the first case .
he acknowledged that the opening ceremony was a very important step towards the commission .
evidence before the commission shows that the council of ministers has been informed that the situation in ymca is the second lowest of four possible cases in a quality audit of the department of justice .
hare , who was born at the ymca with 21 , admitted that the management had “ of me ” abwarts .
lord was a member of the united states army at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against 12 boys during his two-year term .
he was sentenced to at least six years in prison .
hare staged , however , that the ymca was a cultural problem that employees were prevented from using the lords. he was not able to investigate or prosecute lords for violations of children &apos;s safety .
the staff said they had committed violations , but they were not aware of lord alone .
danielle ockwell , whose chief executive lord of the rings was asked to attend a training session on child protection , because she was unable to attend because of his behaviour , said that the child services were not available in jacqui .
the managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to be able to meet their superiors .
instead , he said , he has shown their friendship with lord their judgment .
hare explained that he had given the board of the ymca nsw his view that the lexicon that the organization had learned from the “ jonathan lord-interim ” incident was too weak .
hare said that the decision to make employees sign contracts is a decision that was made shortly after the accusations were made , was taken by the child services director of the ymca , liam whitley .
he said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence .
the ymca nsw is a very popular and popular destination during the time jonathan lord was there between 2009 and 2011 .
he explained that the problem is “ serious ” .
the hearing was held until 20 december and was scheduled for the first time .
tony blair said that he would lose the chance of a return as british prime minister – but admits that a cocoach is unlikely .
in an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from the post , he announced that the 59-year-old had expressed his views on various domestic issues .
since his resignation in june 2007 , after a decade of leadership , blair has largely avoided the need to break up into british politics , and his comments mostly reflect the views of foreign policy and his role as envoy of the quartet .
in response to the question of whether he would like to be elected prime minister , the first question was raised by the eving standard in london , which said : ‘ yes , yes , yes , but it is unlikely that the situation will happen ’ .
when the horse show season was in schären , the first horse-shoe experts were in cardiff to shorten the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competition was in the offing .
but no one was prepared for the three years old fenton kirkland .
the trunk , which has not even been used in the kindergarten and has only taken its first steps a few months ago , and his shetland pony toffee trabbed the three rounds and holts .
the undissociated couple , both of them equally large , were sentenced to death for their appearance , behavior and style at the annual competition .
in his presence in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had his leghold cap in a free-angle .
fenton was played by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony .
and toffee received bestnotes for his appearance and personality .
fenton had toffe last march as a gift to his third birthday and since then every day with the shetland pony .
his mother , donna , 30 , said : “ fenton and toffee are a great tense . ”
they had to fight against the entire field of participation and are equipped with gold cup and rosette from the square .
it was only the second time that he was awarded toffee with a contest .
completely alien in the arena kept him as phenomenal as he was in the air with him .
the little boy from the village of nantyglo near the ebbw valley , who was born in the south wales , follows the footsteps of his aunt sharon howells , who have been horses for more than ten years .
howell ’ s story was that “ the whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired it and lamented it . ”
he ran on sand the whole length of the arena and although he was so tiny he was not able to see imagination .
fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , trucks and farms .
as he started , he will be not long in coming to the right place .
one spokesman for the annual horse show said : “ fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”
together they are a great team .
the jurors assessed fenton and toffee as having worked well with them .
they are looking for good cooperation between pony and leaders – and here fenton and toffee were the best in the ring .
i am sure that fenton &apos;s sweet clothes will play their part in helping to make the most of the occasion .

the guangzhou angel , based in guangzhou , had a rare public call for the journalist chen yongzhou to be released .
but chen later announced on television that he would use bribes to kill his brother .
now the new express of a “ comprehensive rectification ” is being subjected , the regulator declared .
the “ rectification order ” is a concept developed by the press and publishing authority , radio , film and television in guangdong , germany .
preliminary remittances showed that the market was not able to cope with the new express , which was added to the yangcheng evening news group , between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the editorial management of the new express was disorganised , ” the regulator gave a statement that .
she said that it was decided to create ‘ an administrative penalty for chen yongzhou ’ .
moreover , “ the yangcheng evening news group ” has been instructed to complete rectification of the new express and recommended to redirect the relevant persons in charge of the new express and to immediately release the management team of the new express . ”
chen had several articles for the new express written in which he wrote about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machinery called zoomllion .
after being arrested , he published a report on the situation in the country .
but then chen ’ s state television reappeared and admitted that he was making false reports against pay .
“ in this case i have zoomlion damaged as well as the entire message engine .

i realise that the only thing i have done is to act incorrectly .

drug tunnel with its own railway between the usa and mexico discovers the most dangerous and dangerous conjunctions of the world between the us and mexico .
one of the most sophisticated tunnels for the drug smuggling between the us and mexico , which is completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters measuring tunnel as a way of measuring the most sophisticated passages ever made .
the tunnel , which was built in the zickzack pattern for a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near the tijuana , mexico , and san diego , usa .
in the area there are countless unimaginable warehouses , which makes it easier to deal with drugs contaminated trucks .
the tunnel is closed , before drugs are undetected in it .
the discovery of the tunnel was a matter of eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine , according to the records of the court .
three men , who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers , were sentenced to death for the ownership and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .
they are threatened with a guilty sentence .
in nogales , arizona , smugglers are putting their faith in an extensive underground network of dewatering plants .
the tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been in san diego since 2006 .
some of the largest tunnels were built after the marihuana harvest in central mexico in october , which made drug cartels challenging the task of making their product safe .
in 2010 , authorities took a total of 640 metres long passage with rails , which were carried by a kitchen in a residential house in tijuana to two warehouses in san diego .

veganism is , according to lexika , the vegetarianism is subordinated , but differs from this in a very significant way .
for while vegetarians are aware of the consumption of cream cakes , eggs or a powerful eda-mer , they are not at the centre of the menu .
milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish , vegan leaves the vegan from all animal products - even honey .
what remains , you may wonder , but on closer inspection , the picture is different .
&quot; bread rolls are very popular , &quot; says the ute henkelmann , who is the owner of the local bread reform house , who has a wide range of special products for vegan .
reuben proctor also visits the store in the domgasse .
for 13 years , the native neuzealander vegan , living in lamperetheim ( almost ) , has found everything he could need to live &quot; in 1997 i put my diet and became vegetarians &quot; .
at the turn of the century , the next step was taken and i became vegan .
&quot; the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the shoe choice , &quot; proctor says the art leather normal leather .
he realized that there were also other everyday problems , such as animal diseases , which are not included in the scope of the directive .
first and foremost , vegan is an ethics .
&quot; i do not want animals to die for me , &quot; says proctor the maxim of vegans who are based on the entire consumer behavior .
instead of burgers , stirring eggs or rubber bears , we are now in the vegan state of being able to find all new products that increase enthusiasm .
&quot; it is a double bonus &quot; , says proctor today , &quot; actually , vegan does not renounce , no ascetic , but it is an enrichment &quot; .
and it is precisely these conditions that have allowed some to be more well-intentioned .
&quot; the addiction factor is a very important factor that many quickly give up , similar to the smoke &quot; , explains proftor .
and applies : &quot; certain tastes are not at the animal stamp &quot; .
often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; but you can also use other means the same effect , &quot; explains the difference between vegan and vegan .
a barbecue festival is held by proctor , for example , aubergins , mushrooms and a few vegan sausages .
he is looking at a balanced , varied diet , with a focus on the quality of life .
of course , there is a desire to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but the thing is not only on animal nutrition .
health damage up to eating disorders , further widespread malnutrition , has been unsuccessful .
for me , the changeover has had a positive aspect .
i do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased viagra content .
there are high-performance axes for the use of only vegetable proteins .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i let me often check . &quot; i am not sure if proctor is the right person .
in particular , the lack of vitamin b12 warns many vegansim critics .
&quot; because animals are fed with feed , we must not allow them to be fed on the pasture , &quot; he said .
vegan bred meat is also available in the coenzyme .
&quot; my b12 values are fine &quot; , explains the author .
wide paths must be made for proctor to provide food .
basic foods are not available everywhere , and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .
everything i need is a good idea , but i can &apos;t help it .
only occasionally i buy something special .
&quot; many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so is the situation with &quot; ordinary products &quot; .
in any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is far more favourable and less time-consuming , than is generally assumed .
&quot; in the kitchen there is much to discover with a few small cold dishes .
margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbonic instead of eggs , with its vegan cheese cake proctor could also astonish his parents .
family celebrations give vegan a new flavour .
this has dynamism if we cook together , it has a new significance .
&quot; the situations that arise are not the same as those that people themselves &quot; , says proctor .
of course , he was already sceptical .
taste the delicious food i have eaten .
&quot; should i now feel bad because i am milk ?
&quot; i reject the people not , but i am part of this society , &quot; proctor does not want to be a enclave within the deadlines .
and , more specifically , the everyday world does not appear as vegan as it is suspected - and vegan does not appear as much in everyday life as in general .
almost food is also allowed .
pommes is available everywhere !
&quot; many döner shops offer falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka &quot; , says proctor .
in a pizzeria , he is switching to pasta dishes , or just ordered a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habits .
the restaurants are so slow to adjust to it .
&quot; when i was arrested 13 years ago , i was vegan .
&quot; if there are enough enquiries , you may be inclined to ask the menu . &quot;
vegane restaurants are developing , such as the combines in mannheim or the café vogelfrei .
proctor has the desire to be able to offer at least a vegan dish on the menu .
basically , vegetarians are prepared for all .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes are exclusive , on the other hand , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others &quot; , states proctor .
&quot; if food scandals are to be avoided , vegan ism is a safe way to help the most part of the world from the outset .
purchasing veganer products can be used at the beginning , however .
especially when you learn to understand the fact that it is also used in peanuts as a color generator , you seem to be satisfied with following the ethics of so many hurdles and traps fast of courage .
not only for this reason , reuben proctor and lars thomsen wrote a book : &quot; veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients of this book .
&quot; gradually , we develop a scanner view and know where the signatures and logos are to be observed &quot; it is sometimes better to take small steps than to stand by or to stand by .
veganism , it is an important moral finger , it is a human right that is knocking on the consciousness .
perhaps he is not quite able to make his habits known , but at least he can convince the consumer that he is using his habits critically .
the stock exchange operator nasdaq omx holds its customers in aerial .
trade in the nasdaq options market is now closed on friday afternoon of german time .
in a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .
the other 11 us options markets , including the two most nazi party , omx , continued their business unimpeded .
the recent incident calls for a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns in the stock market operator .
only on tuesday the indian authorities were able to determine the indices of nasdaq for errors in data transport for an hour .
in august of this year , in a week alone , there were two breakdowns .
first , the us investment bank goldman sachs had suffered massive technical problems in purchasing orders that were defective on a massive scale .
the commission then needed to take a nearly one-year break , and the orders had to wait for the order to be scrapped .
two days later , half of the total share trading in the us came to an end because of a computer crash on the nasdaq stock exchange for several hours .
for the first time , the european stock exchange was closed for the first time last year .
nasdaq &apos;s systems were the most powerful of the console and the bulk of sales and purchase orders , but later the stock market orders were the subject of sec supervision and the company became a major source of income .

tax on foreign real estate owners against london ’ s speculative bubble
the treasury has provided temporary funding for cgt , and the federal government is waiting for the commission to conclude the decision .
already , the revenue from the stemming tax on housing is already exceeding the western minster and kensington &amp; chelsea districts , which are already in fiscal year 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds .
cook said : “ after the increases in the stamp tax on high-price initiatives , the us government has decided to increase its tax on high-price housing .
“ but this step could lead some foreign investors to be more cautious in buying real estate in london , or owners of property could stop selling . ” he added .
first class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – are in the wealthy london south west end glove , which is surrounded by full ham to wimbledon .
prices in central london were equal to the annual average growth of 5.3 % .
scientists could have given more light to the context in which the coagulation of a dog is related to its mood .
previous research has shown that the gambling of dogs with the tail is more like a dog .
but now scientists say that other dogs do not understand these subtle differences and are responding to them .
professor georgio vallora is a professor of the new york university neuroscientigara , said : “ human beings are well aware that the left and right are brains .
here we have tried to take this into account with other species .
he also noted that the hounds were just as much in the way they were in humans as the right brain half for the left-hand movement and vice versa , and that the two hemisphere roles played different roles in the feelings .
to learn more about how hats are placed on the side of the tail of their species , please visit the website of the animal welfare organization .
they measure heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .
we will probably soon understand why the vogue is in the one , sometimes in the other .
professor vallortigara said : “ we have the dogs movies with dogs , but we have either a natural or a very good quality .
if the animals saw how a otherwise outdated model of dog would have been able to turn the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the weaving dog ) , they would remain completely relaxed .
but was the cock tendency mainly after the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the wedge ) , so the tail of your heart and you sat on uncalledly .
in the opinion of professor vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .
it is more convinced that the dogs are born of experience and that they have been able to worry about what they are going to do and when they should not .
he said : ‘ if you have different meetings with other dogs and you have to wash your cock with one another in one direction , you have to be kind and the right side is a less friendly behaviour , then you are reacting on the basis . ’ .
researchers say that the number of findings is underestimated by dog owners , veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal .
john bradshaw , expert in dog breeding and gathering , is a member of the faculty of animal health at the university of bristol , explained that this is not the first study in which the study was studied whether or not .
last year , a team of the university of lincoln found that dogs had their head turned left , when they had an aggressive dog .
in another research on the university of vitictoria in canada , the following stated : “ dogs are more likely to be on a robot dog if his , tail , is wedelt and not on the right , rather than become restless .
according to his statement , the differences could therefore arise that dogs are not allowed to use animals in the film in the various studies or the robot dogs as dogs .
a study , such as dogs on real dogs , could help to explain why .
“ although there are considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two had been brainstorms for various purposes , they are still necessary to understand many of the details – and dogs are there no exception . ”
as their behaviour is simply recorded , however , i will probably not be able to wait for us to understand why the pregnancy sometimes turns into a one , sometimes into the other .

pope franziskus appoints the first kardinaele in february .
pope franziskus will be visiting new kardinaele of the catholic church for the first time on 22 february , as the vatican announced on thursday .
cardinals are the most senior clerics in the catalan society .
there are currently 201 cardinals .
however , a cardinal who has an age of 80 years can not be admitted to the pope &apos;s election – that is a matter for a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals ” .
in a statement that states that the commission has not yet published the information , father federico lombardi , a spokesman for the vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held .
“ pope franziskus has decided to reconsider his decision to convene the consistency story in february .
jack valero of catholic voices said that the number of electoral candidates is rising .
he explained that a pope was appointed to the greatest extent that cardinals were necessary to ensure that the number of voters was not increased .
the consistency story in the next year is important because it is important to have the first since the election of franciscus in march this year to have been so valero .
at present there is a certain overhang on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see if the new pope kardinaele from the rest of the world will appoint to restore the balance , ” said him .
forty per cent of catholics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .
the cardinals are also the first to be used since the formation of the church of st. francis , founded by the cardinal council .
in the past , the pope decided everything alone .
“ now francis has won these eight cardinals , which are now helping him , ” he said .
he explained that it is “ possible ” that franziskus would not have to replace the cardinals .
but so far we have not been able to do so – that is all very new .
valero said that typically , the most biblical bishops from large places to call cardinals , but put francis to &quot; full of surprises – we know not what to call him .
gm is launching new pickup trucks in the us to repair the seat backrest .
general motors calls just under 19,000 of his brand new chevrolet silverado and gmc sierra pickup trucks built in 2014 , to build a problem with the manual crawling seat .
some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the displacement of the front seat backrest .
for this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety in headrests .
&quot; when the back of the vehicle is raised , the first step is to make the head restraint more visible to passengers .
the returned files are not retrieved between august 1 and september 10 .
the delivery of the gm trucks began in june and represents the most important model launch of the leading us car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .
gm informed the owners of the vehicles in the first half of october about the defect .
the nhtsa could not be reached because of the 16-day government shutdown notification letter .
the sale of silverado and sierra trucks , which are used for the 2014 model year , is in the first ten months of the year by 20 percent .
in october , gm 42.660 silverado and 16.503 sierra nevada sold 42.660 trucks .
the gm share increased by € 2.2 billion to € 1.4 billion on the new york stock exchange , up from € 37.47 on friday afternoon .
desperation for a obama administration
i have twice asked president obama to do so in the hope that change is possible .
he says obama has praiseworthy efforts to improve the quality of the work done by the republicans ’ blockade tactics .
the policy of blockade does not apologize for obamacare &apos;s web site problems , the drone attacks and the intimidation of the drone attacks in the west .
obama ’ s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what happened .
nathaniel p. morris is a student in the second year at harvard medical university in new york .
i am currently reading a dreadfully sad book .
it is a book that i have believed to be worth reading .
it is called the audacity to win .
when i talk to my patients in the evening , and when i go to bed , i get the book back to a time when the politics was inspired by millions and listened to a speech .
the election was a landslide victory and news feat .
my classmates weren &apos;t happy and my parents collected them all time .
a young team of visionaries was on the way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when , in 2008 , obama took office , he agreed to the value of 82 % .
and then i close the book .
relocation to the present is a bad thing .
it is difficult to remember these optimistic times .
in the years since i first voted , i have been very concerned about the situation .
but it is simply nothing i would have imagined .
i recognise the great and versatile things that have been done by obama , from the adoption of the afforda agreement to the implementation of the health insurance package to the military withdrawal from the country , the end of the arrests .
i agree that the european union &apos;s party political blockade is too many to be desired .
but , having heard the obama administration many times in relation to colleagues and acquaintances , i am not satisfied with my attempts to explain .
i have one point of political despair .
the republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is not possible to prevent the interception of foreign leaders or to stop the killing of innocent children by means of drones overseas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency has not been able to collect data on the private lives of americans and why whistleblower is being punished , which has prevented government misconduct .
it cannot explain why anwar al-awra ’ s , a us citizen , is not allowed to be murdered without trial , nor why public financing and spending programs are being cut during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the white house to calm down the media are the ‘ aggressive ’ actions of the last few years since the nixon government .
and , more recently , it cannot be the inability to find a solution in the more than three years since the adoption of the affirdable care act .
i do not know whether that is what i would have expected .
whether i was with 18 , i would have understood that the government &apos;s work is in line with the previous political campaigns .
obviously , the mep is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and party are random events like the newtown-massacre .
but when i look at the examples above , i think they seem to be widely supported by the government itself .
and that does not bother me most .
i have again been elected obama in 2012 , not because i am concerned about his candidacy .
mitt romney was a confusing and unbalanced figure of alternative .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from pressure from future elections , would undermine the hope that the us will have been able to see for so long .
but with the fall in the approval values for obama on below 45 % of this week , the return to 2008 is marked by this book , all the more severe .
it is a source of anxiety for the many promises that have been made .
this week i read a section in the book describing how to make obama a severe loss against clinton in the talks ’ pre-election .
in a meeting with the election workers following the decision , he told his staff that they had to return to course and that they would follow the purpose of their cause .
“ i want us to be able to rediscover our magic , ” he said .
we must remember that who we are .
there are five years later , mr. president of the commission , and i could not agree more with you .
the information contained in this comment is not intended to be used for the purposes of the publication or publication of the publication , unless nathaniel morris has expressly stated otherwise .
clive palmer claims that prime minister tony abbott has won parental leave conflicts of interest .
the billionaire and mrs. clive palmer say that prime minister tony abbott would be in conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit .
the mining magnat , which is located in a judicial dispute over the payment of 6 million dollars to co2 tax , is the most alleged claim that the mining magnat had been trying to wipe out questions about whether it had been resolved .
the palmer united party could be the largest party to have up to four votes in the senate , which are important for deciding whether the co2 and mining taxes should be cut or cut .
but palmer claimed that only ministers of interest have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of abbott were personally benefiting from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave .
two months after the election , the palmer electoral commission declared with 53 votes ahead of the new election .
palmer called for a revision of the voting process to be carried out so that it could proceed more quickly .
tony abbott ’ s daughters frances and bridget .
if these elections are held two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system where we can enter ?
palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot papers .
use it because you then have to compare the results .
today , with pencils , it is incredible .
the election commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently adopted a common legislative proposal with new zealand .
palmer , 59 , explained that to his policy a global airport for the sunshine coasting , he was the only one to take over his new office .
in a public office , it is about the public service .
“ we do not seek reward except for those of history , which is that we live in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
rbs suspends two forex dealers and sells two foreign exchange traders .
the royal bank of scotland has two dealers from its foreign exchange department suspends , so two people who are dealing with the situation ; this is a further indicator that the uk government is not responsible for the global regulatory investigation .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including ubs , barclays , deutsche bank , and rbs , have confirmed that they have been working with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market , where 5.3 trillion dollars a day is spent .
the two dealers would be the first rbs staff to be employed in the expanding investigation .
the bank , which has not made any comment on the suspension , has confirmed that the bank has not yet signed any information requests from the authorities .
“ our investigations into this issue are continuing and we are cooperating fully with the fca and other regulatory authorities ” , said the bank recently .
last month , the situation of close people indicated that the rbs had not read the record of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier trader .
this dealer , richard usher , had the rbs 2010 and is now to be released from its current position as european leader of forex spot trading at jpmorgan .
rohan ramchandani , head of the european spot trading at citi , was arrested this week .
none of these traders has been accused of any misconduct .
the instant messaging group of usher included bankers in barclays and the citigroup , they said to the situation close to the people .
ubs announced this week that they have taken steps against some of their employees after the swiss regulatory authorities have found finma to have been forced to take a suspected manipulation of the forex market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six worldwide authorities – the european commission , finma , the swiss competition authority weko , the fca , the us ministry of justice , and hong kong monetary institute – have signed a contract with the swiss federal ministry of justice .
hsbc , citigroup , jpmorgan and credits suisse have also carried out internal investigations or have received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar people .
banks are instantaneous messages and emails from several years on the search for cases of misconduct .
the news of these investigations has hit the traders in one area of turmoil that has been growing in recent years to be one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks , but this year among others .
some bankers have tried to ignore the affair and said that they are almost impossible to avoid the exorbitant and highly volatile exchange of currency .
a leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity in the exchange markets has been largely unsustainable .
the news came on the same day as credits suites , which announced that they had not received a trader of their london exchange traded funds this week .
the bank informed promptly the competent authorities and works with them to develop a new approach .
“ we are sure that the dealer is acting alone and that the matter will be contained ” , he explained .
the fence on the bechtle plot is painted with a beautiful and beautiful wood .
a group of citizens &apos; initiative &quot; swiss meadow &quot; has opened the fence on the bechle plot at the kurfürstendamm in bad herrenalb .
in addition , the government purged and widened the footpath , according to a press release .
the planned cover of the decommissioning house in the back part of the property was not available for security reasons , because the site threatens to slide .
alfred abel , who has currently managed the property , had the beautification agenda of the village with his colleague reinhard domke of the bi .
before the action of the bi was a transparent with the message &quot; we are for it &quot; .
the situation was disturbing for the 20 or so members of the citizens &apos; initiative .
your motto on the big poster was &quot; the best we are against bauruins &quot; .
in doing so , she wanted to respond to the risk of even larger ruins on the swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .
in conversation with many passers-by before the &quot; construction site &quot; it became clear that some citizens believe that the project of the city is going to be better for many , although not a few people have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented .
but they start to resignate because the city has not yet received these answers , it says .
as you have heard , the effects of public statements by the mayor are also having an effect .
may had a very strong presence in the municipal assembly that it would be going to put an end to the thermal bath , if the population had to take a stand against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the swiss meadow .
some appear to be misgivings , because others are more inclined to think of them as &apos; crude attempts to blackmail &apos; the population , as stated in the bi press release .
the bi thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .
ranknick schelt for schiris : mane no swallow king king .
so satisfied ralf rangnick with the current high form of bundesliga table leader red bull salzburg .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and alan are going to fall into the category of swallow kings , &quot; he took the two offensivwirbler on thursday at a press conference in salzburg .
the most recent occasion for the ranking was that yellow was for mane at the 3 : 0 against grödig last sunday , at which the senegalese was given a supposed actress to be fatally fatal - which is not .
&quot; a stark misjudgement , &quot; rangnick said , the referee harksed as &quot; completely overstretched &quot; .
harkin would also have &quot; his part &quot; to escalate between salzburg coach roger schmidt and grödig trainer adi hütter after the match .
he was the first to be elected president of the united states , and he was the first to be elected president of the european parliament .
schmidt himself wants to be the first to be able to contact the customer after the schnitzel with his hut .
i do not know why .
&quot; for i am the one who hath insulted , &quot; he stressed the 46-year-old .
given the success of the project , the senior management of the company agreed to a praising of the company .
&quot; there is only two words for this : right well &quot; , he said .
there is not much to be said about .
the way in which the commission has conducted its work is particularly impressive .
this is to continue .
changes in the winter season in the transfer time will hardly be possible .

supreme course : the first is obama ’ s health law
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court , the supreme court , decided today that the country ’ s relationship with barack obama is not constitutional .
with five to four votes , the judges ruled that the single mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act was not enough to prevent us officials from taking action by 2014 .
the supreme judge john roberts proposed to the government &apos;s side of the four more liberal members of the chamber , while the judges scalia , thomas , alito and kennedy decided against .
the court confirmed that the retention of the remaining sections of the 2700 pages law was not applicable , and it also argued that the health law , according to which states should either meet the conditions for access to medicaid or should otherwise extend all state aid .
the legal proceedings against the law were suspended from 26 states and the national federation of indebted persons .
the law was adopted by all leading republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenge of coin romney , in the pre-election campaign of 2012 .

some talents moved to the garden and the garden was used for security purposes .
so far , sun-hungry people have had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin andersen presented the proposal to remove the rays with mirrors into the valley .
this basic idea gave rise to a long tradition in the village of heraklion since 1913 .
after several years of debate , the city council finally had the 5 million crowns ( approximately 615 000 euros ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been providing the italian alpenort viganella winter sports sun certificate for several years .

thomas bittner , group and city councils , chairman of the liberal group , supports his group colleague , mr bösch , &apos; which annoys me is the fact that there is a leftings changed or even changed here .
from closeness to the citizen , the post office is miles away .
&quot; at least the mail boxes in the city areas have to be neuschlossgarten and neuchâtel emptied again on sundays &quot; , says bittner and röhrenbeck unisono .
the nuclear city of heraklion was also well known , especially not mobile citizens , to have a box of letters containing sunday leakage .
tubular beck asked in the municipal parliament whether the municipal administration had had any discussions with the post office on this matter .
mayor erich maier answered that the post did not have lampertheim .
he has been told that there are no translations available.in hofheim also a sonntagsleerung .

google , samsung , huawei due to nortel patents announced that the company will be selling its products for the next six months .
the group that has been working on thousands of previous nortel patents was the one that imposed an avalanche of complaints on thursday about a patent infringement on mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was responsible for insolvency insolvency .
rockstar , the consortium that will be hosting the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , is selling the product samsung at the end of the year .
rockstar is located in the shared ownership of apple , microsoft , blackberry , ericsson and sony .
google is used in seven cases of patent infringement .
patents amount to technology , which is the search terms on the internet with relevant advertising in accordance with the law , so the complaint that is at the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives of samsung , huawei , htc and rockstar were not directly accessible .
samsung , huawei and htc are making mobile phones that are compatible with google &apos;s operating system .
in 2011 , google announced a initial bid to open 900 million dollars for the nortel platform .
google increased its offer several times and offered a new 4,4 billion u.s. dollars .
after the nordic walking season , the nortel patents have been overrun , the company acquired a new generation of motorola phones for $ 12.5 billion , a business that also contributed to the development of motorola &apos;s library .
“ although google is behaving in an attempt to make the patent a legal infringement , it is not the best way to protect the patents and is doing so . ”
rockstar demands a high compensation of google , as it claims that google is not able to take legal action against google &apos;s patent infringement .
egypt swore first freely elected president
mohammed morsi is putting the oath of office , but his day of triumph should not be the end of political disputes in egypt .
islamist mohammad mursi has promised a “ new egypt . ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to be sworn out , and thus the successor of husni mubarak , who had 16 months .
in his inauguration before the supreme constitutional court , morsi was also elected for the first freely elected president of the arab world and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .
he put the oath before the 18 in black robes , and put it to the judges of the court , which is based on the nile and is dedicated to an ancient egyptian temple .
“ we are striving for a better future , a new egypt , and a second republic , ” said morsi at the festive ceremony that took place live on state television .
“ today , the egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old morsi , a us trained and experienced engineer and member of the muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building when mursi was briefly taken to the city centre after 11 o &apos;clock local time .
just a few hundred followers had been tried in the court to help the new president .
as an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of brotherhood , the man in charge of his personal prestige has been a major player since his victory and a friday speech , in which he has not only been a candidate for islamists , but also of all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” he declared in a blue sky .
later morsi went to the university of cairo where he started his inaugural speech .
he was officially arrested by a army chapel , which was the national anthem , who had been killed in the town .
the military leader , feldmarschall hussein tantawi , was present .
upon his arrival , he was attacked by hundreds of people in the university ’ s largest auditorium with choruses of “ the army and the people are one hand . ”
the company was founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education and is now a university of cairo .
morsi presented a symbolic oath on friday at the tahir-square , the birthplace of the uprising that took place last year at the end of authoritarian mubarak ’ s rule , and he praised .
but , with the displacement of the official oath to the court , and not , as usual , before parliament , it bows to the will of the military , indicating that the power struggle will continue .
morsi ’ s speech at tahir-platz was full of dramatic populist gestures .
falkenberger disco provides a wide range of services for two great evenings .
the new season in the falkenberger disco theatre &quot; blue velvet &quot; has begun .

rape in south africa : twice life imprisonment
nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl , the police and the military have been the victim on friday to twice life &apos;s death .
this was reported by the sender sabc .
the victim was later involved in the consequences of the serious injuries .
johannes kana was in the police station at the beginning of the week .
the act had discouraged nationwide shock .
the then 21-year-old had a daughter anene booysen in february in an industrial site in bredasdorp near cape town .
14 hours fought the doctors for the survival of the victim , but he was in vain .
the sight of young people was so horrifying that the carers and snails had to be psychological assistance .
kana had been promised during the process of being able to work with booyses in a bar .
he also acknowledged that she was beaten and raped .
the police were initially informed by several perpetrators , but they were released from two suspects .
the prosecutor &apos;s office also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that cana was not able to take legal action at the time of the attack .
rape is a crime in south africa almost as much as a day of life : every year , there are around 64 000 indications of sexual violence .
these are almost ten times the amount in germany , but they are the highest in the world with 82 million people than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s organisations in south africa appreciate the number of cases of sexual violence but the 10 to 2 % of the population .

they thought that travel agencies are a part of the past thanks to internet ?
flight centre seems to be moving towards a more open and more transparent way of dealing with the problem .
the company has increased its profits for the whole year and expects record earnings of holiday makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company is now moving from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars , compared with the 305 to 315 million dollars in its previous forecast .
if the current target values are achieved , then this means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record level of 3 % of gdp .
as managing director graham turner announced , the company ’ s flight centre achieved a total of eight percent profit in the first half of the year , and it achieved a strong start in the second half , especially in australian and british private business .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in a good position to move towards record annual income before interest and taxes , ” he explained .
these include australia and the united kingdom , which are typically among our strongest beneficiaries .
in australia , recreation has become a major industry in the second half of the year , which has created a slightly weaker market for business trips .
the same was true of the leisure business of flight centre in the uk , while here too the business customers spent less .
the us business recovered from the seasonal weakness of the first half of the year , so that the third consecutive year saw a profit expected for the whole year .
the shares of flight centre increased by € 3 billion yesterday to € 38.20 .
schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics , legal education , and grammar .
in courses on english literature , you must learn at least one piece of shakespeare , one robot of the 19th century , a romantic lyrics and contemporary art in the uk .
the test also includes “ unseen texts ” , which are used to provide a broader reading .
the combined course of english literature is a great way to get rid of the problem .
from 2015 , students must have a separate gcse test for language , and there must be strong incentives for english-language literature to be recognised as a separate qualification .
the ministry of education will be presenting the new curricula for english and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that need radical redesign .
other core subjects will be discussed next year .
in a separate initiative , ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will be reorganising the gcse structures , including a new benchmarking system .
in a speech in the summer , minister for education michael gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence . ” while he emphasized that the g-cses would “ stand out . ”
studies show that in english schools less time is needed for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours a week .
on the other hand , australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in singapore receive 138 hours .
it is true that there will be no formal requirement to include more time in the timetable for mathematics , but from coalition forces , it is said that the full mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weight – will be a success .
the curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , which includes financial maths , and the like .

if the people of the past centuries had been too much aware of this , and had been able to look at those images of heaven and hell , &quot; which still shape our ideas to this day , &quot; the contemporary prophecy doctrine of complete is drawing from us .
&quot; the greater hope is for christians through the religions .
she has &quot; met us with so many question marks that we are not satisfied with the exclamations .
johanna rahner goes on to say , &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the anger of death &quot; .
this is linked to the question of the longing for &quot; the dream of the end of everything to be good &quot; .
johanna rahner , born in 1962 in baden-baden , studied chemistry at the university of baden-baden from 1982 to 1989 .

this tells ulrich knobel of the organizing sports club illmensee .
among the participants were , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude , numerous jedermannsradler who had their hobby in competition once .

these two could not , as expected , leave the field .
as in the previous year , felix bader was able to make a small advance in time and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance .
in second place , pazal treubel was again able to win the title .
the staff were very friendly and helpful .
in second and third place anne amadeus and her family came from illmensee and leonie drivers from owingen .
a pleasant development is the increasing number of people travelling by car , which is a major problem in the community .
not only in terms of performance , the whole range of services was very much represented .
age structure also suffices from ten years of the most recent up to 70 years of age among the oldest starters .
in the main race this year more absolute top stars were on the race track .
four drivers could not be convinced of the regional leaders .

on the way through mud , rivers and jungles for free medical care .
dr. georges bwelle provides free medical assistance in remote villages in cameroon , where the children are still being treated .
bshafen and his team spend almost every weekend trying to get hundreds of patients treated .
in the west african country there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .
do you agree with your mobile or other voice devices ?
dr. georges bwelle is one of the top 10 of the “ cnn heroes of 2013 ” .
you can choose to pay for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to make him the “ cnn hero of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 250.000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , georges bwelle saw with him how his sick father constantly confused the consciousness and led to hospitals that were not informed about the means to make him .
jamef bshaft was born in 1981 in the vicinity of yaoundé , the capital of cameroon .
he was born in the city of kentucky , and was a member of the royal family .
“ there was no neurosurgery in cameroon , ” georges brwelle said .
we should have made him out of cameroon if we had had the money .
instead , barbarian people spent years trying to persuade his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to take care of his treatment .
“ it is not easy , ” comments bshaft .
you can leave at 5 in the morning and go to the hospital , to help the first one , and is still not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people even die because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since bse was born in 2002 .
in cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the world health organisation .
on the other hand , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 413 people .
but even if there is a doctor for them , the costs of most camera manufacturers could not afford to visit .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem you have is that you are in poverty , ” says bwelle .
and poverty makes it impossible to save life .
his father and so many of his compatriots had to see in bshafen the decision to do something about it .
dr. georges bwelle and his volunteer team have worked 700 free opera projects last year .
he was himself a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon in the central hospital in yaoundé .
he also founded a non-profit organization called ascovime , which is working on weekends in rural areas .
since 2008 , he and his group have spent almost 32,000 people .
almost every friday , he and until the last 30 people are forced to go to the bus and ride with the snowy medical equipment on the roof over unfastened terrain .
not always , everything is going smoothly .
for more than one time , they had to pass through rivers and sludge .
but if you arrive , you will be like heroes : a festive , singing and dance and the best accommodation , the best place to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bshaft – with its wide smile and its boundless energy – is popular with the frosty guests .
the next morning the team starts with the examination of hundreds of patients .
“ per ride we treat 500 people ” , says bshaft .
they come from a region of 60 kilometres around the village – and that is on foot .
each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are being held hostage to malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites , and sexually transmitted diseases .
others get crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is important for school .
in the evening , the team conducts simple operations with local anesthesia .
the operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the entrance , the surgery is placed on the patient and the rest area is left to take place for the next .
the lighting for the op and the desinfektion equipment is controlled by the generator of the group and thus work bshaft and its volunteers to the early morning hours of sunday .
it is a challenging pensum , but the people of the village help to make the team motivation .
&quot; they drummer all night , so we wake up and let our work continue , &quot; says bwelle .
on sunday the team will then go back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .
the group – a mixture of cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has been awarded 700 free operations last year and knows that they are very satisfied with their work .
a man said that the free operation of a brute crash that he had received was now available to him again .
“ this changes the future of my family , ” said the man .
in addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , bwelle also works at night in private clinics in yaoundé .
this second job financed the company ’ s 60 % of its non-profit activities , according to bshafen ; the rest of the family from private donations .
“ i really do not know when he sleeps , ” katie o &apos;malley says , who was born in the second year at the drexel university in philadelphia medicine and volunteered in bremen .

the role of santiago , the old man in hemingway &apos;s novele &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is horst janson on the corpse .
janson himself is an old hand in his meeting , the actor &apos;s art .
the old man santiago cannot be seen when fishing .
this is how the two are simply great .
it is almost thought that the folds in the neck of the old man , of whom the fisherman &apos;s boy , manolo , speaks , can be seen .
if santiago is tired of life , he is on the chair and he is not in the chair , then janson is really .
in addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that janson excellently masters .
hemingway told the story of a fighter who was a brave man , who was not abandoned and who was ultimately replaced by his knowledge and his will .
janson is widely known as the sole actor on the stage .
it manages to draw the public &apos;s attention to itself and to make it more visible .
his efforts to finally get fish to the surface of the water are a step in the right direction that the viewers forget , that the sea is only made of blue .
director jens hazelmann has left the old man in front of the fishing village .
in the course of the performance , he sets the active scene in the light : the cabin of santiago , the bar of the singer marie-luise gunst , the bar , which is playing with her songs and her splendid voice .
the four musicians play cuba &apos;s rhaeto-style rhythm and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : descent to the romans
the hotel is situated in a quiet area , just a few steps from the city centre .
if you visit cologne , you will not be missed .
around 157 metres the two turrets rise into the sky and make it the second highest point of the church in europe .
but few visitors who have seen the two filigree church towers are aware of the fact that the city is also known as the cathedral .
rainer schulze is an expert in cologne and is a member of the leading german society .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of cologne tourism directly at the duomo .
the tour starts at a very unspectacular stage : &quot; we start in the underground garage .
in the 1970s , the city värrers wanted car fitting town , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only standing what was not too big .
most users of the eye-catching park are now also interested in the remains of roman times and only make their cars available .
but who knows more about it , discovers the beauty of the park deck d2 , which is separated by metal lattice bars .
the museum is located in the old town of kazimierz , in the old town of kazimierz .
&quot; it is remains of the roman city wall that were built in the second half of the first century after christ .
before returning to the daylight , the shoe is made to the upper side of the park by schulze .
that is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly seen .
the closest station of the tour is the praetorium , where the participants climb down into the depth .
we are witnessing the incumbent of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the champion of the ccaa .
as far as ccaa is concerned , a visitor wants to know what ccaa means .
&quot; the abbreviation stands for &quot; colonia claudia ara agrippinensium &quot; , which is in german as much as &quot; city of roman law and city of agrippine .
and when the praetorium is the former stately holder palace , the building of power , the roman empire , the palace of the empire .
from the hall of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the roman sewage channel , which is located here at about 120 metres long .
&quot; you can enjoy a piece of the so-called cloaca maxima .
a surprise has schulze yet .
after taking part in the cash prize , he will lead the team to a small , 16 metres deep , covered with a walk-in box .
&quot; we are now in the mikwe , a ritual jewish bath , &quot; explains the author .
the jewish community built its bathroom deep in the ground , to be adapted to the groundwater , which is essential for ritual washing .
to date , the lower end of the mikwe , the origins of which date back to the eighth century , has seen various levels of water from the rhine .
the mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the town hall square , for which the construction works will start shortly .
until completion , however , some years will be left .
leg almost chopped : rerun of rocker process .
a bloody attack in the rockermilieu is going to be launched after more than four years .
a trial that tried to kill , endanger the body and damage to property for two 30-year-old has taken place before the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict safety precautions .
the defendants were silent on the start .
they should be used in the rocker scene and then become the bandidos .
the prosecutor raises the question of whether he should be able to take part in the trial in finowfurt in june 2009 , together with unknown accomplices , in a car .
all the victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .
the victims are to be forced to compete with hells angels , who are the only ones who have been killed .
one is to be a high-level member from berlin .
this was followed by a series of persecution , apparently involving several cars .
according to the indictment , the issue was of revierfikfighting and a demonstration of power .
the two defendants were in jail at the beginning of 2012 in a first trial .
a court of law said at the time that it was not proven that the european union &apos;s men were interested in the bloody feud .
the perpetrators had carried masks and were not recognized .
the federal court of justice has annulled the judgment after the revision of the prosecution and referred it to the retrial of the court of justice .
one of the defendants is currently in prison for another offence .
the first of these was the creation of the new castle , the new building of the castle .
as a witness , the then determined commissioner was loaded .
the centre was on hand-held talks between the accused and other people who had intercepted the police .
it is difficult for rockers to be able to get involved in a crime that they find difficult to enforce in court - and not statements .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had been unpacked .
prosecutor stefan golfier of the public prosecutor &apos;s office frankfurt ( oder ) said at demand that there were no cases of new traces since the last trial .
for the process , eleven further negotiating days are scheduled .
the disposable company does not think of the company as a whole .
the night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but at some point it goes home .
but in the trees of the people on the front-passenger and rear seats , the hunger is noticeable .
of course , one or two cocktails may be the best choice .
what is more obvious than being chilled for the next drive-in ?
i admit that i am happy to be with you when it comes to late night or late night .
a few pommes , a cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !
but the way home is not only a reflection of the obvious differences between myself and other hungry disco goers .
what is needed to make a mistake about having to deal with its facts with constant regularity ?
in particular , at the weekends , the sweeping paper bags are on street borders and on parkplaces .
&quot; why ? &quot; , i wonder .
are people too doof to the tacks with after home respected .
it is not just the case that the paper product is changing the landscape , but also the paper production .
bags are also already available in transport facilities such as control panels , which have caused accidents .
i am not sure what the said &quot; disposable society &quot; thinks about , but probably she does not even know what this word actually means .
if you have to spend time in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know how to get back to the car after a busy night : klamotte , flashes and other things .
a few tents would be more or less nicely cut out - in contrast to the street where no one is on the food leftovers of other rump .
i can see the day when the commission will be able to give the cities and communities the chance to make a start - and the fast-food directive will be a good idea for their bags .
obama ’ s backlash in health policy
after much criticism , president obama made a backlash yesterday in his frequently repeated , unambiguous promise : “ if your hospitals are happy to provide you with health insurance , then you can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insurers have announced a letter of notice , they have raised their concerns about the future of the country to the president .
yesterday , the obama relatised his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who are seeking a functioning health insurance are not able to keep it , ” he said at a speech in boston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the redundancies , obama urged those americans who received such communications to sign up to the free market .
most citizens could thus have a better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast .
“ you will get a better deal , ” he said .
the government described it as unsurprising that the us and the world ’ s five per cent who had insurance themselves are still in the process of reviewing another tariff , as their contract did not meet the new standards under the affirdable care .
“ i would like to thank these americans very directly : they deserve better , ” sebelitz said at a hearing before the energy and climate trade committee of the house of representatives in washington .
sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the affirdable care act , is a member of the european commission , explained that the launch of the online platform was “ miserable ” since october .
“ i am as frustrated and angry as others , ” she said .
i am determined to regain your trust .
this statement is not true of an outcast sebelius , a phrase that is behind her sitting adviser at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives .
after more than three hours of consultation , long sebelitz repeatedly besieged the issue of why the “ architect ” of the affirdable care act was not released voluntarily .
government in jerusalem confirms attack on syrian air base not only in the area of the syrian air base but also in the area of the syrian air base .
an american government official who was anonymous , and who wanted to remain anonymous , said to the american intelligence service , cnn , that israeli combat officers had been arrested .
the aim is to &apos; missiles and related equipment &apos; , which are the israeli army &apos;s fear .
syrian and lebanese media , as well as the arab al-arabiya channel previously reported that the base in the port city of latakia was in the night of wednesday .
the israeli television channel , channel 2 , showed satellite images of the base in latakia , on which russian missiles were deployed from the s-125 newa and a batterie of sat-3 missiles .
uncertain about the government in jerusalem has officially failed to confirm the attack .
however , the news agency quotes reuters a similarly anonymous israeli journalist , who is saying that he believes that the israeli state &apos;s attack was carried out , but is not certain .
one speaker from the israeli ministry of defence said , in any case , &apos; we do not comment on these reports &apos; .
the journalist ron ben-yishai stressed that the european union &apos;s policy on the protection of human rights is not based on the principle of fair competition .
the israeli government has repeatedly warned that it will not allow syria to make any attempt to use hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons .
john kerry explains in an unprecedented interview that the us government has been unable to stop the espionage .
john kerry indicated with an unexpected indentation that he was not prepared to accept the defensive stance of the united states on its surveillance programs .
the foreign minister also acknowledged that he was deceiving barack obama and that he was responsible for not being “ autopilot ” .
the integrated and unbroken information makes the us government more involved in a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies .
in a video connection , the speech on the open government platform was presented to the public by kerry : “ there is no doubt that the president and myself , as well as others in the government , have learned of some things that are almost autopilot .
then he admitted as the first high-level member of the us government that the us government was not responsible for the border .
he said : ‘ in some cases , this is inappropriately gone too far . ’
the president is determined to make it clear and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one feels that he is being abused .
i assure you that the rights of innocent people are respected in this process .
kerry insisted , however , that the nsa was a force of good and that its surveillance would save many lives .
he added : “ we have not been dealing with a new world , in which people are willing to move themselves into the air .
there is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with the fact that people are killed , in the air and that is why governments are attacking .
so what if you are not able to find the right balance between the two ?
we have indeed seen aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people who have been killed because we have been talking about plans of this kind .
meanwhile , us legislators are being sent to europe to address concerns about the alleged american espionage .
senator chris murphy from connecticut said he had not been able to meet with representatives of the european parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to withdraw from the european parliament due to frustration with national security .
“ it is very important for the national security interests of the us that the europeans are aware of our common efforts to combat terrorism with the help of us , ” murphy said , who is known as a democrat in senate for the first time .
i also go to europe to make it clear that the european union is not a party to the fight against terrorism , regardless of its anger about the nsa programmes .
media reports that the nsa has been collecting millions of telephone data in europe have significantly improved relations with some us allies .
others unveiled quoted from snowden ’ s extended book “ the world ’ s largest snowden ” , which states that the nsa is the phone of chancellor angela merkel and up to 34 other leaders worldwide .
the head of the national secret services , james clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and explained that this was necessary on both sides .
in all the tumult , murphy said that his authority is preparing the congress &apos;s trip to see this year .
the names of the other members who took part are to be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route was going to be elaborated .
while murphy emphasized the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also talked about the need to have some “ serious words ” .
he said that european governments should be accountable to their people about the kind of espionage programmes they themselves have been pursuing for years .
“ although we can improve our monitoring programmes and thus increase the rights of europeans , we must also make them more aware of the fact that they are not the only ones who can avoid spying ” , says murphy .
meanwhile , the name john kerry stands for a weekend trip to the middle east and poland , to meet and meet the big resentment about the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

the police in phuket interrogated bamford for two days before they admitted to take a look at the story .
the court has not been in a position to judge the situation in the country .
bamford was born to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison sentence of more than 50 years old .
it is the daughter of peter tunks , a former player of the australian rubgy-league , who has been involved in the ministry of foreign affairs in canberra in asking for help for his daughter .
tunks explained to the sunday telegraph in sydney that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of the children of his daughter and wanted to bring them back to australia .
“ we are very concerned , of course , but we hope that it will be reopened as soon as possible , ” said tunks .
bamford has voted against the judgment and has been opposed to a security deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot .
in australian reports , it was reported that in the meantime , they were in the resort of krabi in southern thailand .
the court has been quite clear that bajor will be replaced by a local lawyer in phuket .
however , it is also possible that thailand will be reunited after the recent assassination of the kauffrau michelle smith in phuket to resume his wounded tourist image .
