gu@@ t@@ ach : even more safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not 100 meters away from each other : on tuesday in gu@@ t@@ ach the new b 33 pede@@ strian traffic lights were put into operation at the village parking lot - within sight of the older town hall temple .
two plants so close together : intention or a tor@@ to@@ is@@ es@@ hel@@ l ?
yesterday , mr may@@ or , expert opinion answered this question clearly .
&quot; the town hall temple was installed at that time because it sec@@ ures the school path , &quot; ec@@ ker@@ t explained yesterday .
the k@@ lu@@ ser@@ -@@ traffic light sa@@ ves cy@@ cli@@ sts , bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .
the plant officially opened yesterday was important for the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e crossing area .
we have the museum , two churches , a spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area › gru@@ b ‹ .
&quot; with the high traffic and pede@@ strian traffic , another traffic light had to be built to ensure their safety , &quot; ec@@ ker@@ t said .
this is confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld of the district council of off@@ enburg .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municip@@ ality of gu@@ t@@ ach on the b 33 daily , including about 10 percent heavy goods traffic , &quot; says ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore , building another set of traffic lights is more than necessary : &quot; safety is just about the way ahead &quot; , says ar@@ no@@ ld .
the first public transport was in the city of k@@ ab@@ u@@ l , which was built in 18@@ 8@@ 3 .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , the location of the traffic lights was tested before : &quot; by means of an extra for us with particularly long tr@@ un@@ ks of lo@@ ad@@ ers we have tested whether these vehicles could be driven out of z@@ el@@ m@@ ast .
the approximately eur 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the &quot; most modern thing currently on the market &quot; , explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
the facility is equipped with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which give a strong g@@ low that the lights are easily visible by the drivers , for example , even in the low sun@@ shine .
and it is also econom@@ ical : the older lighting systems use about 100 wat@@ ts , the new one just eight wat@@ ts .
there are three light installations per direction of travel .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technique of the new system : this is equipped with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pus@@ hes the traffic light button , the upper rad@@ ar sensor tests the traffic situation .
if the road is free , the pede@@ strian will be immediately green , if not , it will take about 15 seconds .
another rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the pede@@ strian &apos;s green phase can be completed .
&quot; if a group or disabled people go out of the street , the green phase is extended , so everyone is safe via the road , &quot; said ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , the mo@@ tori@@ sts must take part in the task of thinking as partners and watching the track .
this was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic light showed up for pede@@ stri@@ ans green , noise a super@@ class vehicle - with bright red .
jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing for more than 30 years the p@@ light of his child@@ hood and youth from the soul .
the catastro@@ ph@@ es of his catho@@ lic village child@@ hood - the lack of speech , the tend@@ ency to r@@ ough violence and bl@@ un@@ t sex@@ u@@ ality , the close and jo@@ y@@ ous - have been described by car@@ in@@ th@@ ian po@@ et in many .

the theater maker combines elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ ically shaped novel &quot; the ser@@ f &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) with pro@@ sam@@ ini@@ atures from &quot; cor@@ p@@ us nam , his family be@@ lau@@ ern@@ d &quot; ( 2003 ) .
the most important requirement is a cr@@ um@@ pled sof@@ a , on which h@@ ints are cou@@ pled and ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ated , and the eigh@@ t-@@ member se@@ al is attached .
director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little confidence in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance out@@ lines the template with a wealth of regime in@@ tru@@ sions , known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post-@@ dramatic game forms .
the actors in particular are often involved in some question@@ able scen@@ ic trans@@ positions .
they are se@@ ized hard , di@@ pped under water with their head , t@@ amed to the wall with their evening ro@@ bes .
embedded in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ an or mi@@ e@@ der , st@@ ack on dangerous high st@@ acks by st@@ aging , either mono@@ logi@@ ze lou@@ dly or lie st@@ um@@ b@@ led on the stage floor .
the text is hardly im@@ par@@ ted in this har@@ d-@@ pressed way , however .
the best moments of the evening when songs are sung - the band@@ width ran@@ ges from deep pur@@ ple to fol@@ k song .
only towards the end is the over@@ la@@ pping performance a bit quiet , and win@@ k@@ ler ’ s absur@@ d hum@@ or is g@@ lar@@ ing .
a black@@ box in the car ?
us road pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking for a source of money to repair the dec@@ ay@@ ing high@@ way system , and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can find every car in the d@@ ash@@ board .
the devices that record every kil@@ ome@@ tre of ha@@ z@@ ard and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by washington and state planning offices to over@@ ride the out@@ dated system of financing us american roads .
the usually rather bor@@ ing area of road planning has suddenly spar@@ ked an intense debate with colour@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in argu@@ ing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres of traffic , and possibly also where they have been driven , and then use the tax information to calcul@@ ate them mode@@ stly .
the tea party is hor@@ ri@@ fied .
the american civil rights association ( ac@@ l@@ u ) is also deeply concerned and expres@@ ses a number of data protection concerns .
but , while congress cannot agree on a course of action , several states are no longer waiting .
they are currently exam@@ ining how to change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per m@@ ile of risk .
thousands of drivers have already tested the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s , some of which are equipped with g@@ ps monitoring .
this is really a must for our country .
“ it is not that we may only use , ” said has@@ an i@@ kh@@ rat@@ a , managing director of southern california ass@@ n@@ . of governments , who record all the dangerous miles .
the way we pay these taxes will change .
the technology is there for that .
the initiative comes at a time when the h@@ w@@ y trust fund , which is financed from taxes , is bank@@ ru@@ pt for americans at the po@@ le .
but america is no longer tan@@ king as much as it used to be .
cars con@@ sume less petro@@ l .
the government min@@ eral oil tax of 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on ( less than 4 c@@ ents per lit@@ re ) has not increased for 20 years .
politicians do not d@@ are to raise the tax at high prices , even to raise a cent .
“ the gas@@ ol@@ ine tax is simply not sustainable , ” says le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , an expert in traffic legislation at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state recently equipped 500 cars with tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s to test a mil@@ e@@ -based pay system .
“ this is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .
bureaucr@@ ats call it mil@@ e@@ -based user charge .
it is not surprising that the idea has been ec@@ ho@@ ed by urban liber@@ als , for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that cong@@ es@@ tion and cli@@ ma@@ te-@@ dam@@ aging ex@@ ha@@ ust g@@ ases are reduced .
california ’ s pl@@ ann@@ ers rely on the system for form@@ ulating strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , law@@ -@@ ab@@ i@@ ding goals on climate change .
but republic@@ an bill shu@@ us@@ ter from pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , chairman of the house transportation committee , has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ ters of the reason foundation are also pleased with the idea of paying drivers after the distance travell@@ ed .
“ this is not a tax that dis@@ appears in a black hole , ” explains adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice-president of the directive at reason .
people pay directly for what they get .
the movement is also supported by two former us transport ministers who , in a 2011 report , called on congress to move toward me@@ il@@ -based settlement .
the us sen@@ ate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would have included 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the majority of the house of representatives prevented the move , respon@@ ding to the concerns of rural meps representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .
several states and large cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own .
o@@ reg@@ on , currently recru@@ iting 5@@ ,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experim@@ ent , is the most committed .
these drivers will soon pay the mil@@ e@@ age fee to the state instead of the petro@@ le@@ um tax .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot project .
new york city is also considering such a thing .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is tests it with tr@@ uc@@ ks to a limited extent .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , which includes the transport mini@@ stri@@ es of 17 states on the east coast ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is currently investig@@ ating how .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where 50 volunte@@ ers were recently equipped with equipment , mo@@ tori@@ sts were s@@ cep@@ tical about thinking that the government could pursue any of their movements .
“ concerns against big brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , head of strategy and result management at the ne@@ v@@ ada transport ministry .
people did not want it .
when the test started , the ac@@ l@@ u of ne@@ v@@ ada war@@ ned on its website , “ it would be relatively easy to turn the tac@@ ho@@ graph@@ s into full-@@ scale surveillance devices . ”
there is no need to build a giant , ob@@ sc@@ ure technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .
ne@@ v@@ ada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the kilometres that are driving , but not exactly when and where .
that , kh@@ an argu@@ ed , would also re@@ assure the public .
the hun@@ t for this technology has led some authorities to a small star@@ tup company called true mil@@ e@@ age in california .
the company was not originally set up to help states tax drivers .
rather , it was their aim to gain a fo@@ o@@ th@@ old in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they have travell@@ ed .
however , the devices it tests are also interesting for road pl@@ ann@@ ers , because they do not work with g@@ ps and only provide limited information that is regularly up@@ loaded via mode@@ m .
“ people are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , managing director of true mil@@ e@@ age , said .
some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .
there are much cheaper and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways of doing this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , the pl@@ ann@@ ers experim@@ ent with giving drivers a range of choices .
you can choose a device with or without g@@ ps .
or you choose no device at all and pay a lu@@ mp sum fee based on the miles earned on average by all residents of the state .
others hope to sell the concept of a susp@@ icious public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer .
in new york city , transport officials want to develop a tax@@ -@@ pay@@ able vehicle , pay a insurance cover only for the kilometres travell@@ ed , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time .
“ drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .
some transport pl@@ ann@@ ers , however , wonder whether all the talk about paying per m@@ ile is not just a huge di@@ version .
at the metro@@ politan transportation commission for the area of san francis@@ co bay , officials stated that congress could solve the problem of the bank@@ ru@@ pt highway trust fund simply by increasing the fuel tax .
an additional one-@@ off fee or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers with hy@@ bri@@ d vehicles or other vehicles that use less petro@@ l , so that they too pay a fair share .
“ there is no reason to sur@@ ren@@ der if an asp@@ ir@@ in is sufficient , ” explains r@@ and@@ y r@@ and@@ y r@@ ent@@ sch@@ ler , the commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs .
if we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things .

the volunte@@ er fire bri@@ g@@ ade managed its autumn main test despite a short@@ age of personnel .
only ele@@ ven men participated in the exercise .
in his practice as@@ sumption , department comm@@ ander h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer chose the property fea@@ der in bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stra@@ ß@@ e .
a short circuit should have been created during sa@@ wing .
the fire and the smo@@ ke that was going on in@@ ju@@ red two people , one of whom was still able to send an emergency call .
after the first examination of the facts by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer , two fire figh@@ ters prepared to enter the building .
after a short time , it was possible to find the first person and to lead him into the open .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so easy , as a narrow sta@@ ir@@ case could also be overcome .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ les for two horses , was not easy to secure .
it had a lot of wood and also stal@@ ks .
there were also electrical machines for wo@@ od@@ working .
the first ext@@ ingu@@ ishing attack was carried out via the tan@@ k in the vehicle .
the next line was via an over@@ floor hy@@ d@@ ran@@ t about 100 meters away .
now three le@@ ak@@ age attacks could be designed .
a hol@@ low be@@ am tube was also used in the building .
h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer also had a good time in the exercise to show what to do with staff that are not available .
in case of emergency , support is provided via the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d day@@ -@@ operation group .
the comm@@ ander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .
net@@ working of universities and companies
during his visit to the bre@@ is@@ ga@@ u high black forest district , the president of the country , gui@@ do wol@@ f , also in ti@@ tis@@ ee neu@@ stadt , was informed about where the workers of tomorrow come from .
in the black forest support centre , he worked with the managing school heads and the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the chair@@ men of the parent committee on this important issue .
&quot; education is an important location factor &quot; , stressed cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ h@@ le , director of the han@@ s-@@ th@@ om@@ a school school school , who presented the net@@ worked school project training center ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d .
wol@@ f was impres@@ sed by the model projects for training .
since 2011 , the city of forests has had a successful cooperation between the funding centre , the district gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um and the vocational training centre .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly surroundings in the county .
&quot; it is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to look after the care of rela@@ tives because of demographic change , &quot; wol@@ f explained .
he also mentioned that more and more people were looking after their rela@@ tives .
&quot; without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , &quot; wol@@ f said .
but no one can afford to lose qualified workers , he said .
another factor of particular importance is the net@@ working of universities and companies .
&quot; those who have already experienced the benefits of the region during their studies often retain the regional economy with their acquired knowledge and skills , which helps to strengthen the region &quot; , the president convinced himself .
only if adequate training places were offered can the need for skilled workers be met .
he believes that the advantage of the district is its favourable location in south-@@ west germany , in the immediate vicinity of france and switzerland .
he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg .
&apos;@@ keep on stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ly and ensure that public transport becomes better &apos; , he told the local politicians present .

the more than 100 years old natural stone wall , as the front deli@@ mit@@ ation of the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , which is before the restoration , is to be re-@@ installed on the city of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before the kil@@ big , the first works of the re@@ hab@@ ilitation of the former school yard built a small corner wall to stabil@@ ise and to reli@@ eve the sta@@ tic discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ade .
the next step , according to alexander mis@@ ok of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er stad@@ t@@ bau@@ am@@ t , is to include the land@@ es@@ mon@@ ument office in the planning and to create a re@@ hab@@ ilitation concept for the old wall .
the intention is then to calcul@@ ate costs by experts , who will then be put on the table for the council of municip@@ alities to decide and determine the way forward .
a decision on this is expected to be taken next year .
after the restoration , pl@@ ough@@ ing and plan@@ ting of the old sch@@ ul@@ in@@ n@@ enh@@ of within the two side w@@ ings of the school built in 19@@ 12 , the new wall must be put on a temporary basis , with the need for re@@ hab@@ ilitation .
the historic , one hundred year old deli@@ mit@@ ation wall of the old school yard to the kir@@ ch@@ stra@@ ß@@ e , is re@@ hab@@ ilit@@ ated mainly by water and fro@@ st damage , as there is no dra@@ in@@ age available , and has a cur@@ tain .
deep cr@@ acks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage , but the wall is not in danger of collapse at the moment .
a stable wall is a pre@@ requisite for a scho@@ ol@@ -@@ hof , which is what is happening with the current moun@@ ting work .
originally , the school hospital renov@@ ation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high un@@ planned expenditure caused a postpon@@ ement .
the land@@ es@@ mon@@ ument office will be a key word in the historic restoration of the school walls , which has even been used for film sho@@ ts .
if the guidelines are to come from this side , the city hopes to receive grants from the mon@@ ument preser@@ vers .
the pu@@ pil@@ s of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ er primary school , who are now taught in a well renovated old school building with a new a@@ ula , can soon use the old school cour@@ ty@@ ard .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants to receive jazz training in stutt@@ gart
ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , the federal leader of the greens , has now also interven@@ ed in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
&quot; i think it is wrong to give up the ho@@ lis@@ tic training at the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir the &quot; stutt@@ gart news &quot; .
jazz and classical music are currently being held at the jazz location stutt@@ gart .
this is contrary to the green red government of stutt@@ gart , which is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the federal elections on 22 september .
this will push for a re@@ organisation of the five music universities in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg on the basis of an expert study .
the programme will then be re@@ located from the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le stutt@@ gart to the musi@@ k@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ u@@ le man@@ n@@ heim , among others .
us border : &apos; super tunnel &apos; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling
on the border between mexico and the us , investig@@ ators have discovered and dec@@ om@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed a &apos; super tunnel &apos; to drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling .
as the us customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metr@@ e long tu@@ bes between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go were equipped with electricity , rail tracks and an aer@@ ation plant .
three susp@@ ects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were conf@@ is@@ c@@ ated .
according to the information provided , the tunnel had not yet been used .
&quot; this car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if you think you could di@@ g yourself under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the u.s. secretary general of the u.s. district , southern california , at la@@ ura du@@ ff@@ y , was discovered .
du@@ ff@@ y , who was directed at drug gan@@ gs , said : &quot; if you continue to build such tun@@ nels and try to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dir@@ ty money . &quot;
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in mexico in connection with dru@@ g-@@ related crime .
constructed by experts
due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , investig@@ ators assume that it was constructed by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction took about a year .
the track system was equipped to operate electric cars .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der takes 20 meters to the depth to the tunnel entrance itself .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section of 1.@@ 20 metres and a width of 90 cen@@ time@@ ters .
it would have been a good way of encouraging illegal immigration to the united states .
two of the susp@@ ects were arrested in connection with the co@@ ca@@ ine fund .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was arrested for the se@@ ized mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three are threatened with a maximum sentence of life imprison@@ ment , as officials have said .
eight such tun@@ nels have been discovered since 2006 , and the san di@@ e@@ go press conference continued to call them .
it is the first time co@@ ca@@ ine has been found in such a tunnel construction .
normally co@@ ca@@ ine is s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in smaller quantities , not by tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; des@@ pair &quot; of the drug gan@@ gs whose traditional routes have now been cut off , bill sh@@ er@@ man said of the de@@ a drug search in san di@@ e@@ go .
they would do everything they can to get to the us .
no details were given on the de@@ tain@@ e@@ es , at least one of them was mex@@ ic@@ ans , they were said .
they have to expect prison sent@@ ences of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 will be the fe@@ ast year
the anniversary of ge@@ is@@ ingen on the occasion of the 12@@ 50 .
the return of the first docum@@ entary mention is getting closer and closer .
when the year ends in just over eight weeks , the anniversary year will come .
ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en were first mentioned together in documents in 7@@ 94 .
a document was produced in churches , men@@ tioning both places .
the first church event was mentioned in 12@@ 50 years ago in the town of kir@@ chen , in which both were first mentioned in 12@@ 50 years ago , in the absence of any hall .
the ju@@ bil@@ ee will host a number of events in both ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will be 12@@ 50 in july on a weekend of festi@@ vals from 18 to 20 july .
re@@ union is celebr@@ ating .
on friday with a cere@@ mony , saturday and sunday with a fe@@ ast around the church hall .
this weekend the church house of the church is also open to the public .
ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th , director of the city of music , wrote a com@@ position for the city on the occasion of the ju@@ bil@@ ee , which is listed on three dates .
on june 21 together with the sunday celebr@@ ation of the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in , on july 12 in the arena with fire@@ works and on december 13 as the first concert of the city &apos;s music in the new f@@ es@@ th@@ al@@ le .
the official date for the anniversary is the last weekend of september 27 and 28 .
a new chron@@ ic@@ le is also being released on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ inger city anniversary .
&quot; it should be a chron@@ ic@@ le not only of ge@@ is@@ ingen itself , but also a printed work about the ge@@ is@@ sing@@ en of today , which is also made up of g@@ ün@@ sing@@ en , kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en , le@@ ic@@ her@@ n .
today ’ s ge@@ is@@ ingen also celebra@@ tes 20@@ 14 birth@@ day , and in 197@@ 4 the present space with the con@@ gre@@ g@@ ations was completed .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le will be presented on 21 or 22 november at the new fe@@ st@@ hal@@ le in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
20@@ 14 is also a year with many ju@@ bil@@ ee .
the nar@@ ren@@ z@@ un@@ ft stra@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki starts on february 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year existence , the harmon@@ ie gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen will be 90 years old and will celebrate the fe@@ st@@ ban@@ quet on may 29 .
the ol@@ d-@@ age le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen factory is 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ inger school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebra@@ tes it on may 10 , the poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ zi@@ g music association celebra@@ tes it 150 years .
the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen was first docum@@ ented in 7@@ 64 in a certificate of don@@ ation owned by the st. g@@ allen monaster@@ y .
the document was produced in churches ( haus@@ en ) , which was then a court court .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .
the reason 20@@ 14 to celebrate this 12@@ 50 year old accordingly , in addition the municip@@ al form is 40 years ago .
council is targe@@ ting rail systems
should the train crossing &quot; at the h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; be re@@ constructed in a co@@ stly way in order to increase road safety ?
yes , the local counc@@ ils have decided .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach must therefore provide eur 2@@ 20 000 .
the deutsche bahn wants to improve the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line in the coming year .
the main purpose of this is to increase safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings - there are frequent col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles throughout germany .
if the municip@@ alities agree to the restructuring measures , they must contribute a third to the costs , the rest share the railways and the con@@ federation .
sch@@ il@@ ta@@ h &apos;s town buil@@ der ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er explained to the town council the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ arities of the ba@@ h@@ rain transition &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; .
the city plans to build an extension to the tun@@ nel@@ mun@@ d there west of the railway track .
larger vehicles , such as those trans@@ porting long tim@@ ber , could also be in the opposite direction without having to block the tracks .
the gre@@ e@@ ks therefore proposed to construc@@ t a necessary for@@ ti@@ fication wall in such a way that the city could expand the road to the next one in due course , in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .
this was discussed in a controversial manner in the council , because some counc@@ ils ques@@ tioned the need for road traffic : thomas ki@@ p@@ p , in his statement , put the s@@ enti@@ ment of the cri@@ tics on the subject : &quot; must we take so much money on account of so few vehicles ?
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as contradic@@ ted : the train crossing &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; is regularly used for long-@@ distance trans@@ ports .
even wood from the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is partly trans@@ ported across this route , because the 20@@ -@@ metr@@ e long vehicles could not use the route along the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les@@ br@@ ü@@ c@@ ke bridge because they could not turn into the main road .
moreover , the route serves as a re@@ rou@@ ting for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed , ha@@ as argu@@ ed .
the route along the river h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en is also a long one , but it is not possible to see that the railway pass &quot; am &quot; in the sch@@ ir@@ sch@@ en valley is a major traffic route .
the counc@@ ils agreed to have the costs investig@@ ated by the thought to wi@@ den the road .
despite this , the majority of the members agreed to re@@ build the railway crossing , with the pro@@ vis@@ o that the necessary support wall would be built in such a way that the city could build the following road towards &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stras@@ se &quot; , if necessary , for 5.@@ 5 metres .
the transformation of the railway crossing at the ger@@ be@@ re@@ i tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in could , however , cause a completely different problem , which concerns access to the rapidly rising &quot; ger@@ ol@@ t@@ z@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administration had the railway re@@ development plans investig@@ ated by the engineering bureau bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er , since they had doubts about whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ haus we@@ g was then easily possible .
the investigation concluded that it was not possible to rule out the ti@@ l@@ ting conditions of the road leading to longer vehicles being mounted .
the city , in turn , bears responsibility for this as a road lo@@ ad@@ er .
the conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes .
ha@@ as argu@@ ed that , because both the tim@@ ber removal and the ben@@ ding worked in the current state of expansion , it would not be acceptable to re@@ build the railway transition .
the risk of a col@@ li@@ sion of the train with a vehicle on the transition is also much lower than the other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , because the stop at the center is next to it , which is a good view connection .
even trains from the main station would have to be bra@@ ked to the point where there was no col@@ li@@ sion .
the majority of the members refused to approve the restructuring of this railway transition , since the city of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach would have to &quot; take the burden &quot; of the installed vehicles , according to the counc@@ ils , since the railway may withdraw its responsibility after construction .
the board considers the re@@ construc@@ tions at the &quot; ver@@ tre@@ ten heu@@ bach &quot; and &quot; vor@@ -@@ ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; railway cros@@ s@@ ings , for which agreements have already been made with the railways , as no problem .
es@@ a deci@@ des on major space emissions : missions for bil@@ lions of dollars .
far off plan@@ ets , gra@@ vity waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that they are going to start in the coming years .
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .
far off worl@@ ds .
more than 1000 plan@@ ets in other stars have already found a@@ stronom@@ ers .
whether there are at least some of them living is not known .
the choice is difficult : should one search for gra@@ vity waves ?
or would you rather explore the co@@ smo@@ s origin ?
or explore the earth like plan@@ ets and discover ali@@ en life ?
these are questions that are being put by the people responsible for the european space agency ( es@@ a ) .
for your co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme , you are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to make the research a decisive step forward .
the budget for such &apos; l missions &apos; is approximately eur 1 billion each .
the launch is expected to be 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of september , the elite of european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
thir@@ ty ideas were on the table , five of which have now come to the narrow choice .
numerous bodies are exam@@ ining the proposals and are re@@ viewing the researchers .
the scientific programme committee will make a final decision in the next few days .
the es@@ a has selected four major questions to which the missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme initiated in 2007 will be answered .
what are the conditions for the emerg@@ ence of plan@@ ets and life ?
the exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the formation of plan@@ ets en@@ cir@@ cling these stars - are still in pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness .
a large infra@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dark .
and if a star has a planet , what circumstances can life arise there ?
in order to investigate this question , the space tel@@ es@@ cope &quot; che@@ ops &quot; will be launched in 20@@ 17 , which will examine 500 already known plan@@ etary systems in our immediate surroundings .
but the possibilities are limited , che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of eur 150 million .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map earth like plan@@ ets and even analy@@ ze the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , and thus search for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that are considered as an indication of biological activity .
how does the solar system work ?
this issue , too , should ultimately provide an insight into the conditions for the creation of life .
the magnetic field &apos;s magnetic activity and the interaction of its magnetic field and partic@@ le radiation with the plan@@ etary system play an important role .
in our solar system these processes can be analy@@ sed ex@@ em@@ pl@@ ary .
with the solar or@@ bi@@ ter , the es@@ a has already approved a m class mission ( there the budget is around eur 1 billion ) for this issue .
the pro@@ be is scheduled to start in 20@@ 17 and closely monitor the sun ’ s surface and activity .
j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and his mo@@ ons are also of great interest to researchers .
you want to find out what the giant planet &apos;s role has been in developing the solar system .
the es@@ a therefore provides for the first of the three l missions of the co@@ sm@@ ic vision programme .
the pro@@ be &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) will begin your journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later , j@@ up@@ i@@ ter was able to explore the planet &apos;s atmosphere and the ic@@ y mo@@ ons of europe , kal@@ lis@@ to and gan@@ y@@ med .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
space offers many possibilities for study material in extreme conditions and for exam@@ ining whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .
perhaps there are also de@@ vi@@ ations that could lead physi@@ ci@@ sts to a new theory , under which all known natural laws can be united .
how did the universe come into being and what is it made of ?
our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the big ban@@ g 13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago .
besides the material we know , from stars , plan@@ ets , and living beings like us , there are dark matter whose gra@@ vity gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ ies act together , and acceler@@ ate through dark clu@@ sters .
so far , researchers have not known which physical laws were valid in the first fr@@ ac@@ tional second of the big ban@@ g , nor what are dark matter and dark energy .
with eu@@ c@@ li@@ d , the es@@ a has already approved an m mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .
the pro@@ be is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the sky , thus allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .
who could make the race
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .
many experts say that the best chance of obtaining an l-@@ mission is &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a sophisticated concept for pro@@ ving gra@@ vity waves .
physi@@ ci@@ sts mean changes in the structure of space time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted nearly 100 years ago .
they have not been proven to date .
el@@ is@@ a could do that , the scientists hope to be behind the project .
the mission envis@@ ages a detec@@ tor consisting of two or three prob@@ es , which is sta@@ tioned in space .
unlike plants on earth , it could also prove gra@@ vity waves created during the big ban@@ g , thus providing new insi@@ ghts into the emerg@@ ence of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four more proposals still compete for the second l-@@ mission : a large x-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which is supposed to investigate among other things black ho@@ les , &quot; to feel the planet &apos;s ec@@ y plan@@ ets &quot; .
the project has already left behind proposals for the re@@ patri@@ ation of sam@@ ples from mar@@ s , for research into moon , ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ ids , and solar physi@@ cs .
snow@@ den is willing to “ cooperate ” with germany in terms of us surveillance .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower of the us secret service , has stated that he is prepared to travel to berlin and to announce that before the german bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g , if the american national security agency and its director , will .
the german member , mr han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , met snow@@ den on thursday in russia , where he received asylum to discuss with him the statement in germany .
in a letter from snow@@ den , presented to the media in berlin on friday of str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , he wri@@ tes : “ although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat a dis@@ sent with political defense as possible .
but telling the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , snow@@ den wri@@ tes that he believes that the support of the international community can convince the american government to drop the charge against him .
the prosecu@@ tion issued by the us ministry of justice includes sp@@ ying and the@@ ft of state property .
german interior minister han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich said online about time : “ if mr snow@@ den is prepared to talk to german representatives , we will find ways of making this possible . ”
us@@ -@@ germany relations are bur@@ den@@ ed by claims that the n@@ sa has inter@@ cep@@ ted chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s mobile phone .
thomas op@@ per@@ mann , the member of parliament , who chairs the secret service parliamentary committee , said that one should take the opportunity to listen to snow@@ den as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopar@@ dis@@ ing relations with the us and without him . ”
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , a member of the greens , published an image of himself and snow@@ den in his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was accompanied by two german journalists during his visit to russia .
str@@ ö@@ be@@ le explained that , according to the law@@ yer of the former n@@ sa employee , snow@@ den could not return to russia if he left the country .
if snow@@ den says in germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable member says .
snow@@ den explains in his letter that he would be faced with a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecu@@ tion that had driven him out of his home country .
it is , however , touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”
citizens around the world , as well as high-@@ level politicians – including in the united states – have called rev@@ el@@ ations about an un@@ controlled system of comprehensive surveillance a mer@@ it of the public .
in his letter , snow@@ den makes a offer of cooperation to the german authorities “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .
fronti@@ er airlines charges for hand bag@@ gage
fronti@@ er airlines plans to charge up to usd 100 from passengers who wish to store their hand bag@@ gage on their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand bag@@ gage and $ 2 for coffee or le@@ mon@@ ade , even if the announcement on wednesday was to keep all the do@@ se .
the new fee applies to hand bag@@ gage in the bag@@ gage com@@ part@@ ment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .
fronti@@ er explained that you charge $ 25 if you pay in advance and $ 100 for passengers who paid only on the boarding gate .
fron@@ t-@@ run@@ ner k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the fee of $ 100 is intended to encourage travel@@ ers to look after the payment in advance .
“ we do not want to calcul@@ ate this sum , ” she explained .
airlines started char@@ ging for the first and second piece of bag@@ gage they had booked in 2008 .
passengers who tried to circum@@ v@@ ent them have therefore packed as much as possible into their hand bag@@ gage , which means that the luggage com@@ part@@ ments above the seat are often over@@ crow@@ ded .
charges are one way of getting passengers to take less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said that the new fee is not really about making money .
it is about the most loy@@ al customers of fronti@@ er , who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a seat in the branch above the seat .
passengers who buy tickets on the airline &apos;s website do not have to pay .
this means that a passenger may be allowed to take one piece of bag@@ gage at the fronti@@ er gate free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of bag@@ gage .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley explained that the fronti@@ er website and the check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the boarding gate .
the new bag@@ gage fee from fronti@@ er will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no exact date .
passengers often go for bag@@ gage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to return to them .
they argue that the bag@@ gage should cost money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish .
many on wall street see the new bag@@ gage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .
most of them , however , have so far left the fing@@ ers of hand bag@@ gage charges .
spirit airlines inc@@ . demanded first hand bag@@ gage three years ago , and then alle@@ giant air , also a low-@@ cost carrier .
the only other airline with such a charge is hungarian wi@@ z@@ z air , explained the airline consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who is closely following the additional charges .
in a report in december 2011 , he estimated that the hand@@ -@@ bag@@ gage fee spirit would raise usd 50 million ann@@ ually .
so@@ ren@@ sen , who previously held a position of leader at mid@@ west airlines , has recently flo@@ wn with spirit and was cur@@ ious about what the company would expect from the carrier to charge passengers .
“ the boarding process was one of the most smooth i have experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .
i expected to see te@@ eth and hand@@ y discussions at the platform .
“ the plane was full , ” he said , “ and boarding ran as lu@@ mp@@ ed . ”
fronti@@ er also follows spirit in the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , le@@ mon@@ ade or ju@@ ice .
the company explained that passengers who bought lim@@ on@@ ade or ju@@ ice could keep the whole can and coffee would be bot@@ tled free of charge .
water remains free .
in 2008 , us air@@ ways had tried to charge for refres@@ h@@ ments for a short period of time , but it rever@@ sed seven months after passengers had compla@@ ined and no other large company had moved on .
fronti@@ ers ’ step to charge hand bag@@ gage charges if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at direc@@ ting customers to their own website .
airlines pay online travel agencies such as or@@ bit@@ z 10 to 25 us dollars per ticket sold .
this will give all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency .
however , fronti@@ er has gone fur@@ th@@ est in this area .
in september , the company started to award half the number of frequent fl@@ yer miles when booking through an online travel agency .
on wednesday , miles were reduced yet again to 25 % of the flight .
a flight with a fronti@@ er of more than 1000 miles booked by a third party therefore only brings customers 250 miles .
passengers can also only book directly on the website of fronti@@ er seats .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al customer base at its headquarters in den@@ ver , but the business is shr@@ in@@ king and the company is losing money .
the revenues dec@@ lined by 9 % , and flight capacity contrac@@ ted by almost 13 % in the first quarter , as is evident in the financial report published on wednesday by the parent company , inc .
republic has tried to get the finances of fronti@@ er under control as part of the company &apos;s sales .
pro@@ ver@@ bs come from the bi@@ ble
more than 40 women visited the last women &apos;s breakfast this year in the prote@@ stant par@@ ish of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the municip@@ al house were &quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; phr@@ ases from the middle ages &quot; .
after breakfast , z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chairman of the church council , addressed the bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs in a presentation .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain life wis@@ dom , rules , or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several pro@@ ver@@ bs to the corresponding bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al places and explained the meaning .
she called pro@@ ver@@ bs like : a bu@@ ll &apos;s sp@@ ell is vig@@ il@@ ant , like sc@@ ales fall from your eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his mind in sleep , washing his hands of his hands .
several times , the speaker also let her list@@ en@@ ers gu@@ ess what the saying was .
the medieval phr@@ ases were followed by the church counc@@ ill@@ or , chris@@ tel de@@ h@@ ner : all good things are three , make blue , bre@@ a@@ the some things .
she explained the meaning and origin of the phr@@ ases she called &quot; brid@@ ges to the past &quot; .
in the end , a ra@@ ff@@ le was ra@@ ff@@ led .
the pri@@ zes were covered on a table and were re@@ written hum@@ or@@ ously before being handed over to the winners .
the visitors to the breakfast round also included may@@ or roman wai@@ z@@ en@@ e@@ gger .
learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for un@@ skilled tourism
a pilot project for the tourism industry is taking place at the mec@@ k@@ len@@ burg lake district .
under the leadership of the german labour agency , 49 women and men who are already working as un@@ skilled in the industry are to be qualified for hotel and restaurant staff over three winter .
&quot; what is new is that the six@@ -@@ month courses end with degrees , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the labour agency neu@@ brand@@ enburg .
the benefits are mani@@ fold : they would not make the participants unemployed , companies would receive trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .
the project also includes the chamber of commerce and industry in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( de@@ ho@@ ga ) mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ vor@@ pom@@ mer@@ n .
n@@ sa explains that it is an “ internal error ” and that it is not h@@ ack@@ ers that are to blame for cr@@ ash@@ ing the website .
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency said on late friday that a mistake had par@@ aly@@ sed their public website for a few hours , not h@@ ack@@ ers , as online claims .
“ n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was not available for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a scheduled update , ” explained the sp@@ y agency in an email message .
the problem will be fixed this evening .
the claim that the failure was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service attack ( d@@ dos ) was not true .
in the early hours of the evening , online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noticed that the n@@ sa website was not available for at least six hours and that some users still cannot .
previously , a n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ man told ab@@ c news that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ not com@@ promised in any way . ”
secret information is not in danger , according to the speaker .
at least one group of h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts claimed to have par@@ aly@@ sed the n@@ sa website with a d@@ dos attack .
in the case of such attacks , the target site is floo@@ ded with page views until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
cy@@ ber@@ tac@@ tics are relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to inv@@ ade the target system &apos;s internal network .
the former super@@ secret n@@ sa , whose n@@ ick@@ name was once no such agency ( no such authority ) , has now been released in the bright light of the public , and looks like the pretty results published in recent months .
the growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the secret service fu@@ el@@ ed initial spec@@ ulation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cy@@ pri@@ ot operation .
the number of people without jobs dro@@ pped slightly in october by 22 to 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
although the 3.@@ 1 % quota is better than last year and also better than in september , &quot; we would have hoped for more , &quot; says mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , depu@@ ty chief executive officer of the agency .
many companies have re@@ acted to at@@ titu@@ des .
one reason for this is , according to fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , &quot; we have hardly any skilled workers in the craft industry , in health care and in care for the elderly &quot; .
since september , the number of employees in the hotel and restaurant industry has been increasing since the year .
the winter season starts in mid-@@ december .

bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s profit losses following a fall in supply and orders .
the can@@ a@@ dian aircraft and rail manufacturer bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit on thursday , following falling orders and deli@@ veries to aircraft under the third quarter .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , based in mon@@ tre@@ al , did not publish flight test data for his brand new c@@ series air@@ lin@@ er and did not give any new information as to whether the aircraft could go next september according to the ambitious commercial schedule .
the ma@@ ide@@ n flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has been followed by only three more take@@ -@@ off@@ s , which makes it doub@@ t@@ ful whether the test phase is running as planned .
the results fell short of the forec@@ asts and resulted in a fall in the price of more than 8 % on the tor@@ onto stock market .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , analy@@ st at national bank financial , reduced his assessment of “ out@@ perform ” on “ sector perform ” on thursday , with the stock in the next one to two quarters limited .
“ while weak@@ er delivery numbers were expected for aircraft to a large extent , we are clearly disappointed by the mar@@ gin development in the transport sector , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen in a customer letter .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will receive new orders for the c@@ series when the flight test program is progres@@ sing .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more ske@@ p@@ tical about the programme .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes that the c@@ series aircraft will be able to cat@@ ap@@ ult the company into the lower market segment , which is currently dominated by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test aircraft was presented to the public in march and fle@@ w for the first time in september after months of delays .
but , until now , binding orders for the c@@ series are moderate , with 17@@ 7 , as potential bu@@ yers want to wait for the results of flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings for the new jet .
currently there are 4@@ 03 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .
ceo pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in is confident that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .
the management also assured analy@@ sts and the media that the programme was on schedule on thursday .
“ the test aircraft has not remained on the ground any longer than expected , ” said beau@@ do@@ in at a telephone conference and added that soil tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft ’ s stand@@ time .
every manufacturer plans differently .
we have decided to take a first flight and then app@@ end a review period , which is what we have done .
this is done throughout the flight programme .
the second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly there@@ after , it was said by the company side .
nevertheless , analy@@ sts remain s@@ cep@@ tical as to whether 12 months after the ma@@ ide@@ n flight the first customer can start a c@@ series plane .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er explained that it is checking the planning for commission@@ ing ( ice ) and will update it in the coming months .
“ the slow progress of the flight test – though it is obviously bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s internal planning – rein@@ forces our view that commission@@ ing is moving to the first quarter of 20@@ 15 , ” said do@@ er@@ k@@ ke .
in the third quarter at the end of september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or $ 8 million per share , or $ 9 million per share in previous years .
the adjusted profit per share is un@@ changed at 9 c@@ ents .
sales decreas@@ ed slightly , from $ 4.@@ 2 billion to $ 4.@@ 1 billion .
analy@@ sts expected a profit of 10 c@@ ents per share and a tur@@ nover of 4.@@ 56 billion dollars , according to th@@ om@@ son re@@ u@@ ters i / b / e / s / s / s .
the world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer claims that it delivered 45 aircraft in the quarter , a drop of 57 last year .
net orders fell from 8@@ 3 aircraft to 26 .
the order book in the aero@@ space sector stood at $ 3@@ 2.@@ 9 billion on 30 september , un@@ changed on 31 december .
“ in the aero@@ space sector , the results were within our limits , but the low in@@ take of orders and overall market conditions were dis@@ appoin@@ ting , ” said beau@@ do@@ in .
revenues in the aero@@ space sector fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er , the world ’ s largest rail manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector have ris@@ en by almost 11 % to $ 2.@@ 1 billion .
the order book in the transport division amoun@@ ted to usd 3@@ 2.@@ 6 billion on 30 september , slightly higher than 31 december .
the profit mar@@ gin in the transport sector was affected by handling problems in some major contracts .
according to corporate governance , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .
in the after@@ no@@ ons of trading on thursday , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er ’ s share dro@@ pped by 8.@@ 5 % and fell to 4.@@ 8@@ 3 can@@ a@@ dian dollars , after it was also announced that the google finance board will replace pat@@ ric@@ k pic@@ he@@ tte .
the braz@@ ili@@ an em@@ bra@@ er sa , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bom@@ bar@@ di@@ ers of the clo@@ s@@ est ri@@ val , reported a 10 % decline in quar@@ ter@@ ly profits on thursday .
usa : bul@@ lets at los angel@@ es airport
an unknown person fi@@ red sho@@ ts at la@@ x airport on friday morning ( local time ) .
while the airport administration told t@@ wit@@ ter via the short news service that the sho@@ o@@ ter was in cust@@ o@@ dy , the los angel@@ es times reported that the man was dead .
a security man has also been killed .
the media also reported several in@@ ju@@ red .
us president bar@@ ack obama is constantly being informed of the situation , said the white house spo@@ kes@@ man , j@@ ay car@@ ney .
the incident occurred in terminal 3 e@@ ye@@ wit@@ nesses indicated that they had seen a sho@@ o@@ ter with a gun in one of the departure h@@ alls , as several media reported .
a travell@@ er told the station c@@ n@@ n that many people had been looking for protection in pan@@ ic .
travellers would have cr@@ ou@@ ched for sh@@ ell@@ s and children .
pan@@ ic er@@ up@@ ted among the waiting party , many would have hidden behind chairs for fear .
he heard two sho@@ ts , says a travel@@ er of the los angel@@ es times .
a t@@ sa security official has suffered a shot cr@@ ash .
the scene was &quot; like in a movie &quot; .
after that , he had been brought into a security area himself , the man reported .
the sho@@ ts should have fallen close to a security control area .
airport buildings ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated
television scre@@ ens showed a large number of am@@ bu@@ lan@@ ces and police cars in front of a terminal .
hundreds of people were taken out of the building into safety .
t@@ wit@@ ter users published photos of a special intervention command and a ri@@ f@@ le on the ground .
as the airport management told us via t@@ wit@@ ter , the incident started at 9.@@ 30 a.m. ( local time ) .
the access roads were closed , which caused long delays , according to c@@ n@@ n .
except for land@@ ings , air traffic had been tempor@@ arily dis@@ continued , it was said .
however , several plan@@ es were also visible on c@@ n@@ n at the start .
terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller us airlines .

co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dic@@ t , who war@@ ned the drug bo@@ ss of police investigation , must be imprison@@ ed .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , gave information on the sub@@ world size ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough further on .
the law@@ yer was afraid that his secret drug ad@@ diction might come to light .
he was sent@@ enced by li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court to three years in prison .
a well-known criminal prosecu@@ tor who war@@ ned a drug bar@@ on of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug ad@@ diction could be detec@@ ted was sent@@ enced to three years in prison .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , provided ne@@ il scar@@ bor@@ ough with sensitive information on investigations into his activities in the drug trade after being com@@ promised by his own co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction .
the criminal ’ s “ first class ” law@@ yer , n@@ ick@@ named “ bas@@ h , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police had supervis@@ ed scar@@ bor@@ ough , which he had previously conducted a drug trial .
officials wat@@ ched scar@@ bor@@ ough ( 32 ) deliver three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the law@@ yer ’ s house in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , while he was with colleagues at a dinner with colleagues .
the investigation revealed that d@@ it@@ ta regularly used class a drugs after tests found trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , his wal@@ let , and credit cards .
over a period of eight months between january and august 2011 , he attemp@@ ted to obtain un@@ law@@ ful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough and one of his partners .
all four susp@@ ects were then monitored by the police in the course of a major investigation into her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine trade in lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , and west .
together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.5 million and £ 200@@ ,000 in cash in a series of house sear@@ ches .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , passed on information to the crimin@@ als for fe@@ aring that his drug ad@@ diction could become public .
today , d@@ it@@ ta , working for the law firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors in black@@ bur@@ n , was convic@@ ted of dis@@ ability at li@@ ver@@ pool &apos;s cro@@ wn court after a three-@@ week trial on two points of justice .
he ad@@ mitted co@@ ca@@ ine ownership during an earlier survey .
the law@@ yer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against scar@@ bor@@ ough that he had been in regular telephone contact with d@@ it@@ ta in february 2011 .
two investig@@ ators followed the susp@@ ect and saw him go to d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house and put drugs under the du@@ st@@ b@@ in of the law@@ yer with a pure 60 % in a black golf g@@ love .
shortly after he delivered the drugs , scar@@ bor@@ ough regularly tele@@ ph@@ oned d@@ it@@ ta , who was in the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers football sta@@ dium in e@@ wood park at dinner .
the law@@ yer returned home , took the drugs and nine communications were ex@@ changed between the two .
in court , d@@ it@@ ta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of co@@ ca@@ ine after class a drugs were discovered in his hair , wal@@ let , and credit cards .
d@@ it@@ ta was arrested later , but stopped taking co@@ ca@@ ine and said that he had spoken to the alleg@@ ed deal@@ er because he was his client , and said that he had been a secret law@@ yer .
during his arrest , d@@ it@@ ta took his wal@@ let and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were se@@ ized and a hair@@ sample was taken from him .
in the case of police inter@@ ro@@ gation , he stated that he had an office both at his private address and at the work@@ place and that clients would call him at home for legal matters .
it was announced in court that he had called important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant ar@@ re@@ sts and informed the investig@@ ators of their knowledge .
prosecu@@ tor anne w@@ hy@@ te said : “ a criminal law@@ yer should know better than anyone that the law is not breaking . ”
d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal def@@ en@@ der , because he has become too involved with certain clients .
the relationship in question is not simply that of a drug deal@@ er , but of a drug deal@@ er who supplies his law@@ yer with drugs .
some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the law@@ yer for these people .
but that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between law@@ yer and client .
he was involved in police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has thus dis@@ credited his profes@@ sion .
he was too close to certain clients , in particular scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta pointed out every mis@@ conduct and said , “ if i were a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , which i am not , and wanted to pass on information to scar@@ bor@@ ough , i would wait immediately , not 15 hours . ”
but , after the hearing , super@@ int@@ ent le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad said from the lan@@ cas@@ hire police : “ mr d@@ it@@ ta has taken the step from a criminal def@@ en@@ der to a criminal purchase at the moment he began crimin@@ als . ”
his co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction led to a ho@@ p@@ eless com@@ promising and made him sus@@ cep@@ tible to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organized crime who instruc@@ ted him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .
d@@ it@@ ta has be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed this trust and tried to hide behind the fac@@ ade of his profes@@ sion .
the serious and organised crime unit of lan@@ cas@@ hire led the investigation of d@@ it@@ ta , which also led to a convic@@ tion in three cases on account of the pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and our judicial determination to strike .
this case should be a warning to crimin@@ als and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law .
we find them and bring them to justice .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was sent@@ enced to 14 years in prison after he declared himself guil@@ ty of con@@ spir@@ acy to her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine , and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
thir@@ ty-@@ five more people involved in the drugs trade were sent@@ enced to total sent@@ ences of 15@@ 3 years for drug off@@ ences .
d@@ it@@ ta published a section of questions and answers about himself , saying that his dream job is to represent clients in the death cell in america , to represent him in an un@@ equal way , to have dinner in america , to be the ultimate .
revolutionary work of church music
to conclude the celebra@@ tions on the occasion of its 16@@ 0-@@ year existence , the song w@@ re@@ ath dun@@ n@@ ingen will be fr@@ amed by two services of wor@@ ship with the &quot; deutsche mes@@ se &quot; by fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert .
after the great success of the musi@@ c@@ als &quot; rock my life &quot; , which attrac@@ ted the vie@@ wers in the spring of this year , the song w@@ re@@ ath will be completed by two religious services with the opening of the ju@@ bil@@ ee year .
on saturday , october 26 , this extraordinary fair will be held from 19 to the evening mass in the st. mar@@ tin@@ s@@ kir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday , 27 october at the church of god from 10.@@ 15 a.m.
the so-called german fair , entitled &quot; sing@@ ing to celebrate the holy victim of the fair &quot; , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual music work of the compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert dating from 18@@ 26 .
the fair is performed in the context of services , as the client jo@@ han@@ n phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann had in mind .
under the leadership of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir is accompanied by the br@@ ass group of the fre@@ ch@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n and no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di music association at the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach ’ s ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism sof@@ tens confidence
the elections to the par@@ ish council in 20@@ 15 will , for example , fundament@@ ally change in the h@@ as@@ l@@ ach ( se ) se@@ af@@ aring unit .
there is then only one joint par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ish districts .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the bodies of has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach prepared for the changes .
the basic decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese cannot be changed and it is up to the par@@ ish counc@@ ils to implement them as satisfac@@ tor@@ ily as possible .
the day has become particularly clear : ske@@ p@@ tic@@ ism about the new is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant , but growing , of confidence .
from the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 20@@ 15 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council , the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main se@@ af@@ aring teams were enough .
the new guidelines for se@@ af@@ are@@ rs in the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg were presented by the regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t .
subsequently , se has@@ l@@ ach , as a par@@ ish , will form a public law body that will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities hi@@ ther@@ to .
there will only be a joint par@@ ish council and a supervisory board in which the pri@@ est &apos;s power is represented .
at least two elected members are to be represented from each par@@ ish , and in the six par@@ ish districts so-called local teams are formed .
their task in future will be to promote church life in the place .
the question of the finances of the par@@ ish then became apparent in a great deal of discussion .
the innovations provide for the ear@@ marked funds to be re@@ tained for the purpose of the par@@ ish .
the li@@ abilities , on the other hand , pass to the entire municip@@ ality .
it was precisely with regard to the large planned investment , the commitment of which will then hit all the par@@ ish states , that there was great concern .
&quot; in the past , investment was also only made in projects that could be handled by the individual par@@ ish regions alone , &quot; said the par@@ ish chairman , brun@@ o prin@@ z@@ bach .
practical experience with a joint committee for five par@@ ish districts described bar@@ b@@ ar rit@@ ter , the chairman of the board of the sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ neu@@ ried se@@ al@@ ers unit .
they made their task in 2006 , &apos; one to become , five to stay &apos; and found that this was not so easy .
the h@@ as@@ l@@ ach se@@ al@@ wor@@ t@@ ship units then asked questions about the future composition and size of the common par@@ ish council and the practical work of the local teams .
the work will be fin@@ alised in subsequent meetings and will be adopted in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .
in the end , the par@@ ish council , michael sch@@ ö@@ ner , from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the se@@ af@@ aring unit , which was approved by a clear majority .
the electricity in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f is becoming more expensive .
the citizens of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f must prepare for higher electricity costs .
as the managing director of the municip@@ al works , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the south cou@@ ri@@ er , a family of four people will have to pay 70 to 90 euros in additional costs per year .
the main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the ee@@ g lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t hour .
this lev@@ y is re@@ established every year in october by the four operators of the major electricity routes .
these calcul@@ ate the additional costs you will inc@@ ur from the energy tur@@ n@@ around , which you can charge via a lev@@ y above the electricity price .
the municip@@ al works of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f form the last link in this chain .
the energy company ’ s supervisory board had even assumed a higher lev@@ y , as j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as reports , in its forec@@ asts .
now the figures would have to be calculated before the city works next week could inform their customers of the exact price increase .
&quot; we are starting to raise 1 cent plus x , &quot; says bi@@ as , where the figure will be closer to 2 c@@ ents .
permanent red light : watch for waiting time .
sometimes a light simply doesn &apos;t green .
the contact loo@@ p in the street does not react , or the light sign is def@@ ec@@ tive .
what should we do then - driving red ?
if a person has wa@@ ited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the att@@ or@@ ney r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker in the magazine &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; .
the waiting time must be &apos; adequate &apos; , which can be interpreted in different ways on a cas@@ e-@@ by-@@ case basis .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es to stay for at least five minutes before starting a distur@@ b@@ ance of the traffic light .
those who continue driving despite the red light , must be aware that they are entirely to blame for an accident caused by it .
those who toler@@ ate less than five minutes may not wait long enough , war@@ n bec@@ ker and point to a decision by the supreme court of ham@@ m .
in the case that was negotiated , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red light and had to answer for a neglig@@ ent infringement of red light .
the traffic light was not def@@ ec@@ tive , but turned to green a little later .
he was spa@@ red a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .
the municip@@ al council is delighted with the sound budget .
whenever municip@@ al meetings are about the household , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster has lau@@ gh@@ ed .
the municip@@ al s@@ ä@@ ck@@ l in her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen@@ -@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach is well filled and the administration has already been ign@@ oring debt since 2005 .
the 2012 financial year can also be seen as a complete success in this respect .
this was clear when the 2012 annual accounts were presented .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget , which amounts to around eur 7.@@ 6 million , was over eur 1 million higher than was planned .
the sur@@ plus of the administrative budget , with around eur 1.@@ 8 million , is also about eur 1 million above the approach .
it is mainly thanks to the sur@@ plus of higher industrial tax revenue and the community share in income tax .
the asset budget , too , was clearly higher than the planned values .
last year , it was eur 2.5 million , rather than the eur 1.5 million that was envis@@ aged .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher level of allocation from the administrative budget , &quot; says ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
as the 2012 financial year has under@@ gone less investment than planned , the allocation of reserves has also been higher .
overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around eur 2.@@ 1 million to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and her team for their good work .
&quot; one cannot sha@@ ke a piece of paper just out of his sle@@ eve , &quot; ger@@ ster p@@ raised the annual accounts .
he and the local counc@@ ils were obviously pleased with the good figures .
it may sound par@@ ado@@ x@@ ical , but it is these good figures that could soon cost the citizens de@@ arly .
due to the good financial situation the municip@@ ality has in the past been able to avoid high he@@ aps .
this in turn , however , according to ger@@ ster , subsidies have been cut by the country on a number of occasions .
these subsidies are condi@@ tional on having a variety of compensation levels .
among other things , the cities and municip@@ alities that apply for grants must have certain he@@ aps .
&quot; we have to look at the issue of lif@@ ting , as we are facing investments in the coming years , for which we would like to receive subsidies , &quot; ger@@ ster announced in this context .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter for 60 years in ch@@ or@@ us
at the age of 60 , hu@@ bert wer@@ mer &apos;s story at the ca@@ ec@@ ili@@ a male sing@@ ing club is almost twice as long as that of the her@@ b@@ s@@ fest , in which he was sole@@ m@@ n@@ ly hon@@ ored .
hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his male sing@@ ing club .
after 60 years he still enjoys sing@@ ing with the cho@@ ir , which has been won by now more than his loved ones .
wer@@ m@@ ter was also active in the association , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .
he received several awards for his commitment and commitment : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , pa@@ stor@@ al speaker on behalf of the c@@ ec@@ ili@@ en@@ ver@@ band ro@@ t@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart , also signed a letter of honour by j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr .
his sing@@ ers presented him with the certificate of the german cho@@ ir union and a eng@@ ra@@ ved tin plate .
the 3@@ 1st autumn festival took place in familiar railways : the m@@ g@@ v be@@ tra , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z salt ste@@ t@@ ten , the sing@@ er department ba@@ is@@ ingen and the local music club were invited .
the m@@ g@@ v vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen opened with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; im we@@ in@@ par@@ a@@ dies &quot; and &quot; fun@@ ny , i@@ hr bro@@ der &quot; .
in honour of their hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter they prepared a small stand - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .
the male sing@@ ing club be@@ tra also san@@ g classical cho@@ ir songs like &quot; hun@@ ter &apos;s bo@@ ys &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; far , far away &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song &quot; .
the song &apos;s cr@@ ane salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten caused the women &apos;s rate of the fe@@ ast with his mixed cho@@ ir and his women &apos;s group - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; .
the mixed cho@@ ir performed with the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k song &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; from an@@ tos g@@ us to foreign countries , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ se &quot; also returned to the foreign languages .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged by controversial media law
“ we are in a fri@@ ghten@@ ing situation and one may wonder : what is parliament ’ s dis@@ incentive to abol@@ ish judicial independence tomorrow ? ” , according to the newspaper , the draft law was not constitutional .
“ the law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very pun@@ ish@@ able and we reject it , ” said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ a@@ u , managing director of the capital group , to which capital ital@@ f@@ m also belongs , one of the most respected radio stations .
he said that the new media tri@@ bun@@ al “ will always be bi@@ ased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage ken@@ ya ’ s position in the global economy .
“ i hope the president list@@ ens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to parliament , ” he said .
according to the star newspaper , the government was str@@ ang@@ led by the new “ media effectively ” law , whereas the standard says that democracy and freedom of speech in ken@@ ya “ suffered a heavy b@@ low , ” and read as “ a draft . ”
the adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed islam@@ ists on the west@@ gate shopping centre in september .
the ken@@ y@@ an media caught the authorities ’ an@@ ger by publishing rec@@ ord@@ ings of security cameras that showed the units sent to the tat@@ ort sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly e@@ jec@@ ted the luxurious shopping centre .
police chief david ki@@ ma@@ i@@ y@@ o respon@@ ded by or@@ dering two journalists and a leading media representative to inter@@ ro@@ gate , even if the sub@@ po@@ ena was with@@ drawn after a cr@@ y from the media .
under the new law , media houses can be fined up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sch@@ ill@@ ings , and individual journalists with up to one million , and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press ac@@ cred@@ itation .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the right to conf@@ is@@ c@@ ate the pos@@ session of those affected if a penalty is not paid .
according to daily nation , “ a single pun@@ ishment can bank@@ ru@@ pt most radio stations ” .
moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a dev@@ ast@@ ating effect on ken@@ ya ’ s description of a “ lively blo@@ go@@ sphere ” .
if they sil@@ enced the media , politicians could do whatever they want with imp@@ unity .
“ no one will ever know it , ” wrote mu@@ t@@ um@@ a ma@@ thi@@ u , a journ@@ alist at the nation , who calls the ken@@ y@@ an media a decisive factor in public control .
“ leave politicians to themselves , lead the country into bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and return us to the time of hun@@ ters and collec@@ tors , ” he comm@@ ented .
ken@@ y@@ an legisl@@ ators have already been w@@ re@@ st@@ ling with public an@@ ger .
in may , they agreed to reverse the cuts imposed by the national pay commission , and to re@@ sume their def@@ en@@ sible sal@@ aries of around 5@@ 3@@ 2@@ ,000 sch@@ illing tax@@ -@@ free , which is the highest in the world every month .
bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ r@@ heim : a dream becomes true for the f@@ c .
the city and the football club were not in@@ ju@@ red by the official in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation cere@@ mony for the artificial tur@@ f sports square despite the cold weather and rain .
i think everyone would have liked to have had a more pleasant party on saturday , but peter did not want to play with it .
so all those who came without a um@@ bre@@ lla or could not hold one for any reason had an in@@ jury .
this was done by the musicians who fr@@ amed the fe@@ st@@ act , as well as by many speakers .
so the f@@ c chairman , al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , spoke of ful@@ filling a dream , got we@@ t .
his thanks were to the may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who was very committed to the implementation of the project , the municip@@ al council , the companies involved and the members of the association that contributed .
here lo@@ th@@ ar her@@ o , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f in particular .
the reti@@ red , who had been in the business of the company , laid 400 square meters of pav@@ ement for the new ways .
the land@@ tag@@ es@@ me@@ p kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach also acknowledged this remarkable volunte@@ er effort .
the district chairman of the south ba@@ dian football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r of the planning office , also gave the municip@@ al sports committee a few additional gre@@ etings .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p remin@@ ded us that rec@@ ur@@ ring weather conditions in the spring and autumn caused the original pit@@ ch to be set in such a way that it could not be played .
15 years ago , the first thought was given to the problem of building a third place at the football club premises or at the real@@ sch@@ u@@ le on the sal@@ in@@ en@@ see .
both were dis@@ car@@ ded again .
six years ago , thoughts were raised about creating an artificial tur@@ f sports ground , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .
concrete plans were included two years ago when the f@@ c took over the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in in@@ herit@@ ance , agreed to a cost contribution of eur 100 000 for the construction of the site and granted the country aid of eur 10@@ 4 000 .
in october 2012 , the municip@@ al council decided to take over the remaining eur 3@@ 56 000 in total costs of eur 5@@ 60 000 , summar@@ ising k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p .
the construction of the 68 times 10@@ 8 metres high artificial tur@@ f square started on june 4 .
during the construction phase lasting over three months , 3@@ 000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of earth were removed , half of which was used for the construction of a dir@@ t bike track .
the union and the sp@@ d continued their coalition negotiations on justice and home affairs .
the relevant working group met in berlin in the morning .
among other things , it is about direct democracy , bri@@ ber@@ y and the federal police .
the working group on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliber@@ ations this morning .
this should include the issue of dual citizenship , where both sides have oppos@@ ing ideas .
the sp@@ d wants to end the pressure on immi@@ grant children born in germany to choose one - the union ref@@ uses a double pass@@ port .
on the subject of transport , which is not on the agenda this friday , the sp@@ d backed its no to a tol@@ l for cars demanded by the c@@ su .
a vig@@ net@@ te is a &quot; fl@@ at@@ rate for multi@@ riding and thus eco@@ log@@ ically counter@@ productive , &quot; said the sp@@ d negoti@@ ator for transport , fl@@ ori@@ an pron@@ old , in a letter to his group .
there was the threat of alternative road transport , which are already priority areas for accidents .
moreover , the introduction of a tol@@ l for all cars would be only a first step from the point of view of pron@@ ol@@ ds .
&quot; there is a danger that the compensation for german@@ s will be cancelled at a later date , &quot; he said .

in an accident on thursday evening , a 3@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old car driver from a@@ ach@@ en was seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
according to police , a 4@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old from m@@ ü@@ sch was travelling by train at about 9.@@ 15 p.m. on the k@@ emp@@ en@@ er out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts in the direction of gre@@ fr@@ ath .
when the road was to the left , st. t@@ ö@@ n@@ is@@ er stra@@ ß@@ e , she missed the next car of the 3@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old .

the a@@ ach@@ en suffered severe in@@ jur@@ ies and had to be taken to hospital for treatment .
con@@ stan@@ z : accident barri@@ er at the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le@@ kre@@ is@@ el
the accident was caused by police when a 51 year old driver of a swiss seat i@@ bi@@ za was driving on thursday evening , around 8 p.m. , on the left lan@@ e of the two-@@ lan@@ e re@@ ic@@ hen@@ au@@ stra@@ ß@@ e .
shortly before the sch@@ än@@ z@@ le roun@@ d@@ about , he noticed that he was on the left bank in the direction of stro@@ me@@ y@@ er@@ s@@ dor@@ f@@ stras@@ se and changed to the right lan@@ e .
the bmw of a 23@@ -@@ year-@@ old con@@ stan@@ cer was brought together in this case .
the v@@ w pass@@ at of a 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old driving behind the bmw was also damaged .
in total , around 15@@ ,000 material damage was caused , and the police reported it .
the road had to be closed during the accident , it was further said .
airport vienna creates passenger calls from vienna airport .
mr max ma@@ i@@ er , please come to gate 24 .
the same sort of break@@ down will not happen at vienna airport in the future .
a large part of the lou@@ d@@ speaker break@@ through@@ s are thus dro@@ pped - the noise level is to be reduced so significantly .
the aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ man peter kle@@ em@@ ann announced to radio vienna , vienna airport is following an international trend with the recru@@ it@@ ment of announ@@ c@@ ements concerning individuals .
the airports in copenhagen , frankfurt or du@@ ba@@ i , for example , already do not make the noise .
by elimin@@ ating these announ@@ c@@ ements - on average around 200 personal calls by the speakers per day - in future , the aim is to be more calm at the airport .
&quot; experience has shown that these individual trans@@ missions were per@@ ceived relatively little , but at the same time all other information about changed flight times or departure times here is being lost a bit , &quot; says the radio@@ sen@@ der in the con@@ vers@@ ation .
high-@@ lan@@ der games on kal@@ ten@@ hof
besides the bra@@ ke car pul@@ ling with trac@@ tors , there is also a second competition at the autumn farm at the kal@@ ten@@ hof from september 6@@ th to 8@@ th .

&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter to the expan@@ se , &quot; explains organiz@@ er peter sa@@ ile .
the tr@@ un@@ k must be thro@@ wn ver@@ tically , over@@ turning and then straight to the ground .
this is assess@@ ed with most of the points .
when thro@@ wing a ch@@ est , the accuracy of the ch@@ est depends on the target .

milk and eg@@ g alternatives
ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion requires plant alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
p@@ ü@@ ri@@ ted to@@ f@@ u with vege@@ table cre@@ am , for example , is a quar@@ ker@@ set .
the vege@@ t@@ arian in@@ herit@@ ance is also called world ve@@ gan day on november 1 .
the vege@@ t@@ arian society in germany proposes a series of ve@@ gan alternatives on the occasion of the world ve@@ gan day on 1 november :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t las@@ se replaced by so@@ ja@@ jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .
instead of milk , so@@ ya , o@@ at , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk can be used .
be@@ at@@ able vege@@ table cre@@ am substitu@@ tes conventional wh@@ i@@ ps .
there are also plant alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
a half crus@@ hed , ri@@ pe ban@@ ana , for example , can replace an eg@@ g as a bin@@ der in a ca@@ ke .
50 gram@@ s of apple or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground le@@ ash see@@ ds plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable for this purpose .
ba@@ king p@@ ou@@ ches are made instead of eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of a te@@ as@@ po@@ on ba@@ king pow@@ der , a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of food star@@ ch and three spo@@ ons of min@@ eral water .
but 50 gram@@ s of so@@ ja@@ yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ k sto@@ ve can also fulfil this purpose .
ve@@ b@@ u reports that there are currently around 800 000 people in germany who eat ve@@ gan , i.e. purely vege@@ table .
sle@@ ep@@ less in new york
on their way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the students of the black forest gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um met the american city of new york .
after eight hours of flight , the city went straight to bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , which was reached on foot the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
here , a fascinating view of the world-@@ famous sky@@ line , which is a special attr@@ action in the evening light , was offered .
the time was dela@@ yed , so the students were almost 24 hours on their feet , but fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully ad@@ h@@ ering to the s@@ log@@ an &quot; the city does not sleep &quot; the day was decided at times square .
despite shut@@ down , the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty was reached by a fer@@ ry on the second day and was kno@@ c@@ ked on foot .
then , the financial center went on to the comm@@ em@@ or@@ ation of september 11 th around wall street .
on the third day , the students of the 3@@ 73 meter high observation platform of the emp@@ i@@ re-@@ state building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating city and enjoy the view .
then , the hec@@ tic hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of new york ’ s streets led through the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ f@@ ell@@ er center to central park , which provided an ideal opportunity to relax in the autumn sun .
after a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing everyday school at we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
this year , a hu@@ ber@@ tus fair will be celebrated on the nam@@ ing day of st. hu@@ ber@@ tus in the par@@ ish church of st. mar@@ ia on h@@ ü@@ ls@@ ber@@ g@@ stras@@ se .
st. hu@@ ber@@ tus was a ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter who was converted by a vision and later named bis@@ hop of li@@ è@@ ge .
the hun@@ ting hor@@ n b@@ low@@ ing group of hun@@ ting tri@@ be west@@ ph@@ alia , ch@@ ased by bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , is playing par@@ for@@ ce@@ hor@@ ns ( nature hor@@ ns in the mo@@ od ) according to old french me@@ lo@@ dies .
the bl@@ ades wear riding clothes because they mainly ac@@ company horses , horses and dog owners on the hun@@ t .
the f@@ es@@ tive fair will take place on sunday , november 3rd , at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ sch@@ l@@ ach sh@@ ines with a new caf@@ e .
one that invi@@ tes you to stay and come back .
one that wants to make the name a program .
according to the le@@ x@@ icon , dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is a psycho@@ logical phenomenon that mani@@ fe@@ sts itself in the feeling that it has experienced or seen a new situation .
in the event of the visit to the café at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in the district of kle@@ ve , in sight of the university of rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al , it does not have to remain at the pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
after all , the café with its beautiful name aims to make a real stay not only memor@@ able , but also an event@@ ful and unforgettable experience .
because it &apos;s just fun and just beautiful .
a gl@@ ance into the inner life at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the vie@@ wer a good feeling at first sight .
the ul@@ tra-@@ modern but not cool caf@@ é@@ -@@ ambi@@ ence looks like a place to feel good .
here the team spo@@ ils the guests with the foun@@ ders mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t@@ t and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the top with a variety of coffee and cock@@ tail vari@@ ations .
you can also enjoy delicious ca@@ kes or fres@@ h@@ ly prepared bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes .
the owners , both 33 years old , made a name for themselves before the opening of the lovely café am op@@ sch@@ la@@ g as a gastronom@@ ic : in k@@ ran@@ enburg they led the &quot; art lounge &quot; .
from moving to kle@@ ve , the friendly caf@@ e lovers are ho@@ ping for more audience .
not least through the university .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner emphasi@@ ses .
rather , the two here want to address young students as well as senior citizens and all age groups in between .
speaking of caf@@ e lovers .
the friendly owner couple stands behind the coffee pleasure .
enjoy the frag@@ rant hot br@@ ä@@ u in a variety of vari@@ ations .
expres@@ so@@ fan
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more the expres@@ so fan and mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ t@@ t the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino tr@@ in@@ ker .
&quot; and a bag@@ u@@ ette - that is my thing &quot; , tells the n@@ r@@ z .
two events took place in the bright café .
better said one .
the port festival was held outside rather - café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
but there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z@@ ab@@ end .
&quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; , found the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old .
but not everyone &apos;s business .
perhaps that is why dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a very special fan of event even@@ ings : &quot; you can &apos;t get it right for everyone &quot; .
and with an event i always only talk to those who are interested in the special event .
that is why events will be the exception .
&quot; we want to dis@@ ru@@ pt normal operation as little as possible &quot; .
let us say : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
in terms of the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the road , which is becoming a gastronom@@ ic m@@ ile .
to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ ver , the guests from near and far and the students who discover the ga@@ stro@@ me@@ ile and hence also the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u for themselves .

a day of than@@ k@@ s@@ giving at the m@@ g@@ v in din@@ ker
it was the 16@@ 5th anniversary of the foundation that the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; invited this year and 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves , were happy to come .
in the club premises of the restaurant &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; in din@@ ker , everyone enjoyed harmon@@ ious co@@ existence in the spirit of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the foundation festival is always the perfect celebr@@ ation to make hon@@ ours .
this time , writer ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er was delighted with the special award &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; .
&quot; you have not only written a lot for us , but you have also shot a lot of roun@@ ds for us , for which we are very grateful , &quot; says the chairman of the cho@@ ir er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir sam@@ ples by means of activity bus@@ hes were given to the cho@@ ir leader di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze with 44 participants , followed by hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st pi@@ er .
place five occupied no@@ ten@@ w@@ art ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner .
the board of directors was especially grateful to the team of vere@@ in ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , who once again had a very special menu and to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ kor@@ bert for the table decor@@ ation .
the m@@ g@@ v &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; meets for his regular cho@@ ir sam@@ ples at 7 : 45 pm in the club hall .
&quot; new san@@ ge@@ t-@@ looking vo@@ ices are always welcome &quot; , sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann said .
un announ@@ ces new targets in the fight against poverty
the united nations is now starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the millennium development goals to combat poverty announced 12 years ago .
in the run@@ -up to the un summit on sustainable development , which began in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro in the evening , austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the 20@@ 15 millennium .
they were included in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders , including mrs g@@ ill@@ ard , at the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”
“ i am pleased that the member states have agreed to start a process that aims to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .
“ these goals will build on our progress from the millennium development goals and form an integral part of the post-@@ 20@@ 15 framework .
i will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realise our vision of sustainable development goals , which are based on the success of the millennium goals . ”
although the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has been without victory for four mat@@ ches , the hand@@ ball upper league continues to be in good shape .
tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon has no doubt about this .
everyone remains fully motivated .
i hope , however , that we will finally win again .
&quot; i don &apos;t know how such a victory tas@@ tes any@@ more , &quot; mal@@ mon exp@@ ects his team to be successful at v@@ f@@ l fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k ii .
although the third li@@ ga reserve from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k has not yet broken out trees , mal@@ mon raises the fing@@ er in advance .
i have trained many players myself in the a-@@ youth .
that is why you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex@@ -@@ co@@ ach .
&quot; it is also important to wait and see if there is any rein@@ for@@ cement from the first one , &quot; the s@@ g-@@ co@@ ach explains .
to get back to the top of the line , the mal@@ mon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances .
especially in the cover work and the swit@@ ching game it was a lot of work .
there is also a defin@@ ite need for better opportunities .
so i hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break .
security concerns in moz@@ ambi@@ que are growing in the face of cl@@ ash@@ es between influ@@ ential person@@ alities .
thousands of people gathered in ma@@ pu@@ to ’ s centre under the wat@@ ch@@ ful eyes of the stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mach@@ el , the founder of the state , and moz@@ ambi@@ que ’ s first president , to call for peace in a rare public demonstration .
“ we want peace again , we want stability , ” said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , managing director of an investment company .
for fear of the country ’ s future , she has changed her clothes for a t-@@ shir@@ t with the in@@ scri@@ ption “ we demand security ” in portuguese and joined the crow@@ d on the capital ’ s independence square on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government and ren@@ am@@ o almost daily , which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially supported by the wh@@ ite@@ -@@ governed r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and later by the apar@@ the@@ id government of south africa in an effort to dest@@ ab@@ il@@ ise the country ’ s independent government .
after the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have wor@@ ried foreign investors and loc@@ als .
the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy is much at stake , because disco@@ vering huge depos@@ its of gas off the coast and north-@@ west coal could bring investment from more than $ 50 billion to italy from firms like rio t@@ into .
the ruling fre@@ li@@ mo party , the dominant force since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the ten@@ sions .
ren@@ am@@ o claims that the government pro@@ vo@@ ked the recent cl@@ ash@@ es by att@@ acking its members in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , a traditional ren@@ am@@ os strong@@ hold , on 17 october .
the attacks on the former re@@ be@@ ls es@@ cal@@ ated when government troops att@@ acked ren@@ am@@ o bases and tried to kill af@@ on@@ so dh@@ la@@ kam@@ o , the leader of the group , declared the group .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for the cl@@ ash@@ es and acc@@ uses the organization of having att@@ acked soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has tried to play down concerns about inst@@ ability .
to af@@ p , the french news agency , he said on wednesday that dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama regards himself as “ los@@ ers , ” who wants to “ use all his remaining powers to prove that he is . ”
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o empha@@ size that they want to avoid war .
but concerns have increased since ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was quo@@ ted as saying that ren@@ am@@ o gave up the 1992 peace agreement .
he told the ft that he meant that fre@@ lim@@ o no longer respected the agreement .
“ our vision is to re@@ start negotiations , and to do so seriously , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
earlier talks between the parties have done little to resolve the ten@@ sions fu@@ el@@ ed by a number of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
“ we have two adult men here ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) who cl@@ ash their heads , ” says joseph han@@ l@@ on , lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ ambi@@ que .
none of them is good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary conc@@ essions .
ren@@ am@@ o , who is pus@@ hing for electoral reform , has already said that she will bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t the november local elections .
presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a cr@@ ying movement to obtain conc@@ essions and financial benefits from the government .
ren@@ am@@ os ’ election succ@@ esses have been shr@@ in@@ king since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , founded by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , will probably improve mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ’ s demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tic@@ o de mo@@ ç@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) election .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a claims that gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za – whose re@@ sign@@ ation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .
“ he does not want a multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
it is un@@ clear what capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has made un@@ sett@@ ling attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-@@ south connections .
the most fi@@ ghts took place in the province of so@@ fal@@ a , which lies a few hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but which is located in be@@ ira , the port and the mining companies like rio t@@ into and v@@ va .
in june , rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after ren@@ am@@ o announced an attack on the line .
ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a respon@@ ded cau@@ ti@@ ously to the question of whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to “ war@@ n the international community that things are not good in moz@@ ambi@@ que , ” said ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a .
inst@@ ability has increased fru@@ stration with the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , because many people have already wor@@ ried about corruption , the s@@ lugg@@ ish wave of leadership .
“ people think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .
om@@ ar sul@@ tan@@ e , a demonstr@@ ator , said that people simply wanted stability .
“ no one is interested in ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ li@@ mo , they just want peace and us@@ able roads again , ” he said .
children should be taught my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as “ role models for life , ” says an author .
th@@ or ’ s stories showed that “ brut@@ al force has no chance of dealing with cle@@ ver tr@@ ic@@ ks , ” and the ar@@ tus leg@@ end demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .
but many of the my@@ ths are “ far too wild , too off@@ ensive , and sometimes too dir@@ ty to be taught in schools , ” which is why cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land ’ s selection of ag@@ e-@@ sensitive works for a “ old . ”
“ i think it is wonderful that my@@ ths and fol@@ kl@@ ore are already part of education in america , ” he said .
i have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .
he added that , for authors and teachers who are “ exc@@ es@@ sively di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic , ” children would “ dis@@ able ” completely , because in enter@@ taining stories , the messages would be “ sub@@ ver@@ ted . ”
cros@@ s@@ ley hol@@ land , who translated be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from the ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on language and author of the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and the british fol@@ k tal@@ es , said : “ you can keep it .
perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to deliver hope .
not everything needs to be simplified or lead to happy ending , but there is an im@@ man@@ ent sense of good and evil .
this must be presented in a sub@@ limin@@ al manner , through which history is revealed and not explained .
this is the old story of show instead of telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b is leaving fre@@ i@@ hof again
100 years ago he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b moved to his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , and on sunday his last years became alive in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; .
the many spec@@ t@@ ators were thr@@ illed by the extremely cur@@ ious scenery game .
from the arrival to the award of hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship to his death , scre@@ en@@ writer and han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b actor alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ tz@@ cy@@ k designed an enter@@ taining piece directed by the people of cor@@ k .
mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann took the audience with him through the ten different scenes , explained connections and brid@@ ged time jum@@ ps from youth to the appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on october 22 , 19@@ 13 han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b heim is entering his child@@ hood heav@@ en , in his open yard .
and then began the scene game , in which alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k once again sh@@ one in his par@@ ad@@ er@@ ol@@ le as the great son of the city .
he performed with the two chi@@ pp@@ ers and &quot; black forest fo@@ xes &quot; by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
he was not only received with much applause from the public , but his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine also welcomed him .
bil@@ ly sum@@ -@@ her@@ mann understood it incredi@@ bly well to take on the role of si@@ ster and gave her in m@@ im@@ ics and ge@@ st@@ ures of mon@@ strous life .
between the individual scenes the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ b@@ ach@@ er farmers &apos; band played selected music mat@@ ching to the final stage .
in order to grant hon@@ or@@ ary citizenship , has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s may@@ or he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler was hon@@ ored , who represented the then inc@@ um@@ b@@ ent h@@ ä@@ t@@ ti@@ ch , along with a part of the town council .
their as@@ sumption was followed by the tri@@ alo@@ gue sing@@ ers , who led han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b to the proc@@ lam@@ ation : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , there are youth mem@@ ories of my own tri@@ alo@@ gue again alive &quot; .
with their song &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; they enjoyed the public in the fre@@ i@@ hof as well as the stor@@ k@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der with their l@@ oud &quot; out , out &quot; .
his criticism of the church of the office was expressed at the time by han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b , as did his concerns about the exc@@ esses in agriculture , the consequences of industri@@ alisation or the effects of war .
in the home , behind his tom@@ b cha@@ pel on the brand near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , he found his re@@ sting place .
&quot; an un@@ settled spirit had finally found his calm and had gone away fore@@ ver , &quot; it was said at the end of the scene game .
much applause and many p@@ raise were given by the audience for the performance .
bas@@ ket@@ ball : the hope of nec@@ k@@ ar gi@@ ants gro@@ ws
the chan@@ ces of the s@@ por@@ tive lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ bur@@ ger bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ er remaining in league have increased .
if there is a wil@@ d@@ card procedure , then the nec@@ k@@ ar gi@@ ants will now have a competi@@ tor less .
the bas@@ ket@@ ball project hamburg to@@ wers ref@@ ra@@ ins from applying for a possible re@@ ar seat .
&quot; we will not participate in the wil@@ d@@ card process , &quot; said ex@@ -@@ national player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been setting up the concept of a professional club in the han@@ se@@ atic city since 2012 .
the first bre@@ a@@ thing was not heard from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; we did not deal with the wil@@ d@@ card process until it was established that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf would not be granted a licence , &quot; said nec@@ k@@ ar giant bo@@ ss alexander re@@ il of our newspaper .
until may 23 , the rising german football league ( d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf bas@@ ket ) can still submit documents to the arbitr@@ ation court and prove its economic su@@ it@@ ability for the league .
the r@@ hin@@ eland has been denied a licence twice , however .
the arbitr@@ ation court is the last instance .

snow@@ den could also say in russia
former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den could also make statements in the us late office in his russian asylum .
representatives of the federal public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in person in russia .

the company has several iron in the fire at its location .
besides the coal import , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard also focuses on wind supply logistics .
black sh@@ imm@@ ers the coal on the storage area in front of the dam .
two massive blue p@@ it bul@@ bs and re@@ char@@ ge@@ able units distribute or load the coal here as necessary .
every time the en@@ velo@@ pe is moving , a sh@@ imm@@ ering warning noise is heard over the ter@@ rain .
&quot; the signals are safe and legally required , &quot; says mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
unfortunately , with un@@ favourable wind , this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .
he takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has cont@@ acted the people concerned , says the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals qui@@ e@@ ter with technical measures .
he continues to rely on open dialogue with his neighbours .
mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has a lot to do in front of the site .
with the expansion of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard continues to rely on the import of coal for power plants and is one of the great in this sector in europe .
thanks to the dec@@ k tu@@ b at the front terminal , which is 18@@ .@@ 5 metres deep , ca@@ pe@@ si@@ ze bul@@ k@@ carri@@ ers can be handled here long ago .
&quot; this year we want to break the 3 million ton@@ ne mark in the en@@ velo@@ pe , &quot; sch@@ re@@ ll said .
besides the e@@ on power plant on the ground , the imported coal is going to power plants in the in@@ land .
if the g@@ d@@ f su@@ e@@ z power station were to go to the gri@@ d , it would be realistic to import more than 5 million tonnes of coal per year .
the three ships &apos; char@@ gers on the bridge and the second transport bel@@ t could create up to 10 million .
bav@@ aria ’ s bas@@ ket@@ ball team was optim@@ istic despite its first defe@@ at .
even the first defe@@ at in the euro@@ league could not di@@ min@@ ish the enormous optim@@ ism of the bas@@ ket@@ ball players of the f@@ c bay@@ er@@ n munich .
&quot; no one can pro@@ hi@@ bit us from winning even against the best team in europe over the past two years , &quot; said bay@@ ern@@ -@@ co@@ ach s@@ ve@@ tis@@ la@@ v pe@@ sic , after the unfortunate 8@@ 3 : 88 .
we sent the message : bas@@ ket@@ ball is also in munich !
the first appearance in the european royal class in munich sold very well for a long time , but was simply not clari@@ fied enough in the decisive stages .
the guests first managed to convert a 15@@ -@@ point back@@ ward 13 minutes before the end of the tour into a guided tour before pi@@ ra@@ eu@@ s gave the game a new turn .
&quot; we fought incredi@@ bly against the two euro@@ league champi@@ ons , but then again made rec@@ k@@ less mistakes , &quot; said bav@@ arian pro y@@ ass@@ in id@@ bi@@ hi .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .

ben green@@ man : the new york com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker
one might say that new york city is the birth@@ place of stand@@ -up com@@ edy in america : just over a hundred years ago , the vari@@ e@@ te@@ artist frank fa@@ y , who worked as a conf@@ é@@ ren@@ ci@@ er at the palace , began .
fa@@ ys innovation has been expanded over the years , as was the latest innovation at the new york com@@ edy festival .
founded and directed by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , founder of the stand@@ -up institution car@@ ol@@ ines , this year the festival celebra@@ tes its t@@ enth anniversary with more than six@@ ty shows in small clubs .
“ most of these head@@ lin@@ ers began with car@@ ol@@ ines and became more successful until they were eventually too well known to perform in a club , ” said h@@ ir@@ sch .
we have designed this festival so that we can continue working with you .
this year ’ s event will include w@@ anda sy@@ kes , ka@@ thy gri@@ ff@@ in and bill ma@@ her as well as “ stand up for her@@ oes ” , an annual music and com@@ edy event by arm@@ ory spr@@ uc@@ y .
the festival has also brought the com@@ edy world to life .
a number of com@@ edi@@ ans who participate in the festival this year have become known on a rather un@@ conventional way , such as television programmes on smaller channels such as com@@ edy central , f@@ x and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll was known with a sit@@ com on cable television ( the ir@@ onic sli@@ p@@ per@@ y fant@@ as@@ y football series “ the league ” on f@@ x@@ x ) and now has his own ske@@ tch show .
jen@@ ny s@@ late was part of the occupation at both “ saturday night live ” and “ parks and recre@@ ation ” , although she is best known for her vir@@ al video series “ mar@@ cel on the shell with shoes . ”
both k@@ roll , s@@ late and other young com@@ edi@@ ans with characteristic vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ real pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the ir@@ onic , r@@ aci@@ ally concentrated ca@@ us@@ ative issues are w. k@@ au@@ ma@@ -@@ s@@ eu@@ ma .
one of the greatest mag@@ net visitors to the festival is an interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talks to lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg began as a stand@@ -up com@@ edi@@ an , but has developed into a prestigious television and film director as well as an un@@ official com@@ edy hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an .
from 2005 to 2007 he ho@@ sted a tv programme entitled “ sit down com@@ edy with david ste@@ in@@ berg ” at tv land .
the meeting will take place in the town hall in the heart of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
“ the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of lar@@ ry ’ s total work , ” ste@@ in@@ berg said .
he told me when he is here , then he sometimes goes through the street between two buildings and thin@@ ks : he@@ y , if i lose all my money , then i might live here .
iran content with the process of nuclear negotiations
iran is happy with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to powers and germany .
&quot; after years of agreement with the international atom@@ ic energy agency to red@@ ress the differences of recent years , &quot; foreign minister mo@@ ham@@ med sha@@ wa@@ d s@@ ar@@ if wrote on his fac@@ e@@ book@@ shop page .
it would be a long way off , but the chief negoti@@ ator is satisfied with the negotiation process and optim@@ istic that both sides will eventually find a solution .
ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay ’ s dr@@ ama : young people kill gam@@ bling cham@@ bers with mac@@ he@@ te
two children ad@@ mitted in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay the murder of a 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the two young bo@@ ys 14 and 12 had invited their victims to go bird hun@@ ting with them .
armed with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they pic@@ ked up the 11 year old on tuesday and thre@@ w the cor@@ pse into a well , the newspaper &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; reported on thursday .
they would then have played football in front of their homes in a work@@ ing-@@ class quarter .
the cor@@ pse was found in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach pun@@ ta del est@@ e .
as an ali@@ bi , a fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ old half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger man who took her with him should say that she had been sex@@ ually att@@ acked by the boy .
but when the girl described the incident before the police without men@@ tioning an attack against her , the two bo@@ ys ad@@ mitted the deliber@@ ate killing of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the older , among other reasons , mentioned ri@@ val@@ ry in the football match .
he was provi@@ sion@@ ally ad@@ mitted to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric youth institute .
p@@ im@@ ps must be j@@ ail@@ ed
due to explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings , p@@ im@@ ps , threats , insul@@ ts and dangerous physical in@@ jury , the district court of kon@@ stan@@ z has sent@@ enced a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years imprison@@ ment .
the former german military soldi@@ er , who worked as a do@@ or@@ man after two missions in afghanistan , made a conf@@ ession in the course of a process agreement .
in five cases , he has therefore met women via internet or telephone contacts , which he sent out , against their will , after a few weeks .
he used to resi@@ st violence and threats .
he re@@ tained the income of women , some of whom he earned for years .
by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating mobile phones and si@@ m cards , he sub@@ ordin@@ ated women &apos;s contacts to the outside world .
together with a colleague who conve@@ yed women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the sou@@ th@@ west .
there he had some monitoring of them to control their revenue .
in court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering a severe tra@@ um@@ a after fellow members in afghanistan died next to him in an explo@@ sion .
after a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert indicated great doubt about mental constra@@ int and thus about limited guil@@ t capacity , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old made a comprehensive conf@@ ession .
the court had to hear no more of the women who had suffered damage .
as one cri@@ p@@ o official reported , at least four more cases of explo@@ it@@ ative trafficking in human beings were identified after an initial notification by telephone surveillance .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted talks were marked by high aggres@@ sion .
in subsequent inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations , the in@@ ju@@ red party would have confirmed their mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom .
another witness , in which one of the women had discovered blue spots on the whole body , has not made any statement to this day .
it is a &apos; completely broken person@@ ality &apos; which sees violence and exploitation in this profes@@ sion as normal .
the accused regre@@ t@@ ted his behaviour yesterday .
&quot; he has dis@@ integrated from these cir@@ cles and wants to lead a normal life after being imprison@@ ed , &quot; he said .
oil prices continue to reach $ 96 per bar@@ re@@ l
the price of oil continued to fall on friday , after wor@@ ries about a high supply over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed a report that increased china ’ s ener@@ g@@ y-@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector .
the reference cru@@ de oil for deli@@ veries in december fell by 14 c@@ ents to 9@@ 6.@@ 24 usd per bar@@ re@@ l in europe in the late morning of the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange .
the contract fell by 39 c@@ ents on thursday , which meant a fall in the price of 5.@@ 8 % in october .
the large offer of cru@@ de oil has weigh@@ ed down prices in recent weeks .
the us department of energy said on wednesday that the us supply increased by 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over five weeks , the supply had increased by 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but on friday , there were indic@@ ations of increased demand by two reports of an increase in chinese manufacturing activity .
this suggests a continued recovery in china ’ s economy , which had grown to 7.@@ 8 % in the third quarter , having been at its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades .
the b@@ rent variety cru@@ de oil , a reference value for international cru@@ de oil also used by us re@@ fin@@ eries , fell from usd 26 per cent to usd 10@@ l at the ice exchange in london .
court blocks decision on the n@@ y@@ p@@ d stop and fr@@ is@@ k directive
a federal appeal court in the us bloc@@ ked the order of a judge on thursday , who had called for changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program ( “ stop and search ” ) of the new york police department .
the 2nd us court of appeal declared that jud@@ ges sh@@ ira sch@@ end@@ lin ’ s decisions would be suspended until a decision was made on the city ’ s appeal .
the judge had rul@@ ed in august that the city was in breach of the constitution with the way in which the program for stop@@ ping and consulting people was implemented .
the city appe@@ aled against its assessment and the re@@ medi@@ es imposed , including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to assist the police in amending its directive and the relevant training programme .
the court of appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension on tuesday .
the appeal report stated that the judge had to be reli@@ ev@@ ed of the case , since it had vio@@ lated the code of conduct for u.s. jud@@ ges by speci@@ fying that a judge should avoid the appearance of a public party in court of a series ;
the judge had rul@@ ed that police officers were viol@@ ating the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were un@@ reason@@ ably targeted by black and latin american men with the stop and fres@@ co programme .
she appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms in directives , training , and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with bo@@ d@@ ily cameras carried out in areas where most controls were carried out .
in august , the city of new york agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing names and addresses of people who were released after police control .
an oral negotiation on the appointment of the city is planned after 14 march 20@@ 14 .
the stop and fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tic has been critic@@ ised by a number of civil rights def@@ enders .
such controls have ex@@ isted for decades , but the number of recorded checks during the term of the par@@ tis@@ an may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg rose to an all-@@ time high of 6@@ 8@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 30 of them in 2011 , latin america .
in 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities brought legal action , which became a collective action .
sup@@ porters of changes to the stop and fr@@ is@@ k program of the n@@ y@@ p@@ d say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more tru@@ st@@ worthy and effective police force , as well as using the presidential way others affect .
oppon@@ ents believe that change would slow down police mor@@ ality , but not crime ; money would also be was@@ ted and the wider problem of a police force that was put under pressure after thousands of jobs were lost in the last decade .
the judge pointed out that she did not end the stop and fr@@ is@@ k practice , which was constitutional , but merely re@@ forming the way in which the n@@ y@@ p@@ d implemented its controls .
the happ@@ iness of the dre@@ aming cam@@ els
lu@@ ck is an oasis that only dreams can succeed in achieving .
with this be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom , the first chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination of the association &quot; helping hands &quot; .
on saturday afternoon the t@@ enth anniversary of the association was celebrated , which has already had considerable succ@@ esses .
the first chairman , hen@@ ne , reported in detail about the work of the association .
he himself was in maur@@ it@@ ania in the k@@ he@@ ij@@ k-@@ z@@ a@@ jet hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t in 2004 .
as a result , further cooperation developed and the gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist hen@@ ne carried out numerous operations on site during several trips .
during the speeches , pictures of the missions were shown on a large screen , so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the abo@@ ve-@@ mentioned actions .
the deser@@ t vehicle of the association was also shown .
it is a former federal border guard .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former o@@ b of n@@ ag@@ old , proposed that this vehicle be equipped with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and is now planning to work with the association in an advisory capacity , according to hen@@ ne .
in 2008 , sch@@ le@@ e@@ h , a be@@ re@@ av@@ ing district in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , created the hospital in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a district of mis@@ ery on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of the capital - hon@@ or@@ ary .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother ’ s child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t .
particularly interesting in times when the na@@ gold birth clin@@ ic is to be we@@ gra@@ tion@@ alized .
one lear@@ ns a lot in africa as a medical practi@@ tion@@ er , according to hen@@ ne , for example , de@@ to@@ xi@@ fication against bur@@ n-@@ out .
the country &apos;s political un@@ rest has prevented us from doing as many trips as planned , but many medical professionals came to germany to host them in various areas .
in addition , contain@@ ers are regularly sent to africa , including medical equipment , medicines , association material , hospital beds and gl@@ asses in march of this year .
mi@@ ti@@ ni@@ ti@@ ator h@@ ans jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself delivered abun@@ dant local colour , telling from maur@@ it@@ ania of the traditional mer@@ ce@@ des vehicles that were converted into mobile br@@ ick bar@@ ns .
his personal mo@@ tives were his work in the field of aud@@ iting as a young member of parliament .
when he realized how much money was lost on the way , he decided to help afric@@ ans control a budget by the people .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also stressed that global economy also requires global love of human beings .
it should also be borne in mind that africa is closer than some think .
from gran can@@ aria it is not far from africa .
cou@@ l@@ son used phone h@@ acking to check a tip for a phone call .
the former news of the word editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son alle@@ ge@@ dly used “ telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation ” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an aff@@ air of the then minister of home affairs .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c declared to the old b@@ ail@@ ey court that news of the world had heard a false rum@@ or in may 2005 that clar@@ ke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advis@@ or . ”
the newspaper ordered the private detec@@ tive gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire to h@@ ack pa@@ w@@ l@@ b@@ ys vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , and persecu@@ ted them , but cou@@ l@@ son called them , and left them as it did , as it did .
&quot; according to the prosecu@@ tor , cou@@ l@@ son , now the editor of the no@@ tw@@ en , is not one who stands before the apartment of people and hopes to see them in fresh de@@ ed , but one of the people who respon@@ ded .
he said no@@ tw@@ w use three methods to investigate stories investi@@ ga@@ tively : telephone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the publish@@ er is personally involved in the third method .
he evi@@ d@@ ently knows about the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .
what about the first ?
does he know about telephone h@@ acking ?
he den@@ ies that , but we say , “ and whether he knew about it . ”
rum@@ ors about an aff@@ air clar@@ kes were first pic@@ ked up by the feature ed@@ it@@ orial team of no@@ tw@@ w , a source that was sex@@ ually interested in pa@@ w@@ l@@ by , “ do not waste your time .
a band with vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s from your phone of at least three occasions was secured in mul@@ ca@@ i@@ res apartment in august 2006 .
the investig@@ ators also found entries on the detec@@ tive computer where pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster were stored as “ projects . ”
when the sear@@ ches went , the grand@@ parents received anonymous calls from pa@@ w@@ l@@ by asking for information about them , ed@@ is explained .
meanwhile , former chief fre@@ porter ne@@ ville thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and the former re@@ porter james wea@@ ther@@ up supervis@@ ed the surveillance of pa@@ w@@ l@@ by ’ s movements .
on 18 june 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son left her with a vo@@ ic@@ email with the following content : “ i have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which i would like to talk about with charles . ”
ed@@ is explained that cou@@ l@@ son ’ s activities at this story were followed by the same pattern as other important person@@ alities , such as former home secretary david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the cr@@ um@@ b@@ les heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t had to face a married woman because of an aff@@ air when he had been married to the co-@@ accused re@@ be@@ ka@@ h bro@@ o@@ ks .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks are den@@ ying having con@@ signed themselves to h@@ acking phones between october 3 , 2000 and august 9 , 2006 .
mul@@ ca@@ ire , thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and wea@@ ther@@ up have ad@@ mitted the telephone h@@ acking .
in protest against the planned empire tax , french football will indeed go through the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a meeting of conciliation is coming to an end without results .
in the conflict over the empire tax , the french government and professional football have been st@@ uck in a dead end after a failed meeting of arbitr@@ ation .
although president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de received representatives of the association and association at the paris é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , he also heard their complaints .
but he refused to pay football from the planned 75 % lev@@ y on in@@ comes of more than one million euros per year , which all firms in the country are expected to pay for two years from 20@@ 14 .
the other side also remained tough .
the strike announced for the end of november will now be carried through , announced by the head association of professional clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel .
the mat@@ ches in li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 , scheduled between november 29 and december 2 , will therefore be cancelled .
cr@@ an@@ es : no absolute protection possible
&quot; we want to involve the inhabitants in planning early &quot; , may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler opened the ci@@ vic information event on the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
around 80 participants had come to the municip@@ al hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .
h@@ ä@@ us@@ s@@ ler made it clear : &quot; the final decisions are made by the members of the council of the municip@@ al authorities &quot; .
the floo@@ ds that hit the ch@@ ick@@ ens un@@ prepared on 15 may 2009 were a dr@@ astic event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , according to h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
a river bas@@ in investigation had been commission@@ ed with the neighbouring town of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which is now the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in ge@@ ch@@ ingen .
&quot; the protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal , &quot; says h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
the planning is based on the protection against floo@@ ds which are expected every 100 years according to the german weather service .
climate change is taken into account by a 15 % sur@@ charge .
in specialist cir@@ cles , this is called &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the water mass@@ es , which caused considerable damage in ge@@ ch@@ ingen in 2009 , were equivalent to a 10@@ 00@@ -@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , &quot; says h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler .
to protect h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma , investments in ge@@ si@@ ch@@ ingen will be required to the tun@@ e of around eur 4 million , with the municip@@ ality receiving state subsidies of around 70 percent .
however , mr h@@ ä@@ ß@@ ler pointed out that there would only be support if an overall approach were implemented .
the community must be involved .
an expensive planning and approval procedure must be completed .
at best , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
among other things , the protection concept presented last week in the municip@@ al council ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the flow of the ir@@ m river from the tri@@ bal valley .
following the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns into play .
among other things , it was ques@@ tioned why there were no plans for more dam@@ s and re@@ stra@@ int pools to protect the place .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , the technical plan@@ ner of the commission@@ ed engineering office wal@@ d and cor@@ be from h@@ ü@@ gel@@ sh@@ ei@@ m , who presented the concept , stressed that it required the interaction of all presented measures to achieve the sum .
in addition , one should be held to find the most econom@@ ical solution , according to jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d von wal@@ d and cor@@ be .
there was dis@@ quiet among al@@ t@@ ars who , even in normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms , are constantly suffering from cong@@ es@@ tion in the channel network .
the problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken .
however , mr h@@ ä@@ us@@ s@@ ler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flo@@ od protection and that this should not be mixed .
the municip@@ ality is obliged to interpre@@ t the channel network in such a way that two to three years of reg@@ ener@@ ation events could be sustained .
to dimen@@ sion@@ ing the se@@ wage channels would dev@@ our millions .
serious in@@ jury after cr@@ ash
in the early friday afternoon , on the provin@@ cial road 44 near rev@@ ens@@ dorf , two drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a fron@@ tal col@@ li@@ sion .
the police immediately closed the road completely , but could not say much about the accident .
however , there are different testi@@ mon@@ i@@ als that should be evalu@@ ated first .
the n@@ ine@@ te@@ en@@ th-@@ old len@@ ker of a v@@ w golf was on the way to rev@@ ens@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f came to her with his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
both vehicles cr@@ ash@@ ed together , with the woman tr@@ app@@ ed so badly that the fire bri@@ g@@ ade took almost half an hour to get them out of the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k .
the cause of the accident was initially un@@ explained .
both were un@@ happy with the situation in nearby hospit@@ als .
the track was closed for about two hours .
it could be called the do@@ sto@@ y@@ ev@@ sky of the united states .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a go@@ d-@@ see@@ ker , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ c@@ ist , his nov@@ els and stories also have something ser@@ ial .
the rela@@ tivity in the ou@@ ter world is ast@@ on@@ ishing : the sta@@ ining eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and , just as f@@ jo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ je@@ w@@ ski , with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre , can be understood as the founder and apo@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul , phili@@ p k. dic@@ k is considered to be an american pro@@ ph@@ et .
some tit@@ les have been published by he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g , the ha@@ ff@@ man@@ s cas@@ set@@ te with the 1@@ 18 nar@@ ra@@ tions distribu@@ tes two thousand .
dic@@ k explains america - the real@@ m of breathtaking technical progress , cou@@ pled with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , security mad@@ ness , and the belief that it is chosen .
dic@@ k had a religious experience , his late books read like a mix@@ ture of the rev@@ el@@ ation of john and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , drugs had added his brain .
he has cap@@ tured , early on , that the computers are divi@@ sions .
he wrote a the@@ ology of the computer and asked what distingu@@ ishes a person from a machine that cre@@ ator from his creature .
that is the bl@@ ade run@@ ner problem .
that is killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories inspired film directors such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg .
this story is now particularly significant .
the &quot; minority report &quot; dates from 195@@ 6 , it ex@@ u@@ des the sm@@ ell of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ al .
the principle of pre-@@ crime is being developed here , that is , what is now more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine of the white house .
in dic@@ k &apos;s world , which is like our sho@@ cking , mu@@ t@@ ants look to the future - and the police are rising .
&quot; we collect individuals who have not infring@@ ed any law , &quot; says the head of the authority .
&quot; we shall take them to us before they can commit a violent crime &quot; .
and : &quot; there are no serious crimin@@ als in our society , for which we have a prison camp full of pes@@ u@@ do@@ crimin@@ als &quot; .
they assume that the worst is happening and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice .
dic@@ k ’ s nar@@ ra@@ tive looks like the blue@@ print for the anti-@@ terrorism laws and the inter@@ ro@@ gation of the n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of the attack : that is how obama ’ s dr@@ one philosophy and practice works .
but dic@@ k &apos;s story is not over .
the police chief compla@@ ins that there is no separation of powers , the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state .
the supervis@@ or will then be monitored and transferred to a future crime .
the system is going through .
it is perfect , but it is lying .
it inv@@ ents its own pre@@ requi@@ sites .
not only does it accept errors and sacrif@@ ices , but it buil@@ ds on them .
the system creates the danger it is fighting .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k reads : &quot; coming closer to the truth .
mer@@ kel ’ s late ga@@ ff@@ es in russia
former us intelligence expert ed@@ ward snow@@ den could also make statements in the us sp@@ ä@@ ff@@ ä@@ h@@ ä@@ ff@@ ä@@ re about chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel in his russian asylum .
representatives of the german bar association could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in person in russia , reported the agency inter@@ fax .
previously , the green member of the federal parliament , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , was the first german politici@@ an to meet snow@@ den in moscow yesterday to talk to him about the aff@@ air .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations reinforce company par@@ an@@ o@@ ia because of state surveillance .
on a mil@@ d day at the end of august , a german police helicop@@ ter fle@@ w deep across the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt am main , germany ’ s financial capital .
at the instruc@@ tion of the federal office for constitutional protection and counter@@ -@@ terrorism ( b@@ v@@ t ) , the german internal security service , he should photo@@ graph the roof of the us post , which is less than 5 km from the european central bank .
according to german media , the b@@ v@@ t wanted to prove the existence of surveillance an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action led to a change of wording between the usa and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , insi@@ sted again in september that the us could not use sp@@ ying abroad , “ to engage foreign companies in the business secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of us companies . ”
but since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the former wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , began publishing his cor@@ p@@ us of us surveillance secre@@ ts , european governments and entreprene@@ urs have become sure to stop being the director .
the us national security agency has reported that petro@@ b@@ as , a braz@@ ili@@ an oil company , has been sp@@ ying on data from american cl@@ oud providers , including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o , for the sake of state surveillance .
the bar@@ re@@ l to over@@ flow brought the rev@@ el@@ ation that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel ’ s phone was mu@@ d@@ d@@ led , perhaps for ten years .
if the most powerful person in europe can target , then it is clear that corporate management too is potential targets .
snow@@ den has made intensive cooperation between us secret services and companies transparent .
i believe that it is possible for these data to be used for mutual benefit .
“ germany must wake up , ” explains oli@@ ver gr@@ ü@@ n , president of bit@@ mi , who represents small and medium-sized it companies in germany .
german companies believe that the us was now almost as much a risk as china in industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , a survey published by the consult@@ ant company ey in july .
but the documents le@@ ak@@ ed by snow@@ den have not shown that the us has passed on the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu l@@ acked certain it and internet opportunities and that it should reduce its dependence on the us .
companies are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g proposed that we should build a german google .
i can only close my eyes and slowly re@@ open them ...
“ this doesn ’ t work , ” says h@@ as@@ so plat@@ ner , chairman of the german software manufacturer sap .
if a strong european it industry had been wanted , it should not have been allowed to die out 20 years ago .
everything in germany is subsid@@ ised , from coal to cars to agriculture .
everything except the it industry .
nevertheless , the range and technical re@@ fin@@ ement of the us sp@@ ying authorities revealed by the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations have sho@@ c@@ ked firms that had previously seen the biggest sp@@ y risk in china .
cl@@ oud compu@@ ting is under@@ going a major change , because european business leaders are more aware that data stored in the us is subject to jurisdiction there and are therefore potentially at risk .
according to a survey conducted by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trading institution , about ten percent of us dat@@ a-@@ mining operations with pris@@ m members were dis@@ closed after the rev@@ el@@ ations about us dat@@ a-@@ mining operations .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , depu@@ ty managing director of sap , says : “ we see a new question from customers who did not exist a year ago – it says : where will my data be stored and can you guarantee ?
many german corporate leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew , namely that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most valuable secre@@ ts and therefore need to monitor them at all costs .
the fact that economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age is taking place is no surprise .
that has always been the case .
“ it has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundament@@ ally through the current discussion , ” says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chairman of the chemical company bas@@ f .
the americans are sp@@ ying us on commercial and industrial issues , just as we are doing , because it is in the national interest to defend our companies .
corporate governance usually does not bo@@ ast of the counter@@ measures that have been taken , because that gives att@@ ack@@ ers advantages .
the staff in large companies have long been saying that taking a free usb stick on a fair or leaving a lap@@ top in the hotel room is not advis@@ able , to put it mil@@ dly .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ ber@@ k , member of the board of directors of auto@@ producer au@@ di , says that it has been standard practice for years to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can not be used as e@@ av@@ es@@ dro@@ pping devices .
the german b@@ v@@ t advis@@ es execu@@ tives to use simple prepa@@ id phones when they go abroad , because smar@@ t@@ phones may be com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id phones are thro@@ wn away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are world leaders in their nic@@ he markets .
“ small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience , the staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secre@@ ts against un@@ authorised access , ” the b@@ v@@ t war@@ ns in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own companies against economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
according to the washington post , in february , france , russia , and israel were ran@@ ked second of the countries that used to obtain h@@ acking economic data .
a member of the board of a german blue chi@@ p company agreed when it came to es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , “ the french are the worst ” .
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french domestic intelligence service d@@ cr@@ l , was quo@@ ted in an interview this month , saying : “ the secret services know very well that all countries are fighting , even if they are in . ”

parents of a geor@@ gian te@@ en@@ ager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
the parents of the te@@ en@@ ager , whose body was found in a ro@@ lled r@@ ing@@ er@@ m@@ at in the gym of his high school , are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , the family law@@ yer declared on thursday .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son from val@@ do@@ sta in the state of georgia in the us was found in a well-@@ placed m@@ at on 11 january , standing behind the grand@@ stand in the school gym .
low@@ n@@ des county ’ s investig@@ ators concluded that jo@@ hn@@ son died in a tragic accident , which the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old ’ s family doubts .
“ they are convinced that their son was mur@@ dered , ” said ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , the law@@ yer of ken@@ ne@@ th and j@@ acqu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , to fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they would never have believed that he had died as the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
“ they believe that it is not logical to viol@@ ate the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense , ” says cr@@ um@@ p .
rather , they are convinced that the truth will be covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .
“ her son went to school for learning and came back in the body bag , ” he comm@@ ented .
us prosecu@@ tor michael mo@@ ore said on thursday that there would be a formal investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , as a number of important issues remain un@@ resolved .
what was the cause of death ?
is his death a crime ?
this was explained at a press conference on thursday afternoon .
i am following the facts in which direction they are heading .
my aim is to find out the truth .
“ i believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .
mo@@ ore explained to re@@ porters that the initial au@@ top@@ sy indicates that jo@@ hn@@ son died as a result of a “ posi@@ tion-@@ related suff@@ oc@@ ation . ”
a second au@@ top@@ sy , however , has produced another cause of death , according to mo@@ ore .
“ there are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .
mo@@ ore added that if there was sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the death of jo@@ hn@@ son , he would instruc@@ t the f@@ bi to carry out the investigation .
a representative of the county sh@@ eri@@ ff authority was not ready to comment immediately on our question on thursday .
a court in southern georgia ordered on wednesday that the authorities must release all surveillance videos that the investig@@ ators have checked .
the te@@ en@@ ager ’ s parents said that they hoped that the video rec@@ ord@@ ings contained evidence of how he died .
c@@ dc publish school aller@@ gy guidelines
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention ( c@@ dc ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food aller@@ gies of children in schools .
these are the first such directives issued by the us government , as the number of scho@@ ol@@ -@@ bound children with food aller@@ gies is increasing .
one in 20 children in the united states now have a food aller@@ gy .
according to the c@@ dc , the spread of food aller@@ gies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .
the guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food aller@@ gies among teachers and staff and how to treat children who have aller@@ gic re@@ actions .
it is also recommended that schools have ep@@ in@@ e@@ ph@@ r@@ in in stock – the ep@@ ip@@ en auto injec@@ tion is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fat@@ al hy@@ pers@@ en@@ si@@ tivity reaction .
the legisl@@ ators in the states have recently changed the rules to make schools more easily able to keep ep@@ in@@ e@@ ph@@ r@@ in in stock .
the report also contains a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms mentioned by children who have an aller@@ gic reaction .
children may say , “ it feels as if something is pus@@ hing on my ton@@ gue ” , “ my ton@@ gue feels like a hair on it ” or “ my ton@@ gue is cr@@ ink@@ ling ” .
parents of inter@@ sexual children can choose “ sex un@@ determined ”
germany is the first european nation to recognise a third gender for children born with un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gen@@ it@@ als .
new@@ born bab@@ ies are no longer allocated to men or women on a rigi@@ d basis .
under the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but can instead state ‘ un@@ determined ’ or ‘ not fixed ’ on the birth certificate .
the aim of the law is to reli@@ eve pressure from parents to avoid taking ha@@ sty decisions on sex allocation operations for new@@ born bab@@ ies and to combat discrimination against inter@@ sexual people .
an inter@@ sexual person , according to the bb@@ c years later , said , “ i am neither man nor woman . ”
i remain ma@@ im@@ ed and sc@@ ars of the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors .
it is estimated that one in 2@@ ,000 children each year is born neither as bo@@ ys nor as girls .
they are among the inter@@ sexual groups that fall under the diagno@@ sis of “ sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order ” ( ds@@ d ) , a term used to collect people with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es ( ger@@ ms ) .
wall@@ is simp@@ son was possibly inter@@ sexual .
understanding gender identification is still not well developed , but most experts in the us recommend using the best available gender allocation information if a provision is not made at all , and not waiting for a physical condition , if it is not possible .
new york psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in the problem of gender identification , said the new german law “ bl@@ ade after a good thing ” .
inter@@ sexual children are an ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
“ some people have life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening diseases that require sur@@ gery , but most children do not , ” he said .
you can assi@@ gn a gender without sur@@ gery and then wait for identity to develop .
the scientific data on how a child develops his / her gender identity is not very accurate .
no one knows why it is happening .
it is like the secret of why people are hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual .
a report to the european commission in 2011 states that inter@@ sexual persons are not typically trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender persons , but are not defined in terms of sex , but by their biological constitution , or by their status as non-@@ gender .
these characteristics were reflected in sub@@ ordin@@ ate sexual characteristics such as mus@@ cle mass , hair , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure , priority sexual characteristics such as re@@ productive org@@ ans and gen@@ ital structures or in ch@@ lor@@ ine .
the report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sexual and trans@@ gender people in professional life , as well as the extent of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and pre@@ jud@@ ice crime .
bo@@ ys who do not con@@ form to gender are now in a special camp .
in australia and ne@@ pal , it is now possible for adults to indicate male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .
in june , austr@@ ali@@ an nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ g@@ end@@ er-@@ free ” person after a court granted li@@ fel@@ ong “ un@@ defined ” gender status .
german identity cards will have a third as@@ sign@@ ment , x for inter@@ sexual , in addition to m and w in the future , according to the ministry of the interior .
in neighbouring france , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on france 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french members of the strictly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from tex@@ t@@ books .
the us ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic online website has also opposed the german law , saying , ‘ if the world is drag@@ ged into a new state , where the gender is a decision , but we do not turn sexual activity , then we will not .
the mother of a new@@ born child from mar@@ y@@ land explained to baby zone that she would find it better if bab@@ ies were assigned a gender at birth .
“ paren@@ tal existence is already stres@@ s@@ ful enough , even without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the gender of your child , ” she said to the parent website .
children need stability and security .
histor@@ ically , children born with male and female sex parts were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , according to the attractive greek god who had both sex@@ es .
ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to ext@@ ingu@@ ish and then re@@ build .
but now the ethical basis of an operation is in doubt , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how to make them grow up with the child .
“ in the mid-@@ 20th century , one called psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , ” said dres@@ cher .
if such a child was born , it was not the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t but the sur@@ ge@@ on .
the ruling theory on the treatment of children with un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal gen@@ it@@ als was based on dr. john money from joh@@ ns ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who believed that gender was form@@ able .
he co@@ ined the term “ gender identity , ” argu@@ ing that social and environmental imp@@ ul@@ ses – like parents educ@@ ate a child – inter@@ acted with a child ’ s gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es , whether they were male or female .
but his the@@ ories became controversial in a 196@@ 6 case , known as john / jo@@ an .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been separated from a bot@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to ca@@ str@@ ate the child completely and also remove his te@@ eth and then raise him as a girl .
“ money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation , but it was not , ” says dres@@ cher .
when the boy was about 15 , he swit@@ ched back to the male sex and married a woman .
with 38 but he committed su@@ ici@@ de .
according to dres@@ cher , there are still doctors who would practi@@ se this model .
but in the 1990 ’ s , with the internet coming in , survi@@ v@@ ors of these sex operations came to the public , “ un@@ happy with the outcome . ”
for example , j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 36 year old author from mon@@ tan@@ a , born with x@@ y-@@ male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als .
doctors were not clear about whether he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .
so his external or@@ gan and the ho@@ des were sur@@ g@@ ically removed shortly after the birth of 197@@ 6 , and he was raised as girls .
at the age of 12 he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es .
“ i knew i am not a girl , ” he told ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com about ab@@ c@@ news@@ .com , ”
i was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at the age of 18 he should receive a v@@ ag@@ inal plas@@ tics .
but , because he was de@@ pres@@ sive and knew that something was not right , he demanded his medical records .
what he found out was sho@@ cking .
i was ster@@ il@@ ised at my birth – and no one ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d , through which his body could not produce enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to develop the gen@@ it@@ als .
after experiencing the truth , he changed to the male identity , received te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one injec@@ tions and let his bre@@ asts be removed .
he became inf@@ er@@ tile by the operation .
today , he is fighting for others in an organization called interface project to make inter@@ sexual people per@@ ceived as normal .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , managing director of the california ad@@ voca@@ tes for informed choice , wor@@ ries that the german law may “ st@@ amp and sti@@ m@@ ulate . ”
“ many activi@@ sts are wor@@ ried that the german decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assi@@ gn the child ‘ not determined ’ , she explained .
we fear that this will encourage intervention .
we think it would be better to assi@@ gn the male or female sex and then wait .
we do not yet know what the impact of the law will be , so we can only spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that their organisation supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law , for “ it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender . ”
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .
the german law is about the allocation of the child to the child .
this is not a fight to force small children at this stage .
when you are grown up , you can decide your own body .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a pa@@ stor@@ al psycho@@ log@@ ist from pit@@ ts@@ burg , who has a daughter with a sexual differenti@@ ation dis@@ order and supports hundreds of others in a self-@@ help group , says german law .
k@@ ati@@ e , the daughter of bar@@ at@@ z , was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ logical resistance .
k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics due to the def@@ ect of the target cells for te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us and no ov@@ aries .
today , k@@ ati@@ e is 29 and married ; she works at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania as a child psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry employee .
although inf@@ er@@ tile , it hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or sur@@ ro@@ gate mother .
“ the law gives room to parents , which means that they do not have to make decisions hur@@ ri@@ ed@@ ly , ” bar@@ at@@ z said .
it gives you the time to make different tests and clarify things , giving you time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .
in this way everything is fine – you pul@@ l the child big and love it .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the paren@@ tal happ@@ iness .
and you don &apos;t have to make an operation in a hur@@ ry that can &apos;t be un@@ done .
“ this includes children in the decision and elimin@@ ates the fear that parents are causing because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .
ultimately , the child deci@@ des on the gender that su@@ its him better – and that is wonderful .
this will enable children to make their own decisions .
unknown girls are hur@@ t by car gun@@ s
unknown people have in@@ ju@@ red a twel@@ ve-@@ year-@@ old in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t in sho@@ ts from a car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators probably fi@@ red in gh@@ th@@ in on thursday evening with an air force on a group of children .
that was what the police in burg told us .
the girl was easily w@@ oun@@ ded on the left w@@ ade .
the girl was brought to hospital by rescue forces .
the shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators also went to a bus stop .
a dis@@ c bro@@ ke .
they then dro@@ ve .
the criminal police investig@@ ated , it was called on friday .
until now , the police inspection k@@ emp@@ ten has had a quiet hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the officials were only called twice to e@@ gg@@ -@@ ga@@ thering children , who thre@@ w them against fac@@ ades of the house .
since the owners of the house recognized this in time and removed the ice v@@ ent immediately , no material damage should have been caused .
the city was also the site of a number of new year &apos;s eve b@@ ö@@ ller , but no material damage was done here .
a local resid@@ ent in the bis@@ ch@@ of friend@@ ship trail reported that his car was wra@@ pped with a clo@@ ak and his wheel ar@@ ches were sto@@ len .
however , until the police arrived , the man found his wheel ar@@ ches in the immediate vicinity , which meant that the police had to stop taking action .
living with future prospects
actually , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries lives in a dream .
your house is located in a quiet residential area of stutt@@ gart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
the city is only a few minutes away by public transport .
&quot; i hope you don &apos;t fear sp@@ in@@ ning , &quot; as@@ ks wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries and points to a f@@ at spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new apartment for my hus@@ band and myself for some time .
but you know how difficult that is in stutt@@ gart .
the reason for this is not a spi@@ der pho@@ bia , but rather the concern to be unable to cope with the many steps of the house and the flat in the old age , she explains .
moreover , since a men@@ is@@ k@@ us operation , the mid 195@@ 0s have experienced for themselves what it means to move from floor to floor with handic@@ ap .
recently , she published a book on &apos; happ@@ ily living in old age - which form of living is the best for me ? &apos; .
&apos;@@ our apartment is the best example of what doesn &apos;t go at all in age &apos; , she begins to tell .
when she moved with her hus@@ band to the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .
today , with half fif@@ ty , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries thin@@ ks differently .
but it also knows that it is one of the few people who are ever concerned with the issue of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
most of them are dis@@ placing it as long as it goes .
always old are only the others &apos; , says she gr@@ ac@@ eful .
only when the pressure of the suffering is really great do you think about it .
&apos;@@ then it can be too late &apos; , ries said .
in her book , the interior architec@@ t presents 17 living models for a self-@@ determined living at age .
&quot; which type of accommodation you choose , however , is always an individual choice , &quot; she explains .
d i e solution does not exist for age .
even those who can afford reti@@ rement homes in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any should always consider getting si@@ ck .
and : &apos; without a good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also un@@ ite in the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; gives the expert book author the desire to res@@ et@@ tle .
among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often ci@@ ted pen@@ sion@@ er &apos;s w@@ g .
in old age , everyone has his tic@@ ks and m@@ ack@@ es .
&apos;@@ for me , such a community of residents would not be anything &apos; , says she with a win@@ k .
the hotel is located in the centre of the city , close to the main train station and the main shopping street .
&apos;@@ in old age you just need your re@@ treat rooms &apos; , ries .
the author does not wish to rule out the possibility of a senior resid@@ ent community still functioning .
but this must be different from the classic student w@@ g .
and sometimes you just want to rest , &apos; she believes .
with this opinion , it is not alone in the capital of the country .
&apos;@@ most of the old people in stutt@@ gart want to stay in their own flat as long as possible &apos; , is also the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital .
your office advis@@ es people on the topic of &apos; getting older &apos; .
therefore , it is precisely the elderly who would often accept in@@ convenience and restrictions , only to remain in their familiar surroundings , that is the experience of the ware@@ test foundation .
there are many ways to make the house or the apartment accessible today .
ries recomm@@ ends that anyone who deals with the ag@@ e-@@ oriented reconstruction of their home or home should first inform themselves thoroughly and not apply the first cra@@ ft@@ sman .
today there are also specialists for the conversion of old age .
even in the rental apartment , one or two things can be done , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architec@@ t will clarify .
but the existing apartment cannot always be adapted to the age and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .
this experience was made by wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries .
the room was very small and the bed was very small .
she will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for her@@ self and her hus@@ band .
before moving , it gra@@ ys her more than in front of the spi@@ der at her home door .
the us wants to continue prosecu@@ ting snow@@ den
the us has not changed its stance on former us intelligence officer ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of having passed on un@@ law@@ fully secret information .
as a result , he had to face a criminal case in the us , the spo@@ kes@@ man of the us state department , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , said in washington .
the latest snow@@ den statements would not change that either .
previously , german green politici@@ an h@@ ans christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , after a meeting with snow@@ den in moscow , had appe@@ aled to the us not to continue threat@@ ening him with pun@@ ishment .
p@@ sa@@ ki stressed that the str@@ ang@@ led statements were those of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , not of a german member of the government .
ed@@ ward snow@@ den is always ready to talk to german authorities .
first , however , he wants to clarify his situation .
the former n@@ sa employee , which the us has asked for , made this clear in a letter that was not addressed , published by the federal leader , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , on friday after a meeting with snow@@ bun@@ des@@ -@@ bun@@ des@@ sta@@ g .
the letter has the following wording , following a translation that has been circu@@ lated by str@@ ö@@ be@@ le :
to the competent authorities
i have been asked to write to you on your inquiry into mass surveillance .
i am a member of the ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den and was previously contrac@@ ted or employed as a technical expert at the national security agency ( n@@ sa ) , the central intelligence agency ( cia ) and the central intelligence agency ( cia ) .
as i worked in these institutions , i witn@@ essed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to act on a moral duty .
as a result of the publication of these concerns , i was exposed to a severe and persi@@ stent s@@ cour@@ ge that forced me to leave my family and home .
i am currently living in ex@@ ile and i am enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the russian federation under international law .
i am encouraged by the response to my political actions , both in the us and elsewhere .
citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the united states - have jud@@ ged the rev@@ el@@ ations to be a public service to a system of all-@@ en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing surveillance , which no one is accoun@@ table for .
these sp@@ y rev@@ el@@ ations brought many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the former co@@ ver@@ t abuse of public confidence .
the benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time the risks that are taken have been significantly reduced .
although the result of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as a breach of loy@@ alty and seeks to crimin@@ alise and bring charges to political expression .
nevertheless , to speak the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that the united states government , with the support of the international community , will put an end to this harmful position .
i hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , i will be able to participate in responsible clari@@ fication of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly in terms of truth and authentic@@ ity .

kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten has found a private buyer
&quot; the building is in good hands &quot; , says w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en &apos;s may@@ or michael ma@@ i@@ er .
the commun@@ e sold the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten in the garden road to a private person .
the sale was approved by the local council at its recent meeting in the non-@@ public part .
the building changed its owner at a &quot; reasonable &quot; price .
&quot; the community is satisfied &quot; , emphasi@@ ses ma@@ i@@ er .
the budget was set at eur 100 000 .
it is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
the may@@ or is right that w@@ inter@@ ling@@ en has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , like to heat the way to look on the garden .
&quot; this effort is now gone , &quot; ma@@ i@@ er is happy .

report : obama ’ s campaign considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton
president bar@@ ack obama ’ s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers have secre@@ tly con@@ tem@@ pla@@ ted replac@@ ing vice-president jo@@ e bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton in the 2012 election campaign , the new york times argu@@ ed .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ table surprise of mark hal@@ per@@ in ’ s long-@@ awa@@ ited work on the 2012 2012 campaign , “ double down : game change 2012 . ”
the times has a copy of the upcoming book , and she reported on thursday evening that the president ’ s top advis@@ ers had “ held extensive group meetings and po@@ lls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it had been done .
according to jon@@ a@@ than martin , the national political correspon@@ dent of the times , the book thoroughly records the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the white house , notably against the former vice white house chief of staff .
the potential change was a strictly guar@@ ded secret within the campaign infrastructure in chic@@ ago and the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of president clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers – including dal@@ ey , obama ’ s former campaign leader , j@@ im mess@@ ina , and the former white house chief advis@@ er , david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d , and david p@@ lo@@ ff@@ e .
“ double down ” claims that dal@@ ey had been at the fore@@ front of efforts to exchange bi@@ ds despite their “ close , personal relationship , ” before finally choosing such a move , the decision was made to “ improve ” the case .
in an interview with martin , dal@@ ey confirmed that the government had actually considered replac@@ ing bi@@ den with clin@@ ton .
“ i said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” dal@@ ey explained to the magazine .
it must be re@@ mem@@ bered that the president had terrible po@@ ll values at the time , so we thought , “ for god ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”
while dal@@ ey called the “ due d@@ ili@@ gence , ” martin told an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er of c@@ n@@ n that the campaign for re-@@ election had spent a great deal of effort on finding out whether such an election had been conducted .
“ campaigns don ’ t spend so much money on surve@@ ys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” martin said at ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
but it is not clear whether obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange .
martin told c@@ n@@ n that he asked d@@ al@@ ey if his bo@@ ss at the time had known about the potential change .
although dal@@ ey said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it was “ possible ” that obama knew about it .
martin added that “ double down ” did not provide a defini@@ tive answer to the question of whether obama ’ s political prob@@ ations had reached the desk .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin if he seriously thought obama had not known about the investigations into whether to drop bi@@ ds at the elections .
martin rep@@ lied , “ possible . ”
what happens on the way with my email ?
e-mail is actually called electronic letter .
was the letter secret techn@@ ically implemented in the design of the internet service , like in the conventional post ?
the main focus of the concep@@ tion of the early internet services was to make communication possible .
therefore , no attention has been paid to the basic technical proto@@ col@@ s establishing a stable foundation for a hear@@ ing-@@ proof exchange of letters .
therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
if user &quot; anna &quot; sen@@ ds an email to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; , are the computers of the two connected directly ?
the e-mail program or the anna browser sen@@ ds the mail to your service provider &apos;s mail server in the first step .
for example , if you have a g@@ mail account , that would be google .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that uses b@@ end@@ i .
on the track , the mail can be run via several other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni@@ e can then call the content at his provider .
are conventional em@@ ail@@ s read through the network ?
most ma@@ ils are read by software robo@@ ts on the way .
the sen@@ der &apos;s provider usually checks whether the mail carri@@ es a mal@@ icious program as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
a virus check is also carried out on the recei@@ ver systems .
also , providers check if it is a an@@ no@@ ying and un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail that is being deleted or sor@@ ted out into a sp@@ am folder .
do the robo@@ ts have another job ?
for systems like g@@ mail , the robo@@ t also determin@@ es the information google needs to place context advertis@@ ements .
when anna and ben@@ ni communicate via g@@ mail about their upcoming holiday trip , google can display appropriate links to holiday offers .
do not know people read the em@@ ail@@ s ?
the chan@@ ces of un@@ authorized people reading a mail are very low .
in theory , however , this is possible .
in companies administr@@ ators often have the option to read electronic mail .
the law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal opportunities to inter@@ cep@@ t or take note of em@@ ail@@ s .
there are also possible illegal sp@@ am campaigns .
is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils against reading ?
with an encry@@ ption according to the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be encry@@ p@@ ted effectively against reading .
it is also possible to hide the met@@ ad@@ ata of an e-mail communication with a high technical effort , so that it is not even easy to identify who communic@@ ated with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google on the email market in germany ?
according to a survey by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google play only a minor role in the mainly priv@@ ately used mail@@ boxes .
while y@@ a@@ ho@@ o-@@ mail ’ s shares were dro@@ pped recently , g@@ mail could increase significantly .
mother bur@@ ied in the forest and reti@@ red
when his mother died , wol@@ f@@ sburg ’ s man for@@ ged a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dead in a forest - and continued to pay their pension and care .
in order to be able to continue to receive pensions and care allow@@ ances , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg bur@@ ied his dead mother after police investigations into the forest .
first , he covered up the death of the 89 year-@@ ol@@ ds , and then he had paid in for the money for more than one and a half years .
now the 67 year-@@ old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on friday .
so the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was susp@@ ected in may : it was discovered then that no medicines were needed for the mother in need of care .
the pen@@ sion@@ ers told the investig@@ ators that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
because it seemed strange to officials , they continued to investigate .
it was discovered that the two had lived in a shared flat for more than 15 years and he had last looked after it .
the 67 year old finally ad@@ mitted the death of his mother .
according to the police , an ob@@ duc@@ tion did not give evidence of a capital crime .
want to see ice cre@@ am that lights up in the dark ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has developed the first ice in the dark – using tor@@ ren@@ ts .
char@@ lie franc@@ is took advantage of the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of marine organis@@ ms and created a g@@ low@@ ing delic@@ acy from them .
he came up with the idea after reading a research on qu@@ al@@ um and persu@@ ading chinese scientists to arti@@ fici@@ ally produce the sh@@ ining prote@@ in .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue , which increases the ph in the prote@@ in and tri@@ gg@@ ers the light .
chr@@ is explains that the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts to the war@@ m@@ th in the mouth and g@@ low – so the more you lic@@ k , the ligh@@ ter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the ice cre@@ am company “ lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious ” , says : “ the product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and you get two gram@@ s of it for 200 .
prote@@ in used in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ton@@ gue at a neutral ph value .
when the mouth war@@ ms up the prote@@ in , the ph value and the ice sh@@ ines .
we tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it to the market at hal@@ lo@@ ween because it had this wonderful lu@@ min@@ ous effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have ever made , because the tor@@ que illu@@ min@@ ator is four times more expensive than gold .
each ball costs me about 1@@ 40 p@@ ounds .
but for that it tas@@ tes delicious .
char@@ lie ’ s experim@@ ental company , based in bri@@ st@@ ol , is famous for its unusual tas@@ tes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold lea@@ f .
but his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .
he says , ‘ i would like to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am ’ .
this is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice cryst@@ als , which make ice cre@@ am , but i susp@@ ect we find a way to create it .
the ice cre@@ am uses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a qu@@ al@@ le arti@@ fici@@ ally produced by chinese scientists .
the ts@@ v mor@@ sum is still in the hand@@ ball association league after six mat@@ ches .
the team from ing@@ o e@@ h@@ lers will be the der@@ by against ts@@ v da@@ ver@@ den tomorrow , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .
with this game the season starts again for us .
&quot; i hope that we finally have our head cle@@ ared , &quot; e@@ h@@ ler &apos;s behavior is optim@@ istic .
he finally got his full cad@@ re , with the exception of the permanently w@@ oun@@ ded h@@ end@@ ri@@ k blo@@ h@@ me .
like us , da@@ ver@@ den also reli@@ es on temp@@ o game .
we must therefore keep our error rates low .
but first and foremost we need to increase the coverage , which has not made a clear impression at the last moment .
da@@ ver@@ dens co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z is far more relaxed after the first season victory against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the game was of course a house number .
but that is why we are far from the favorite , because everything can always happen in the der@@ by .
however , pan@@ it@@ z wants to re@@ locate in mor@@ sum to start a series .
missing is jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te jo@@ d@@ at .
the a-@@ you@@ th@@ ful jo@@ o@@ st wind@@ swe@@ ß , who is active with double playing rights at the a-@@ ju@@ g@@ end@@ lic@@ he h@@ c bre@@ men , is celebr@@ ating his season de@@ but .
if you are not hot in such a game , you should stay at home .
hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : in numbers
when i was small , hal@@ lo@@ ween had something magic .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat s@@ wee@@ ts , stay up late and d@@ ress up for the neighbourhood .
today i have become more like hal@@ lo@@ ween mu@@ ff@@ le .
in the last two years i have not agreed to distribute s@@ wee@@ ts from my home , and i do not think i will do so this year either .
but , according to statistics , i am a black she@@ ep in hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans – 15@@ 8 million to be precise – celebrate hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending $ 6.@@ 9 billion in conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery , cost@@ umes , and decor@@ ations ( the us sp@@ ends them ) .
one thing i look forward to every hal@@ lo@@ ween is the trend values .
the co@@ stu@@ me will account for about 1.@@ 2 billion of the usd 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , exciting un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited items are the last cr@@ y .
women no longer have to cover themselves in sex@@ y clothes , they can now also em@@ body temp@@ ting food such as piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ ger or car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies thanks to the walking dead , and i bet the da@@ f@@ t-@@ pun@@ k space ban@@ ners will make it into the inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the most sou@@ gh@@ t-@@ after cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i susp@@ ect that there is nothing wrong with tradition .
last year we covered our dogs and i was not alone in this , to my surprise .
indeed , americans spend $ 3@@ 30 million this year on cost@@ umes for their pe@@ ts , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
these are a lot of hot dogs .
we are not in@@ dul@@ g@@ ent in s@@ wee@@ ts .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
this amounts to approximately 2@@ 70 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate bars , lu@@ t@@ sch@@ er@@ n , bon@@ b@@ ons and gu@@ m@@ mi@@ b@@ ä@@ r@@ chen .
so good news for the us department of commerce , which has 41 million people pul@@ ling through the quarters with the phrase “ sweet or aci@@ dic . ”
indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of chocolate for hal@@ lo@@ ween and – let us not fo@@ ol ourselves – eat .
the only thing we do not want to con@@ sume is the su@@ gar@@ -@@ sweet c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; yet 15 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of it are sold around hal@@ lo@@ ween , the national association of conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ery producers .
that is about nine billion ma@@ ize bas@@ kets .
it is a myster@@ y that i have not yet been able to resolve .
nothing is more to hal@@ lo@@ ween than houses where it sp@@ u@@ zes .
they have great names like “ terror behind the walls ” ( which is , inci@@ dentally , in a real prison ) , “ ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am ” and “ the house of sho@@ ck . ”
there are actually 1,@@ 200 officially recognized sp@@ uk@@ h@@ ä@@ user in the united states that re@@ de@@ em $ 500 million , so america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you just get to k@@ in ’ s .
but let us finally get to the bis@@ cu@@ its .
char@@ lie brown tr@@ usted us with the big pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were children , and car@@ ving a shor@@ th@@ and lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating the christmas tree – something we made from small .
fortunately , the “ baby in the shor@@ tw@@ a@@ ve ” trend only began last year thanks to p@@ inte@@ rest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pum@@ p@@ k@@ in , not sitting in it .
this year , americans will spend about $ 10@@ 6 million in shor@@ ts , according to the us cen@@ sus bureau .
the shor@@ ter lan@@ ter@@ n , which is slowly ro@@ tting in the fore@@ ground , probably origin@@ ates from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , where 2@@ 45 million kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s were har@@ ves@@ ted this year .
if you want to score the right points , call ti@@ m and sus@@ an ma@@ th@@ is@@ don in nap@@ a , california and cut a little pretty from their 9@@ 21 kil@@ o@@ gram cu@@ b@@ ic .
housing fire in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ cht : rescue forces are bur@@ ying cor@@ k co@@ iled cor@@ p@@ ses
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade had to leave in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht on the late thursday evening .
a three-@@ family house in the district of hof cat@@ ches fire during the night .
the rescue forces are re@@ sting a co@@ iled cor@@ pse from the house .
the rescue forces found a co@@ iled cor@@ pse in a three-@@ family house during a fire in hel@@ mb@@ re@@ cht .
whether it was a resid@@ ent of bav@@ aria , as a spo@@ kes@@ man for the police in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th said , is not clear .
on the late thursday evening it bur@@ nt on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire bri@@ g@@ ade arrived , the fl@@ ames already hit a window .
the forces of intervention went into the apartment and found the cor@@ pse in a room .
the hotel was very clean and the staff were very helpful .
the whole ground floor was damaged .
all other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spo@@ kes@@ man continued .
the building was not in@@ hab@@ itable for the time being .
the exact cause of the fire was initially un@@ clear .
germany ’ s largest church of the country has launched an off@@ ensive to promote the pa@@ st@@ or ’ s profes@@ sion .
the background is a possible short@@ age of pa@@ st@@ ors : the prote@@ stant lu@@ ther@@ an church of han@@ nover exp@@ ects the number of its currently around 1,@@ 800 pa@@ st@@ ors to be hal@@ ved by the present situation .
for young people today , the profes@@ sion is very attractive and offers good prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in talks with the ev@@ angel@@ ical press service .
it is attractive to be able to determine the work and the daily rout@@ ine yourself .
the church of the state commission@@ ed a pa@@ st@@ or in full place to in@@ sp@@ ire young people to study the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study the@@ ology after the ab@@ it@@ ur .
bur@@ fi@@ a attribu@@ tes this to the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the profes@@ sion is characterised by great freedom and diversity .
i am the master of my calendar and i can focus on where i think it is important .
pa@@ st@@ ors could be very close to the people as a se@@ af@@ are@@ rs .
they earned as much as teachers and could live well from them .
certainly , more money is paid in the free economy , but the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans would have a safe employ@@ er for that .
this is what awa@@ its today &apos;s young people , who are not just concerned with career , but with a hard job .
according to the local church , which comprises three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , some 60 pa@@ st@@ ors are reti@@ ring each year .
at the same time , about 40 gradu@@ ates from a the@@ ology study begin their vi@@ k@@ ari@@ at .
in the future , jobs in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated periph@@ eral areas such as res@@ in , em@@ s@@ land or w@@ end@@ land may be difficult to fill .
bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organise study days for young people and to invite cele@@ bri@@ ties who have studied the@@ ology to attend .
the study of the@@ ology offers a wide range of training .
it can even become the president of the federal republic .
land ro@@ ver r@@ ally series announced
the interior features race seats and six@@ -@@ point bel@@ ts , as well as a hand@@ s-@@ free facility .
the options range from rein@@ forced bra@@ kes , a service package with support for bow@@ ler work mechan@@ ics and log@@ is@@ tical support to vehicle storage between events .
dre@@ w bow@@ ler , managing director of bow@@ ler motor@@ sport , states : “ the r@@ ally customers who arrive at bow@@ ler have changed . ”
they are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for ex@@ ci@@ tement and adventure and for a way to reach world-@@ class events .
we are pleased to open this way in partnership with land ro@@ ver and the m@@ sa and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different r@@ ally discipl@@ ines in britain and abroad , and to create new ones from reality .
we really enjoyed developing the def@@ en@@ der challenge car – that will be an enter@@ taining championship .
in addition , the def@@ en@@ der challenge has a training and test day in february , as well as the option to participate in deser@@ t rac@@ es in north africa and the middle east .
fire bri@@ g@@ ade to save a bit@@ ch , who was fir@@ ing 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous ro@@ cky pro@@ tru@@ sion in a quar@@ ry .
co@@ ck@@ spanish bit@@ ti@@ el@@ -@@ bit@@ din ru@@ by had run off after a minor road accident .
three days later , a stone quar@@ ry wal@@ ker discovered it in its poor location .
fire figh@@ ters ro@@ lled off on a rock face and saved the dog from safe death .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade succeeded in secur@@ ing a little bit@@ ch who sat on a 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e lead in a ro@@ cky wall .
the nine months old co@@ ck@@ er@@ sp@@ ani@@ el bit@@ ch ru@@ by had run away after a traffic accident on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before being saved from a quar@@ ry on wednesday .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , who own@@ s the dog came to the quar@@ ry fl@@ app@@ it in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire to take back to ru@@ by .
they had desper@@ ately sear@@ ched for their missing bit@@ ch and made calls for help available in social networks when they es@@ cap@@ ed the quar@@ ry after the small traffic accident .
around 14 : 15 on wednesday a wal@@ ker who carried out his dog saw the str@@ an@@ ded ru@@ by on the 15@@ -@@ meter high he@@ el in the quar@@ ry .
the technical rescue team of the cle@@ ck@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station rus@@ hed to the spot and ro@@ lled off for the rescue of rub@@ ys , which was then trans@@ ported up in a dog box .
and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .
it was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from the top and the ground .
she did not move mus@@ cle during her rescue – she was like a sti@@ ff .
but now it is doing well .
she then ea@@ ten a few ca@@ kes for dogs .
that was quite an unusual effort .
the fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .
peter la@@ u , the technical rescue team specialist , said : ‘ ru@@ by had a huge accident . ’
it was possible that she was very seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was taken to the veter@@ inary sur@@ ge@@ on , but he didn &apos;t notice anything except exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
bec@@ ky hall from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : “ watching the rescue was fri@@ ghten@@ ing . ”
i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t believe she was really up there .
it was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .
the veter@@ in@@ arian said that if exhaus@@ tion had become too large and had collap@@ sed , it would probably have cr@@ ash@@ ed .
the fire@@ men have done a great job .
what you did was really cour@@ ageous .
we are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .
scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son of ke@@ i@@ th@@ ley added : “ we were afraid that it would fall down , but it remained above . ”
the fire@@ men were great .
i can hardly believe where it was .
mic@@ k j@@ ag@@ ger explains that he never did k@@ ity per@@ ry when she was 18 .
during an interview with an austr@@ ali@@ an radio station this week , the pop star said that she was a background sing@@ er working on j@@ ag@@ gers ’ song “ old hab@@ its the hard ” from 2004 .
per@@ ry explained that she had dinner with the al@@ tro@@ ck@@ er , and that “ he dre@@ amed me when i was 18 . ”
she added : “ that has been a long time ago and he was very kind to me . ”
in a statement , a representative of j@@ ag@@ gers , 70 , said on thursday that he “ categ@@ or@@ ically denied that he had ever made any attempts at rap@@ pro@@ ch@@ ement with kat@@ y per@@ ry . ”
the representative added : “ perhaps she has conf@@ used him with someone else . ”

george ke@@ rev@@ an : european un@@ bun@@ d@@ ling gives the sco@@ ts the choice .
a new day , a new story of hor@@ ror about independence .
this time we are being war@@ ned that an independent scotland is necessary to join the schengen area as a condition for eu membership .
this is the keyword for stories about pass controls in ber@@ w@@ ick and a border secured with bar@@ bed wire along the h@@ adri@@ an wall .
indeed , the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de document referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of europe , but , as expected , this did not feature in the head@@ lines .
nor has anyone mentioned that eu member states often ti@@ e their str@@ ingent rules when it is cheaper for them .
as scotland is not part of the schengen area at the moment , continuing non-@@ compliance with brussels would be a small conc@@ ession in return for what one really wants from the sco@@ ts .
so , no story .
and one that has come so far in the years that it already res@@ emb@@ les a fo@@ ssi@@ l : for the first time i heard the “ independence means pass@@ port controls ” duc@@ k at least 40 years ago .
an interesting point is lost in the constant repe@@ ti@@ tion of this ancient history .
why should an independent scotland be expected to dance according to the european pi@@ pe ?
why exchange the london yo@@ ke against brussels , especially now ?
these are the real european news : the great post-@@ war plan for the unification of europe has st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , the european project has officially died .
across the eu , parties that are ho@@ sti@@ le to the eu or want to throw the euro on board as a single currency are gaining ground .
even in germany , the euro@@ ske@@ p@@ tic party could win germany ’ s alternative – founded only this year – just five million votes in the federal election in september – effectively pul@@ ling the free democrats ( the equivalent of the british democratic party ) out .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
but the current economic crisis is turning out to be a water@@ sh@@ ed .
because of the strict au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , in conjunction with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et to which the national economy is forced by the holding of the single currency , many people too far believe that the project was being pursued .
the euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – only in greece .
instead , the euro@@ system has ti@@ ed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to german ex@@ porters – and german politicians would like to leave that way .
without the possibility of de@@ valu@@ ation of the local currency , southern europe will find itself with an integrated productivity dis@@ advantage over germany .
the only way to achieve this is to cut wages and public spending – sp@@ ur@@ red by berlin .
behind the current et@@ at and monetary problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity problem .
as a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by brussels – a code to subsidi@@ ze french and german energy companies at the expense of consumers – european industry pays twice for electricity compared to the united states .
this is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we have seen in gr@@ ang@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all the world ’ s wage fix@@ ing does not protect the european petro@@ chemical industry from being squ@@ ee@@ zed into the corner by cheap american sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , a re@@ vol@@ t is rising , especially in france , the former eu che@@ er@@ leader .
after the war , france ’ s political elite saw the eu as a vehicle with which germany could be kept in check and paris lif@@ ted to washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a ga@@ te@@ way to political legitimacy , and has pus@@ hed europe into its own economic policy , which is what the strugg@@ ling french economy is strugg@@ ling with .
the result : marine le pen ’ s right-@@ wing anti-@@ eu front national has just won a decisive election , thereby putting the ruling socialists in third place .
the national front is now france ’ s most popular party with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the british labour party that it cannot assume that a lef@@ t-@@ wing split would automatically mean benefits .
what is le pen doing with its newly won popul@@ arity among the white french of the working class ?
it wants to use the eu elections next year to for@@ ge an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ community monetary blo@@ c in the european parliament .
if the anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections – and this is very much possible – then for the first time such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the european parliament .
this is the point i would like to make : in the not too dist@@ ant future , the growing res@@ ent@@ ment of the eu and the single currency will un@@ ite to abol@@ ish the euro .
the eu will not dis@@ appear , but it will become more like the “ europe of sovereign nations ” fav@@ oured by general de ga@@ ul@@ le .
germany and a few of its satellite economies may be holding fast to the euro , but france and southern europe will return to their own curren@@ cies .
i expect britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of fl@@ at@@ tering itself with the us .
but washington ’ s growing interest in the pacific region suggests that britain will be in the atlantic rain alone .
where is scotland in all this ?
we can decide to be a region of ( last resort ) small england .
or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling berlin and brussels what they can put in where they can .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could travel quite well in a loo@@ ser european union , provided we retain our own currency .
cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an un@@ federal europe of nations .
otherwise , we should consider doing the same for norway and maintaining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is – remark@@ ably – the most successful political movement against au@@ ster@@ ity in europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of proposed ( and succ@@ essive ) fiscal cuts .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous for scotland to op@@ t for independence now , only to be forced into au@@ ster@@ ity by berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : growing faster
a@@ fro@@ -@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries , as research shows .
physical changes do not mean immediate pub@@ er@@ ty .
there is no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are responsible .
experts believe that ep@@ ide@@ mic ob@@ es@@ ity is an early sp@@ ur to pub@@ er@@ ty .
the trend toward early pub@@ er@@ ty is less pron@@ oun@@ ced among young people .
former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist who speci@@ ali@@ zes in child health and family issues .
should a mother be concerned when her daughter gro@@ ws bre@@ asts and sh@@ am@@ bo@@ ys at the age of seven or eight ?
at the annual conference of the children ’ s association american academy of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , the pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ tto explained .
“ i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents – usually this is no sign that pub@@ er@@ ty is now fast , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious signs of development , such as growing bre@@ asts , sh@@ ame and ar@@ mp@@ it hair and body sm@@ ell , appear earlier on in girls .
however , there was only a s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first rule ble@@ eding occurs in the last 40 years ) .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , slightly less than 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
“ when bre@@ asts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years to get to men@@ ar@@ che , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , author of the book “ early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential handling of this advis@@ or .
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty progres@@ ses .
it is controversial what actually marks the beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is “ early enough ” when bre@@ ast aug@@ ment@@ ation is accompanied by a growth sp@@ ur@@ t of eight years ago .
in most cases , the process s@@ lows down or stag@@ na@@ tes – something a pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an can monitor closely .
if progress is made more quickly , tests may be shown by an en@@ dic@@ ron@@ o@@ log@@ ist to prevent serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are treatment methods for dela@@ ying early men@@ str@@ ual growth and preventing another consequence : pre@@ mature aging of bone , which can ultimately lead to growth in@@ hi@@ b@@ itors and therefore small body growth .
the recommendations for medic@@ inal or hor@@ mon@@ al therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the rate of growth and the emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are also important .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z is re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant about drugs , but he acknowled@@ ges : “ sup@@ pressing pub@@ er@@ ty can alle@@ vi@@ ate behavi@@ oral problems and girls ’ feel@@ ings , unlike their con@@ tempor@@ aries . ”
the other big problem is understand@@ able : parents simply do not want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters to have the period .
“ they are wor@@ ried about the risk of pregn@@ ancy or about how they handle the hygi@@ ene side , ” said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
“ it was a sho@@ ck , ” a woman re@@ members , whose daughter got her days with ten .
although there were initial signs and we had talked about men@@ stru@@ ation , it was emo@@ tionally un@@ prepared .
she came home with an@@ xi@@ ety and ex@@ ci@@ tement , because she was the first in her circle of friends .
there are many widely published the@@ ories about the causes of early pub@@ er@@ ty .
but there is no conclu@@ sive evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be ca@@ us@@ ative .
bo@@ ys enter pub@@ er@@ ty in a similar way to girls .
k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z believes that the most convinc@@ ing pre@@ mise is the ep@@ ide@@ mic of ob@@ es@@ ity .
he supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine who establish a link between body f@@ at and ad@@ mit@@ tance to pub@@ er@@ ty .
other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .
in that country , afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty rather than their white con@@ tempor@@ aries .
there are different explanations for this .
glob@@ ally , an early pub@@ er@@ ty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate and gen@@ es .
another myster@@ y : although bo@@ ys have seen their face and sh@@ ame hair grow earlier , the trend toward a full-@@ blo@@ wn earlier pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pron@@ oun@@ ced as girls .
other doctors at the a@@ ap conference emphasised the complexity of the issue .
the appearance of ac@@ ne and sh@@ am@@ ha@@ ar is common even with bab@@ ies and inf@@ ants .
“ we must be careful about how we identify the true beginning of pub@@ er@@ ty , ” said dr. law@@ rence sil@@ ver@@ man , a pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist at gor@@ ye@@ b chil@@ dr@@ ine .
parents should not hesitate to consult their pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an about how to talk to their child .
“ this can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” ri@@ et k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
if you stay calm , the child normally re@@ acts well .
girls who blo@@ om early need insurance , which is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than intended .
jum@@ bo manufacturers fight over seat width in the face of large orders
there has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats in the long-@@ hau@@ l air class , which is the sound of a bit@@ ter col@@ li@@ sion at the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show this month .
the dispute re@@ vol@@ ves around the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines are making the most effort , but this space , which is the most proven , is the key to efficient aircraft .
airbus demanded a industry standard this week , which requires a tourist board width of at least 46 cm ( 18 in@@ ches ) , but the us arch@@ ri@@ val bo@@ eing airlines says that .
the dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are compe@@ ting to sell even larger versions of their two-@@ engine long-@@ hau@@ l aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event from november 17@@ -@@ 21 .
how the re@@ ar part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are ran@@ ks of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic out@@ comes that the new “ mini-@@ jum@@ bo ” design is supposed to deliver .
bo@@ eing claims that its moder@@ ni@@ zed 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x , 4@@ 06 people in tourist class seats , which are more than 17 in@@ ches wide and allow ten per row .
airbus states that the compe@@ ting version of the a3@@ 50 carri@@ es 3@@ 50 people in 18 in@@ ch wid@@ ths in the tourist class , with nine per row .
aircraft gi@@ ants often share r@@ ough technical details through advertising in the specialist press .
now airbus is appe@@ aling directly to the public at the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x is expected to compete with more than 100 orders .
recently , the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war , showing don@@ ors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant , with the title : “ would they accept that ? ”
“ bo@@ eing proposes long-@@ hau@@ l flights in seats that are closer than regional tur@@ bo pro@@ ps , ” says airbus sales director john lea@@ h@@ y .
people become th@@ ick@@ er in the face of a change in eating hab@@ its , but aircraft seats have not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0s , when bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 defined the modern long distance journey , and by the end of the century , the weight of the male average american increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 .
the male average american wa@@ ist in the 21st century is 100@@ ,@@ 8 cm , according to us health statistics .
airbus says its ri@@ val is a se@@ ating concept from the 19@@ 50 ’ s , when the average body volume of the fres@@ h@@ ly b@@ ap@@ tiz@@ ed “ jet set ” was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
studies have been carried out , according to airbus , to prove that an additional in@@ ch ( 2.@@ 54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent .
bo@@ eing den@@ ies airbus ’ figures to the se@@ ating levels and says that it is not within the manufacturers &apos; discre@@ tion to decide how airlines will balance their fare and equipment .
the company also explains that research shows that the experience on the plane is more than the width of the seat .
“ it really is a matter of giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the cab@@ in expert k@@ ent cra@@ ver of bo@@ eing .
they do not want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them prof@@ itable .
you know your business better than anyone else .
for passengers , this is about more el@@ bo@@ w freedom , but for manufacturers it will increasingly be a subject that can affect sales .
behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the us or europe .
as re@@ u@@ ters reported for the first time in july , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat with their latest two-@@ engine long range designs as the market leader in this segment , the 3@@ 65 se@@ ated bo@@ eing 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ er .
bo@@ eing &apos;s findings are partly based on the fact that the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 7@@ 77 with its ten seats per row .
the increased cost per unit is still lower than the current ten se@@ ater machines .
“ bo@@ eing is therefore squ@@ ee@@ zing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston , head of passenger comfort at the european airbus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say that full ten seat cab@@ ins per row , with 7@@ 7@@ s in existence , indicate that many passengers choose closer arrangement , which could go hand in hand with cheaper fa@@ res .
“ eigh@@ teen &quot; surface seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that , from an economic point of view , the airbus offer is controlled by the threat posed by the 7@@ 77 expert , ” says mar@@ y .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not offer seats , but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .
the world ’ s travel@@ ers jet vend@@ ors even carry bel@@ t measure@@ ments to measure the equipment against the competition .
even if they are promoting comfort , all manufacturers also offer je@@ ts with a high den@@ sity design for low-@@ cost airlines and regional flights .
airbus has a ten@@ -@@ seat a3@@ 50 , but has not yet sold , according to its own statement .
until recently , airbus emphasised the importance of more adap@@ tability in cab@@ ins and offered wide cor@@ rid@@ ors for some je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern je@@ ts , experts say that the call for a new industry standard will probably dis@@ appear , but may di@@ str@@ act from the wave of 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking .
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that could spo@@ il the fun of smoking .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine was able to protect m@@ ice from nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for life .
before testing on human subjects , further tests are needed , which may take a few years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york said that the first results were good .
“ we are very hope@@ ful that this type of vacc@@ ination strategy can help once again millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop trying to test all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience their nic@@ ot@@ ine so much . ”
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus , which has been modified to contain genetic information on the production of nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects li@@ ver cells , which then produce a constant stream of anti@@ bodies .
anti@@ bodies hun@@ t the nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the blood and neutr@@ alize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smo@@ ker does not experience nic@@ ot@@ ine high .
vacc@@ inated m@@ ice , which was given to nic@@ ot@@ ine , maintained their normal level of activity in experim@@ ents .
m@@ ice without vacc@@ ination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said , a sign that nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached its brain .
the experim@@ ents are described in the journal science translation medicine .
earlier tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
vacc@@ inations had to be given so often to maintain anti@@ body levels that they were expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be much lower , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
as professor crystal said , a future vacc@@ ine for people , if safe , could be ad@@ min@@ istered to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a ci@@ gare@@ tte , and so on .
more likely , however , is that smo@@ kers would use it to stop .
“ you know : when you start smoking again , you will not feel a pleasure because of the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and this helps you to leave the hab@@ it , ” he explains .
british scientists said that the results were interesting , but also war@@ ned that further research was needed .
tri@@ po@@ di denied that he had been influenced by o@@ be@@ id .
an investigation is being launched against the former labour minister , jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di , from new south wal@@ es , by the state corruption control body .
the former n@@ s@@ w minister den@@ ies that he has changed the rules on maritime le@@ ase at the request of his political ment@@ or , ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , the co@@ ver@@ t participation in three land on state control .
the independent commission against corruption ( ic@@ ac ) has extended its investigations on friday , on the question of whether or not ob@@ ind has influenced various state ministers in relation to the absence of a cr@@ ash commission in august .
now , the acc@@ us@@ ation has been made that tri@@ po@@ di knew of o@@ be@@ id &apos;s hidden interest in the land after tri@@ po@@ d@@ is said to have ex@@ iled former depu@@ ty chief of staff ly@@ n@@ ne ash@@ -@@ ash@@ es .
in years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pus@@ hed for public tend@@ ers for the le@@ asing contracts .
the pe@@ d@@ ants were opposed to this and wanted longer mat@@ ur@@ ities .
in 2009 , the le@@ ase contracts for the companies at the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , which raised the o@@ be@@ ids $ 2.5 million ann@@ ually , were extended without public ten@@ der .
tri@@ po@@ di , who was the port minister from february 2006 to november 2009 , originally advoc@@ ated public tend@@ ers .
but he resi@@ sted making the changes at the request of o@@ be@@ id , who , as tri@@ po@@ di confirmed , ur@@ ged a re@@ organisation of the government ’ s le@@ asing arrangements .
one of the ic@@ ac &apos;s telephone records showed talks from august and september 2007 between o@@ be@@ id , tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior official who had changed to the port authority after he had worked under o@@ be@@ id .
“ was the issue discussed in these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions about the development of commercial le@@ asing arrangements ? ” , asked depu@@ ty commissioner an@@ th@@ ony whe@@ al@@ y tri@@ po@@ di .
“ no , ” rep@@ lied tri@@ po@@ di .
i cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .
definitely not between me and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es attack syria ’ s target , according to official sources
israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es att@@ acked a target in lat@@ ak@@ ia , syria , on thursday night , confirmed by a senior government official over fox news .
the official did not explain what the target was , but said that it was at least one .
according to associated press , the target was russian sa@@ -@@ 12@@ 5 missi@@ les .
at least twice this year , israel has already been bom@@ bing missi@@ le supplies in syria .
foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could be subjec@@ ted to “ ec@@ ht@@ sh@@ re@@ ste ”
the government is considering an extended “ authentic@@ ity test ” for foreign workers with 4@@ 57 vis@@ as .
if the test were to be introduced , it would be used by means of a criteri@@ on to prevent the 4@@ 57 from being used to fill un@@ qualified jobs or as a back door for the transfer of family and friends to australia .
today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former la@@ b me@@ p , max@@ ine m@@ c@@ ke@@ w , had condemned the government &apos;s comments on foreign workers because they could be taken as being victims by australia &apos;s neighb@@ ors .
“ l@@ oud statements like foreign@@ ers are to sit in the back , ” and , by “ adju@@ sting austr@@ ali@@ ans first , ” it is a very un@@ pleasant back@@ fall in times when trade unions called for a protected labor market india today , ” she said australia .
histor@@ ically , it said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to endorse this historic arti@@ fact , i would not be surprised .
the proposal for discussion out@@ lines twelve measures that were once thought up by the former immigration minister , chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was in s@@ ri lan@@ ka yesterday for talks on trafficking in human beings , has implemented five of the proposed changes , and others are still under consideration .
if the “ authentic@@ ity criteri@@ on ” is adopted , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is personally associated with the holder of the visa . ”
firms could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders , after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally dis@@ continued hundreds .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum man probably died from a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the christmas island .
the distur@@ bed son of the man who had come to australia with him is being served by an adult cou@@ sin@@ in who was also on the boat since his father &apos;s death on wednesday .
austr@@ ali@@ an authorities brought the man to the christmas island hospital where he died .
the british government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project for scotland .
h@@ s@@ 2 ltd is proposing to establish high-@@ speed connections between scotland and the north of england from phase 1 in 20@@ 26 .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said that the project “ will bring britain closer together ” .
the scot@@ tish transport minister , ke@@ ith brown , said he was very pleased to work with the british government on this plan .
phase 1 consists of a new high-@@ speed rail link between london and the west mid@@ lands .
after phase 2 has been completed , there will be links to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june , the government correc@@ ted the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed road between london and the north of england from g@@ b@@ p 3@@ 2.@@ 7 billion to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6 billion .
the british government , which is in talks with transport scotland , has instruc@@ ted h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for north england and scotland .
this includes the possibility of a journey of three hours or less from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : “ our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is a truly national network that brings britain and its cities closer together . ”
we are moving forward with h@@ s@@ 2 because it brings enormous benefits .
without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .
but it is also about the link between 18 british cities , including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh , which is being improved thanks to h@@ s@@ 2 .
scot@@ tish secretary of state ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael comm@@ ented : “ today ’ s announcement is good news for scotland . ”
on behalf of the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown car@@ michael called for scot@@ tish involvement in the h@@ s@@ 2 network to be “ un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal . ”
brown said : “ the high-@@ speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for scotland , but at the same time scotland ’ s economic power is also an argument for fast rail connections across the uk . ”
we are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the british government and to examine the options for a high-@@ speed rail link in scotland , which creates benefits for all and which already comple@@ ments the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh link , which is .
i look forward to exam@@ ining the report of inquiry with the british ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .
regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in australia for the time being .
austr@@ ali@@ an passengers must continue to sh@@ ut down tab@@ lets and smar@@ t@@ phones at the start and lan@@ ding , despite efforts in the us to relax the rules for such equipment .
the us federal aviation administration ( fa@@ a ) allows us airlines to change their rules so that passengers can read , watch , or play in , e-@@ books on their equipment during critical flight ph@@ ases .
during most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying that they are not allowed to read their e-@@ books when they start and land .
austr@@ ali@@ an companies are watching the decision to implement which us airlines will have to do a lot of work , but they are not looking at immediate plans to change their rules .
the aviation safety authority , casa , also said that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight ph@@ ases in australia still apply .
“ casa does not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on board aircraft , ” was said .
the subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions provided by cab@@ in crew .
vir@@ gin has already had discussions with the casa on extending the use of his wi-fi entertainment system on flights and has said that one is open to change , but that changes should be initiated by the legisl@@ ator .
“ we would welcome a casa review of the authorisation of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience , now that we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .
q@@ ant@@ as said that we will stick to the current rules for the time being .
“ our current directives provide that electronic equipment may not be used at star@@ t-@@ up and lan@@ ding , and we do not currently have any plans to change that ” , the company explained .
the fa@@ a rules apply to us airlines .
however , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the fa@@ a decision and the reasons behind it .
the decision will have different effects on us companies depending on the age of the fleet .
you must prove that your aircraft can toler@@ ate radio dis@@ ru@@ ption from mobile devices , and modify manu@@ als , training materials , hand bag@@ gage programmes and customer instruc@@ tion .
“ after an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use port@@ able , ligh@@ ter electronic devices like tab@@ lets , e-@@ book read@@ ers and smar@@ t@@ phones at all levels , ” said the airline .
in rare cases , when the crew is in a bad view , the passengers will be instruc@@ ted to switch off the equipment during the lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er equipment be sto@@ wed safe@@ ly under the seat or in the com@@ part@@ ments above the seats at the start and lan@@ ding stages .
before the s@@ lu@@ m@@ ber against sch@@ al@@ ke , co@@ ach b@@ v@@ b sup@@ porters with light missi@@ les had caused u@@ g@@ ly scenes in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena .
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced that he had severe consequences .
before the football league &apos;s friday match against the stutt@@ gart v@@ f@@ b , the ul@@ tr@@ as respon@@ ded with a silence - first of all .
the first album was released in the uk and was released in the uk in november 2007 .
the guests were mostly listening to their songs .
the southern grand@@ stand , on the other hand , where the loy@@ al and lou@@ dest b@@ v@@ b fans are , initially presented itself with an excep@@ tionally quiet appearance : no sing@@ ing , no calls for battle .
the post of cap@@ o , who otherwise coordin@@ ates the common fir@@ ing , remained un@@ filled .
and at the front of the gallery , a large flag was sing@@ ing with the title &quot; section sta@@ dium ban &quot; .
only as a go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er as always the first b@@ v@@ b player to enter the course , bur@@ ned a short-term ju@@ bil@@ ation .
when his team colleagues followed , there were vo@@ cal sing@@ ing and r@@ aging scar@@ ves - but not everywhere by a long time .
nothing was getting worse in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grand@@ stand .
the sta@@ dium speaker nor@@ bert dic@@ kel re@@ sum@@ ed the positive experiences of the last few days - der@@ by victory , victory over ar@@ sen@@ al , pro@@ long@@ ation of the contract by tra@@ iner j@@ ür@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not cause .
the first five minutes before the first fi@@ ff , the cap@@ o kno@@ c@@ ked his po@@ d@@ cast - and the stra@@ in that way had been almost pal@@ p@@ able with hands - s@@ oun@@ ded in a l@@ oud cr@@ y as a th@@ ick .
the last thing to do was the southern grand@@ stand - and finally the lou@@ dest place in the sta@@ dium was as usual .
and when the l@@ oud call &quot; der@@ by winner stands up &quot; came out of the south grand@@ stand at the latest when it came with an in@@ ch , everything was as usual .
the silence before was probably a response to what happened in recent days .
just before the f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the co-@@ travellers b@@ v@@ b tro@@ c@@ kets had been fi@@ red into the spec@@ t@@ ators and into the square - and almost do@@ g@@ ge@@ dly ro@@ c@@ ke@@ ters were shot .
the game was dela@@ yed due to the cha@@ otic scenes .
b@@ v@@ b-@@ bo@@ ss han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had received the top of the ul@@ tr@@ as village tun@@ e in his office - and if you think you &apos;re saying , this was an un@@ pleasant time for the fan@@ atic .
&quot; there will be massive cuts for the entire ul@@ tra-@@ movement , &quot; the b@@ v@@ b bo@@ ss announced on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , wat@@ z@@ ke prohibited the ul@@ tr@@ as from cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home game against the v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&apos;@@ i for@@ bi@@ dden that &apos; , he said .
we cannot give up on zero tolerance policy in the field of py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as have been shown various ways of pun@@ ishing - until tuesday they have time to choose one .
otherwise , wat@@ z@@ ke says , the b@@ v@@ b will impose a penalty by the end of next week .
&quot; this will be dr@@ astic , &quot; wat@@ z@@ ke insu@@ red .
we can be cur@@ ious to see how the re@@ actions in the south gallery will be .
deposit houses are bo@@ om@@ ing in sing@@ apor@@ e , as the middle class crisis has arrived .
in a p@@ f@@ and@@ haus in the shopping m@@ all ben@@ de@@ me@@ er in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a exchanges a golden arm re@@ if , a ring , and a few ear@@ r@@ ings to pay for their school fees .
“ my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house , my money is in it , ” says am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a .
although she earned 3@@ ,000 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars ( about 1,@@ 7@@ 30 euros ) as an administrative assi@@ stant and her hus@@ band also works each month , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .
indeed , demand in parts of sou@@ the@@ ast asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where it has ex@@ changed , became the third p@@ f@@ and@@ haus this week , which has been on the stock exchange .
ple@@ d@@ ging je@@ wel@@ ry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,@@ 300 sing@@ apor@@ e dollars in the case of jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a – but also almost as in@@ expensive as a safe lo@@ an .
typically , p@@ f@@ and@@ ers ’ houses in sing@@ apor@@ e require an effective 17 % annual rate , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 % that the united over@@ seas bank requires , a local len@@ der with a local len@@ der .
however , the advantage of the p@@ f@@ and@@ houses is that they do not require a veri@@ fication of cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess or income certific@@ ates , which is why loans are faster than banks can l@@ end .
that is why millions of people in the region are turning to p@@ f@@ and@@ houses , after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to lo@@ ose fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income ear@@ nings are looking for p@@ f@@ and@@ ers , so the economy is running out .
this week , the rating agency called standard &amp; poor &apos;s growing household debt , mainly through rising mort@@ g@@ ages , a risk factor for the cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess of asian banks .
mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand , and sing@@ apor@@ e es@@ timate that the agency would have the highest budget debt in asia relative to gross domestic product .
mal@@ ay@@ sia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of gdp , rising by 60 % in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also wor@@ ried about th@@ ai consumer debt , which has come out of a technical recession just this week .
on thursday , the data showed continued existing export weak@@ nesses and a fall in consumer demand .

historical pe@@ aks in gold prices over the past two years have rein@@ forced the trend to ple@@ dge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family je@@ wel@@ ry into cash .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 percent of the ple@@ d@@ ged objects are gold in the 200 p@@ f@@ and@@ houses of the city state .
people say , “ the gold price looks good , let us ple@@ dge grand@@ mo@@ thers ’ gold chain and bring it back next month . ”
the largest th@@ ai p@@ f@@ and@@ house operator , eas@@ y@@ money , has experienced a 20 % increase in customer numbers in its branches in recent months .
the growth in the deposit business is so strong that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , the operating authority of the b@@ end@@ em@@ e@@ er branch , and 15 more in sing@@ apor@@ e , not only wants to expand to neighbouring mal@@ ay@@ sia , too .
the company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million sing@@ apor@@ e dollars it received this week with the sing@@ apor@@ e stock exchange .
while some l@@ enders have been caught in the cros@@ s@@ fire because of high interest rates , ye@@ ah says that p@@ f@@ and@@ houses not only offer lower interest rates than other l@@ enders , but also did not directly increase the debt .
“ customers bor@@ row items they already own , and the li@@ que@@ fied personal valu@@ ables do not increase household debt , ” she explains .
the deposit lo@@ an business is increasingly accepted as a short-term , secure financing .

rescue package of $ 3@@ 25 million for tas@@ man@@ ian health care
the austr@@ ali@@ an government insi@@ sts on the tough conditions associated with the rescue package of $ 3@@ 25 million for tas@@ man@@ ian health care to ensure that the government cannot turn away .
federal health minister t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced that the comm@@ on@@ wealth will take “ immediate action ” to a@@ ver@@ t a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of disease in ch@@ ran@@ ks .
the funding for a four-@@ year period was decided after government consul@@ tations with the independent tas@@ man@@ ian member , andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
“ the government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said p@@ liber@@ se@@ k today .
the $ 3@@ 25 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency election aid .
further 26@@ 00 operations , including or@@ th@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c operations and treatments for gre@@ y star , are intended to eliminate resi@@ du@@ es .
there is also money for day clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better post-@@ hospital care , fac@@ har@@ ve@@ sting , mental health services , and the introduction of electronic health records systems .
“ these investments are in line with the ideas that affected clin@@ ic workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the tas@@ man@@ ian health system , ” said t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k .
the minister insi@@ sted on strict reporting and accountability by the tas@@ man@@ ian government .
the state must maintain the current level of funding in order to be able to receive money from the comm@@ on@@ wealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent .
a three-@@ member commission is being set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
as wil@@ ki@@ e said today , the $ 3@@ 25 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that will push the public t@@ ash@@ man@@ ic health system toward a more sustainable course . ”
nevertheless , he p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent assistance , which he expressed first to the prime minister at the beginning of may .
“ i am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” wil@@ ki@@ e said .
according to the state government , these election services will largely compens@@ ate for the recent cuts .
but the federal opposition ’ s heal@@ th-@@ policy spo@@ kes@@ man , peter du@@ tt@@ on , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pav@@ ement solution . ”
“ we are in today ’ s situation because the la@@ b government has pul@@ led out of the health system $ 4@@ 30 million , ” he said to ab@@ c tv .
it is not acceptable for a government to pul@@ l out almost half a billion dollars and put the comm@@ on@@ wealth into 300 million and then pre@@ tend that the good news is good .
du@@ tt@@ on called on p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not a single dollar of the b@@ ail@@ out would be spent on additional bureaucracy .
guil@@ lau@@ me nic@@ lou@@ x &apos; adaptation of the novel by den@@ is di@@ der@@ ot convinc@@ es with extraordinary production facilities and contemporary details , but it is also more severe food than necessary .
the act of the 17@@ 60 ’ s in france tells the story of su@@ z@@ anne , a young no@@ ble@@ man sent from her family to the monaster@@ y .
when she re@@ bel@@ led , she confron@@ ted the extreme cru@@ el@@ ty of an extremely s@@ ad@@ istic woman , becoming the object of ero@@ tic fas@@ c@@ ination with another .
the film never sli@@ des into li@@ be@@ re@@ dness or sen@@ sa@@ tion@@ alism – and that is his problem .
the sole@@ m@@ n seri@@ ousness with which the film is told makes it a qua@@ int bu@@ ll@@ dog for the public as well .
syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , according to a group of surveillance .
syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and g@@ it@@ f@@ gas@@ m@@ uni@@ tion manufacturing facilities , declared the global chemical weapons surveillance group on thursday , while there were serious col@@ li@@ sions in the north of the country near one of the major sites of tox@@ ic substances .
also on thursday , a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group announced that more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago .
the announcement of the organisation for the ban on chemical weapons ( op@@ c@@ w ) came the day before the date of the meeting on the matter .
1 november , which the h@@ ague organisation had set dam@@ as@@ c@@ us to destroy all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities or to make “ in@@ oper@@ able ” , including all machines for mix@@ ing tox@@ ic substances .
the conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all syria &apos;s chemical weapons by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
the destruction of facilities means that syria cannot produce new chemical weapons .
dam@@ as@@ c@@ us , however , must begin to destroy the weapons and supplies that exist .
it is estimated that there are around 1@@ ,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including sen@@ f@@ gas and ner@@ ve gas sar@@ in .
the announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the town of sa@@ fir@@ a on thursday , when experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , such as those located in the united kingdom .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group , which is tracking the number of deaths across a network of activi@@ sts in syria , declared on thursday that 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people died .
of these , 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
on the government side , 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 of them belong@@ ed to the army of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 are govern@@ ment@@ -@@ friendly figh@@ ters , and 18@@ 7 are leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah mil@@ i@@ ti@@ as .
the dead , too , are 2,@@ 20@@ 2 deser@@ ted army soldiers and 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on 25 july , the un estimated that the number of deaths in this conflict has been 10@@ 0,000 since march 2011 .
this number has not been updated .
the conflict has forced some two million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sad ’ s troops have been fighting the re@@ be@@ ls in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks , many of which have links to al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a groups .
the centre said that there were losses on both sides on thursday , but did not mention details .
the fighting under@@ lines the danger that the chemical weapons inspec@@ tors face , because their mission to liber@@ ate syria from its tox@@ ic ar@@ sen@@ al is a race against the time in the mid@@ st of a dead@@ ly civil war .
op@@ c@@ w , working closely with the united nations , said that the team “ now believes that it has seen and witn@@ essed all the major production and mix@@ ing / filling facilities referred to by syria . ”
that is why ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’ .
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
the inspec@@ tors said that two security concerns did not allow the visit of two institutions .
on thursday , the op@@ wc stated that the two sites were “ abandoned , according to sy@@ ri@@ an statements , and the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other named facilities which were in@@ sp@@ ected . ”
it was not immediately clear whether the sa@@ fir@@ a site was one of the two facilities that the op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors could not visit .
syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the op@@ wc executive committee next month .
“ i sal@@ ute the bra@@ very and courage that they all showed in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said the director general u@@ z@@ um@@ k@@ u , who published in the post of general u@@ z@@ um@@ k@@ u .
for three years now , the mostly sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls have been fighting as@@ sad ’ s government and security forces , which are members of the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tes , in this civil war , to sec@@ e@@ de shi@@ a islam .
with regard to further developments , the head of the monitoring group , ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man , said that there was a major explo@@ sion in an air defence facility in the lat@@ ak@@ ia province of syria on wednesday .
the cause of the explo@@ sion was not known , he explained .
an@@ ger over the ver@@ dic@@ t on bom@@ bers by bal@@ i
the 20@@ 2 people who died in the bom@@ b attack in bal@@ i in 2002 were re@@ acting in an@@ ger with the ver@@ dic@@ t for the last of the in@@ sti@@ g@@ ators who were tried to be found in court .
pa@@ te@@ k , who was on the run for almost ten years as one of the most sou@@ the@@ ast asian people , was sent@@ enced yesterday for his role in the construction of explo@@ si@@ ves for the bom@@ b attack on 20 years .
he could be released after 15 years with a penalty .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was found guil@@ ty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular ku@@ ta tourist area , where 20@@ 2 people died , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans .
a guil@@ ty ver@@ dic@@ t was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explo@@ sive attacks on churches in indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
the prosecu@@ tor had demanded a life sentence even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who is also called ‘ demo@@ li@@ tion man ’ for his reputation as a master bom@@ ber .
the decision has ar@@ ou@@ sed pain@@ ful mem@@ ories of june cor@@ te@@ en , a mother of per@@ th who lost her 39 year old twin s@@ ons jan@@ e and jen@@ ny in the p@@ ate@@ k and his co-@@ con@@ spir@@ acies .
fighting with te@@ ars , she said that pa@@ te@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
i really think he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
“ you should put him in front of a sho@@ oting command , ” cor@@ te@@ en said to a@@ ap .
i have to live every day with the fact that i will not get any more grand@@ children and i will never see my dau@@ gh@@ ters again .
the sar@@ i club was ra@@ zed on the ground when , on 12 october 2002 , shortly after 11 p.m. , a massive bom@@ b explo@@ ded in a small v@@ ent par@@ ked in front of the night@@ club .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber explo@@ ded a back@@ pack .
he fell into the com@@ a for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times while he was hun@@ g for a life support system .
hu@@ gh@@ es said that pa@@ te@@ k deser@@ ved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell y@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah – am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las , and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a – were responsible for .
in fact , this type should be given the death penalty before anyone else .
le@@ tting him live – no , there is no reason to let him die .
getting 20 years after he killed 20@@ 2 people and in@@ ju@@ red many hundreds is not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to be tried .
he es@@ cap@@ ed from arrest for nearly a decade , but was finally pic@@ ked up in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i city of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces sto@@ le former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief os@@ ama , just four months later .
during the negotiation , an f@@ bi agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that pa@@ te@@ k was in pakistan to meet b@@ in la@@ den with the aim of re@@ connecting south east asian terrorist groups .
“ he didn ’ t stand up , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
until recently , he has shown no rep@@ ent@@ ance at how much suffering he has inf@@ lic@@ ted on other people .
the ver@@ dic@@ t was given before the ten@@ -@@ year anniversary of the attack this year , which was held with comm@@ em@@ or@@ ative cere@@ mon@@ ies in bal@@ i and australia .
“ there will be many te@@ ars this year , ” said cor@@ te@@ en .
pa@@ te@@ k may appeal against his judgment .
fa@@ a : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not make mobile phone calls )
air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , listen to music and watch movies from the departure to lan@@ ding , but not to make phone calls with the new federal guidelines issued on thursday .
but passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .
how quickly they would be implemented depends on the airline concerned , fa@@ a staff member michael hu@@ er@@ ta explained at a press conference .
airlines must prove to the fa@@ a that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the staff training manu@@ als and the provisions for stor@@ ing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .
the fa@@ a stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of port@@ able electronic equipment in aircraft .
these airlines included del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue .
“ depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices , ” said fa@@ a in a statement .
at present , passengers must sh@@ ut down smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets , and other devices when the doors are closed .
you may not re@@ start the aircraft until the aircraft reach@@ es a height of three kilometres and the captain has given the green light .
when entering the flight , passengers must switch off the aircraft again and not re@@ start them before the aircraft has lan@@ ded .
under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic distur@@ ban@@ ces could allow their passengers to use them even when they are launched , lan@@ ded and on the field of rolling , the fa@@ a explained .
most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to higher hei@@ ghts for the use of wi-fi should meet the criteria .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of the professional association of professional cab@@ in crew , welcomed the changes .
“ if the new scheme is implemented secu@@ rely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” comm@@ ented gl@@ ading .
we are frank@@ ly ti@@ red of feeling more atten@@ tive to this issue .
however , internet connections for surfing , ex@@ changing e-@@ ma@@ ils , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .
passengers are asked to enter the flight mode for smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices .
so still no &quot; words with friends &quot; , the sc@@ r@@ ab@@ ble res@@ em@@ bling online game that the actor ale@@ c bal@@ d@@ win 2011 played on his smar@@ t@@ phone , when he had to leave a public@@ -@@ sector airline je@@ w .
and more heavy equipment such as lap@@ top@@ s must continue to be sto@@ wed , as there is a risk of in@@ jury if you fly through the cab@@ in .
mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited .
the regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the federal communications commission ( f@@ cc ) , not the fa@@ a .
fa@@ a may lift the ban on certain electronic devices when they start and land .
last month , mark ro@@ sen@@ ker said of the national transport safety board transport safety authority that national transport experts on c@@ bs news were still considering mobile phones as a risk .
“ mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause distur@@ b@@ ance in navigation devices , but because we know from the f@@ cc that the transmission from the air can also dis@@ ru@@ pt trans@@ mit@@ ters ” , said .
a industry advisory committee , created by the fa@@ a to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow for a wider use of personal electronic equipment .
in recent years , the pressure on the fa@@ a has increased to ease use restrictions .
cri@@ tics such as the democratic sen@@ ator , cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ c@@ ill of mis@@ sour@@ i , believe that there are no valid reasons for the ban .
the restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to en@@ force , because the use of the equipment has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies talk of the fact that up to one third of passengers are for@@ getting or ign@@ oring the switch off of the equipment .
fa@@ a began restric@@ ting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 196@@ 6 , after reports of dis@@ rup@@ tions to navigation and communications equipment by passenger uc@@ w radi@@ os , which had become the latest in technology , presented by passengers .
new aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the fa@@ a in such a way that electronic inter@@ ference is not a thing of the past .
airlines have been offering wi-fi for a number of years now , when the flight is reached .
the plan@@ es adapted to wi-fi systems are also more in@@ sensitive to inter@@ ference .
the vast majority of passenger aircraft should be designed to be more used by electronic equipment under the new directives , said hu@@ er@@ ta .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally give far less radio radiation than previous generations .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , only display minimal radiation when turned over .
however , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .
amaz@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ . is one of the ad@@ voca@@ tes of eas@@ ing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers .
in 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger plane full of kin@@ dle e-@@ reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find out .
members of the fa@@ a advisory committee expressed mixed feel@@ ings about the risk of using equipment .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d of the national association of airline passenger said that he believed that the dis@@ ru@@ ption of the equipment was genuine , even if the risk was minimal .
other members of the committee said that there are only a few isolated reports from pil@@ ots that advoc@@ ate dis@@ rup@@ ting aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .
the committee , however , recommended that the fa@@ a allow pil@@ ots to arrange for passengers to switch off the equipment in the event of an instrument lan@@ ding under poor vi@@ sibility .
a group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be equipped with a great deal of technology .
“ we are delighted that the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that a pleasant passenger experience does not conflict with safety , ” said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .
the birds saved by air rescue service from n@@ ord@@ see bo@@ re@@ hole .
a bird flo@@ wn to the coast by air rescue service , which had been found exhaus@@ ted on a north sea dr@@ illing island , was released into nature again .
the water r@@ all was flo@@ wn last month with a helicop@@ ter to ab@@ er@@ de@@ en , where it was p@@ oured into the allo@@ a rescue centre by the sp@@ ca animal welfare organisation .
col@@ in se@@ d@@ don , head of the center , said : “ this water r@@ all was probably a win@@ try dra@@ u@@ ght bird from northern europe , held back by the strong win@@ ds over the north sea . ”
it seems that the exhaus@@ ted bird was seeking refu@@ ge on the island of dr@@ illing .

when they were released , the water r@@ all was fit and healthy again .
is europe ’ s elite willing to do business with britain ?
business for britain was launched in april with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in britain want to change in our relations with the eu .
to this end , we commission@@ ed the largest and most comprehensive survey among british business leaders and asked them what they think about britain , the economy and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v inter@@ viewed more than 1@@ ,000 business leaders who dep@@ ic@@ t roughly the british company sizes , sectors , and regions .
the results of the survey will surprise many .
we have found out that the vast majority of companies are now ex@@ porting outside europe and are concentr@@ ating on countries that modern@@ ise and grow while the states in the eu are stag@@ n@@ ating .
they want government to fav@@ or new trade links with countries like china , india , and brazil , rather than bo@@ w to the long and demanding process of re@@ forming ob@@ sc@@ ure eu institutions .
when asked for their view on certain issues that are regulated by law – from anti@@ trust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ed to west@@ min@@ ster .
there was widespread dis@@ satisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the cost of the brussels rules would now out@@ wei@@ gh the advantages of being part of europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies have tradi@@ tionally agreed .
finally , and this probably says most , our consultation with economic leaders showed that a clear majority would like britain to move towards a change in the agreement , and a relationship with the eu based on trade , not policy .
this re@@ alization , which is found among companies of all sizes and leading groups , shows that the economy is pus@@ hing for a “ meaning@@ ful change ” that brings the business world back to britain .
it is a lot of the matter – a change in the agreement and better conditions for britain would lead to a 16 % change in opinion in favour of the eu ’ s remaining in a referendum .
the prime minister should be in no doubt : this po@@ ll shows that the british economy is behind his plan for re@@ negotiating the british conditions of eu membership .
it also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to britain from a re@@ negotiation .
a better deal for the british economy is possible and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone is now moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means that businesses are increasingly focusing on trade and a fundamental change in the brussels approach to regulations .
alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m calls the pipel@@ ine in bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .
the start of construction of the south stream pipel@@ ine in bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest european energy projects , declared the ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m board of directors .
“ today ’ s event is a mil@@ est@@ one : construction work has begun on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the largest and most important project in europe , ” said the ceo of ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m .
the project is a key element in the energy security of the whole of europe .
south stream is supposed to provide more diversity in russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contract dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and his counter@@ parts in ukraine , where most of russia &apos;s gas is stored for europe , is a concern for increased risk from conventional routes to hearing , as from official sources .
mill@@ er said that the direct link with bulgaria , a member of the european union , means that the geo@@ political risks associated with transit countries have been “ fore@@ ver ” elimin@@ ated .
bulg@@ arian consumers receive gas from south stream at dis@@ coun@@ ted rates when the whole 20@@ 15 project is operational .
according to ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m , construction work in other sub@@ ordin@@ ate countries is to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .
the pipel@@ ine is designed to provide an annual capacity of 6@@ 2.@@ 3 billion cu@@ b@@ ic metres of natural gas .

hearing before the royal commission : two y@@ m@@ ca employees accused of sexual off@@ ences against jon@@ a@@ than lord
two y@@ m@@ ca workers from new south wal@@ es ( n@@ s@@ w ) were accused of sexual off@@ ences involving children before the child care@@ r jon@@ a@@ than kö@@ ni@@ g lord was accused in 2011 .
but when the y@@ m@@ ca opened the commission , it stated that ‘ never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse in the organisation ’ .
chief executive phil@@ li@@ p h@@ are was ques@@ tioned about a case in which a y@@ m@@ ca employee was accused of mis@@ conduct in child por@@ no@@ graphy in 1991 , and another in which a sports teacher was convic@@ ted of the y@@ m@@ ca .
h@@ are said that ga@@ il fur@@ ness , a law@@ yer assi@@ sting the commission , knew about the first case but did not know the second .
he acknowledged that the y@@ m@@ ca ’ s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing that “ there have been external reviews of the y@@ m@@ ca , in which the y@@ m@@ ca was at the fore@@ front of child safety . ”
evidence to the commission shows , rather , that the y@@ m@@ ca was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the department of education and communities in august ( ministry of education ) .
h@@ are , who started with 21 at the y@@ m@@ ca , acknowledged that the management had “ down@@ ward from me ” failed to recru@@ it lord , and that staff were not sure that their obligations were being met .
lord was sent@@ enced earlier this year for sexual off@@ ences against twelve bo@@ ys during his two-@@ year career in the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was sent@@ enced to at least six years in prison .
however , h@@ are denied that the y@@ m@@ ca has a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting lor@@ ds ’ violations in relation to children ’ s safety .
the staff said they had observed infring@@ ements , including that lord was with children alone , she was priv@@ ately looked after as a baby sit@@ ter , she was sitting on his la@@ p , saying that he loved it .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , whose chief executive was lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was wor@@ ried about his behavior , said that the child service director jac@@ qu@@ i bar@@ ca was very concerned .
the managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have d@@ ared to re@@ im@@ bur@@ se their superi@@ ors .
instead , he said , their friend@@ ship with lord had affected their jud@@ g@@ ement , which is why they had not reported it .
h@@ are explained that he has informed the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w board of directors of his view that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ jon@@ a@@ than l@@ ord@@ -@@ incident ” to the report to the employee , “ did not .
h@@ are said that the decision to urge employees to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality obligations shortly after the charges have been made was taken by the y@@ m@@ ca ’ s chief child services , li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said that this was intended to prevent contam@@ ination of the evidence , but that was ‘ over-@@ ze@@ al@@ ous ’ and po@@ or@@ ly implemented .
the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was not a chil@@ d-@@ safe organization when jon@@ a@@ than lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained professor ste@@ ph@@ en sexual abuse commission from the gri@@ ff@@ ith university .

ton@@ y bla@@ ir said he would take the opportunity to return as british prime minister , but conce@@ des that a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview ton@@ ight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his reti@@ rement , the 59 year old announced his views on various domestic issues .
since his re@@ sign@@ ation in june 2007 , after a decade as head of state , bla@@ ir has largely avoided expressing his views on british politics , and has mostly con@@ fined his comments to foreign policy and his role as en@@ vo@@ y of the middle east .
on the question of whether he would like to return to the post of prime minister , bla@@ ir was quo@@ ted from the evening standard in london , saying , “ yes , sure , but it is unlikely that it will happen ... ”
when the hor@@ se@@ -@@ sho@@ oting experts arrived in car@@ di@@ ff to choose the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competition was im@@ minent .
but none of them was prepared for the three-@@ year-@@ old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
the k@@ n@@ ir@@ ps , who is not even in the kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and only took his first steps a few months ago , and his sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee ro@@ lled through the first three roun@@ ds and won the first prize .
the in@@ separ@@ able couple , both equal in size , were p@@ raised for their performance , behavior , and style at the annual competition organised by the sun@@ ny@@ bank equ@@ e@@ strian centre in ru@@ dry near car@@ di@@ ff .
in competition with men and women with elegant mel@@ ons , he had placed his leg@@ s cap in a ne@@ at angle and led the two years old to@@ ff@@ ee through the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was p@@ raised by the jur@@ ors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pon@@ y , which was well above his age .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received top marks for his performance and his person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on had received to@@ ff@@ ee last march as a gift to his third birth@@ day and since then practic@@ ed every day with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y .
his mother , don@@ na , 30 , said : “ f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great fe@@ at . ”
they had to compete against the entire field and went out of the field with gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with to@@ ff@@ ee and we were all delighted when he won .
completely ali@@ en in the arena thought it was so phenomen@@ al that they wanted to be photograph@@ ed with him .
the little boy from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o near eb@@ b@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , follows in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ well , who has been running horses for more than ten years .
ho@@ well ’ s story said : “ the entire audience was elec@@ tri@@ fied , and everyone fu@@ el@@ ed and killed it . ”
he ran on sand for the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .
f@@ ent@@ on is cra@@ zy for animals – he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has two ch@@ ick@@ ens to take care of .
as it started , it will not be long before it is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and i am sure it will be good .
one spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said , “ f@@ ent@@ on is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pon@@ y . ”
together they are a great team .
the jury evalu@@ ated f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee how well they had be@@ aten and presented in the performance .
they look for good cooperation between pon@@ y and leader – and here f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i am sure f@@ ent@@ on &apos;s sweet clothes played their part in making this a perfect occasion .
chinese newspapers are to be “ re@@ formed ” after calling
a chinese newspaper , which had called on the front page for the release of a re@@ porter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation , should be re@@ formed , a press regul@@ ator declared .
the new express , based in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , had printed a rare public call for the release of the journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but chen later ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fal@@ si@@ fy reports about a sub-@@ state company .
now the new express is being subjec@@ ted to “ comprehensive rec@@ ti@@ fication , ” the regul@@ ator declared .
the “ rec@@ ti@@ fication order ” was issued by the gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong press and publications authority , radio , film and television .
preliminary investigations showed that the new express , which belongs to the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group , had published several in@@ accurate reports about the publicly tr@@ aded company zo@@ om@@ ing between september 2012 and august 2013 .
“ the ed@@ it@@ orial management of the new express was dis@@ organised , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .
she said that she had decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u and to withdraw his re@@ porter ’ s license ” .
in addition , “ the y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group has been instruc@@ ted to complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of the new express and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the new express be identified and the new leadership team immediately re@@ viewed . ”
chen had written several articles for the new express in which he reported on alleg@@ ed financial ir@@ regul@@ arities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after he was arrested , the newspaper issued two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journ@@ alistic work .
but chen then appeared on state television and ad@@ mitted that he had published false reports for payment .
“ in this case , i have damaged zo@@ om@@ lion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel c@@ c@@ tv .
i did it first and foremost because i was out for money and gl@@ ory .
i have re@@ alised that i have acted wr@@ ong@@ ly .
following chen ’ s apo@@ logy , the new express issued an apo@@ logy on the front page , declar@@ ing that it failed to check the reports correctly .
several well-known susp@@ ects have recently made conf@@ essions on television .
experts say that conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely en@@ forced , despite a legislative amendment earlier this year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to acc@@ use themselves .
dro@@ gen@@ tunnel , with its own rail system between the us and mexico , is disco@@ vering .
one of the most sophisticated tun@@ nels for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling between the us and mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electrical rail operations , has now been discovered .
the us authorities described the 120 times 90 cen@@ time@@ ters of the tunnel as one of the most sophisticated pass@@ ages they would have ever found .
the tunnel , which runs in the z@@ ick@@ z@@ ack pattern over a length of just six football fields , connec@@ ts ware@@ houses near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico , and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
there are countless un@@ seem@@ ly ware@@ houses in the area , making it easier to hide tr@@ uc@@ ks containing drugs .
the tunnel was closed before drugs could be trans@@ ported un@@ recognized in it , the authorities declared .
eight and a half tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 14@@ 8 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine were secured in the discovery of the tunnel , according to the court &apos;s records .
three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged for poss@@ essing and selling mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine .
they are threatened with prison sent@@ ences between ten years and life if they are guil@@ ty .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers rely on an extensive underground network of dra@@ in@@ age channels .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th large pass@@ age that has been discovered in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels were discovered in october after the mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in central mexico , which poses the challenge of the drug car@@ te@@ ls to how to quickly bring their product to the consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a pass@@ age of almost 6@@ 40 meters long , with rail@@ s , which ran from a kitchen in a residential building in ti@@ ju@@ ana to two ware@@ houses in san di@@ e@@ go .

ve@@ gan@@ ism , according to le@@ x@@ ic@@ as , is subject to vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , but diff@@ ers in a very significant way from that .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans allow themselves to eat cre@@ am ca@@ kes , ice cre@@ am or a strong ed@@ am@@ er , these gour@@ me@@ ts are not on a ve@@ gan ’ s menu .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g , besides the aband@@ on@@ ment of meat and fish , the ve@@ gan is aband@@ oning all consumption of animal products - hon@@ ey is also being denied .
what remains , one may wonder , but on closer inspection , ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion is characterised by a considerable ing@@ en@@ u@@ ity .
&quot; bread spre@@ ads are very popular &quot; , explains ute hen@@ kel@@ mann , owner of the local reform house , which offers a variety of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also visits the shop at dom@@ gas@@ se .
for 13 years , the native new ze@@ al@@ and has lived in ve@@ gan , lam@@ per@@ the@@ im has ( almost ) found everything he needs for life . &quot; in 1997 i converted my di@@ et and became vege@@ tari@@ ans &quot; .
at the turn of the century the next step was taken and i became ve@@ gan .
&quot; the convic@@ tion came not only because of the di@@ et , but because of the choice of shoes , &quot; proc@@ tor , who pre@@ fers the leather of normal leather .
he realized that other everyday concerns do not include animal products .
ve@@ gan is first and foremost an ethical man .
&quot; i don &apos;t want animals to die for me , &quot; proc@@ tor explains the ve@@ gan &apos;s ma@@ xi@@ m , which covers all consumer behaviour .
instead of m@@ our@@ ning bur@@ gers , ag@@ it@@ ators or rubber bears , the ve@@ gan quickly discovered new products , and enthusiasm increased .
&quot; it &apos;s a double bonus , &quot; proc@@ tor today says , &quot; actually ve@@ gan is not a ren@@ un@@ ci@@ ation , it &apos;s an en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot; the as@@ sumption is that you can use the di@@ et conversion as a normal .
and it was these conditions that caused many attempts , even if well inten@@ tioned , to fail .
&quot; the ad@@ diction factor is a very important factor , which makes many people give up quickly , similar to smoking , &quot; proc@@ tor makes a comparison .
and applies : &quot; certain tas@@ tes are not to be fixed at the animal &quot; .
it is often the sp@@ ices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .
&quot; you can also create the same effect in other ways &quot; , the ve@@ g@@ ans make clear .
proc@@ tor also offers a bar@@ bec@@ ue with au@@ ber@@ gin@@ es , mus@@ h@@ rooms and a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages .
he looks for a balanced , varied di@@ et , in which it is also supposed to taste something delicious .
of course , one wants something between the te@@ eth , that is legitimate .
&quot; it should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , &quot; proc@@ tor said .
he has not suffered any damage to health , including eating dis@@ orders , another widespread as@@ sumption .
for me , the conversion had a positive aspect .
i do not take a foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and have an increased vit@@ am@@ in content .
there are high-@@ performance athle@@ tes who only feed themselves with ve@@ gan .
&quot; my blood values are excellent , i often check out , &quot; proc@@ tor tells .
many ve@@ gan@@ si@@ cs war@@ n against the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 .
&quot; since animals are fed instead of gr@@ ass@@ ing on the pa@@ st@@ ure , it is question@@ able whether the vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 is found in the meat that is bought in the ch@@ est .
ve@@ g@@ ans also have the option of taking the co@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explains .
proc@@ tor does not have to go far in food procurement .
after all , basic food@@ stuffs exist everywhere and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
everything i need is on site .
i only buy something special from time to time .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how &quot; ordinary &quot; finished products are known to be &quot; .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time@@ -@@ consum@@ ing than is generally assumed .
&quot; there is a lot to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small k@@ ne@@ es you can achieve good , if not better , results in part , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
mar@@ gar@@ ine instead of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and carbon ac@@ id instead of eg@@ g , with his ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ ke , proc@@ tor was able to mar@@ vel his paren@@ t@@ s-@@ in-@@ law .
family celebra@@ tions give the ve@@ gan a new sp@@ ice .
this is dynamic when you co@@ ok together , and it is of a new significance .
&quot; the situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
of course , he was also s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ised .
do you not like my food any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - in sol@@ cher@@ le@@ i , one should be a ve@@ gan with a fing@@ er@@ tips .
&quot; i am not against people , i am part of this society , &quot; proc@@ tor does not want to be a grand@@ son .
and , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as ali@@ en to ve@@ gan as it would seem - and the ve@@ gan does not appear so restricted in everyday life as it usually would .
fast food is also allowed .
pom@@ mes are everywhere !
&quot; many shops offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even a vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia , he is different from pa@@ sta dishes , or just orders a piz@@ za without cheese , all a matter of hab@@ it .
the restaurants are so slow to get into it .
&quot; when i started eating ve@@ gan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , &quot; the new ze@@ al@@ and country can find a development : &quot; you have to talk to people , draw them to attention &quot; .
&quot; if enough demands are made , they may be inc@@ lined to add the menu , &quot; he hopes .
ve@@ gan@@ e restaurants are developing , such as man@@ n@@ heim &apos;s com@@ bus@@ tion plant or the bir@@ d@@ free café .
proc@@ tor wants other restaurants to have at least one ve@@ gan meal on the menu .
in fact , ve@@ gan dishes are available for everyone .
everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , and in the tru@@ est sense of the word , because they exclu@@ de others , &quot; proc@@ tor states .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way of making the vast majority impossible from the outset , &quot; proc@@ tor says .
however , buying ve@@ gan products may be a bit difficult at the beginning .
especially if one lear@@ ns to understand that animal addi@@ tives can also be included in pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts as colour@@ -@@ co@@ at@@ ers , one seems to be following eth@@ ics on so many hur@@ d@@ les and to leave the courage quickly .
not only for this reason , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book : &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives &quot; explains the many ingredients , the food and also the cleaning agents .
&quot; one is gradually developing a scan@@ ner view and knows what signs and lo@@ gos one has to watch out for &quot; it is sometimes better to do small steps than stand or st@@ um@@ ble , &quot; proc@@ tor knows .
ve@@ gan@@ ism , it is an important moral fing@@ er that h@@ its consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he does not quite manage to stop his hab@@ its , but at least he can te@@ ach consumers to question his hab@@ its cri@@ tically .

the british police have today sent a message of ex@@ tradition to wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who has sought refu@@ ge and sought asylum in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london .
scot@@ land yard explained that the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an had been given a “ call to stand up ” that would ask him to appear in a police station , and , if he did not , he would be liable .
ass@@ ange threat@@ ens ex@@ tradition to sweden for the charge of sexual off@@ ence , after its possibilities have been exhaus@@ ted under british law , since the supreme court rejected its objec@@ tion to ex@@ tradition at the beginning of the month .
fe@@ aring that stockholm would deliver him to the us , he sought refu@@ ge in the ecu@@ ad@@ ori@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y in london on 19 june and asked the south american country for political asylum .
scot@@ land yard “ sent a 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man a call to join a police station at a time we chose , ” a spo@@ kes@@ man explained .
he continues to viol@@ ate the conditions of his release on ba@@ il .
the message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .

tax on foreign property owners against london ’ s spec@@ u@@ lative bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury provi@@ sion@@ ally has co@@ sted the c@@ g@@ t measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of chancell@@ or george os@@ borne , who in the 2012 budget has a st@@ amp tax on the amount of the housing .
already , the income from the st@@ amp tax on residential property in the districts of west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea , which in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year fell to 7@@ 08 million p@@ ounds in northern ireland ,
co@@ ok said : “ after the rise in the tax on high prices and the introduction of the associated legislation against a tax , it is difficult to claim that high quality properties are exc@@ es@@ sively tax@@ ed , regardless of the public tax effects . ”
“ but this step could make some foreign investors more re@@ stra@@ ined in buying property in london , or dis@@ su@@ ade owners from selling it , ” he added .
the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in london ’ s weal@@ thy sou@@ th@@ west bel@@ t , which stret@@ ches from ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , was down by 1.@@ 8 % in the previous year .
central london has a stead@@ y annual growth of 5.@@ 6 % , but has been over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed by an emerging “ domestic ” market , in which the sou@@ th@@ west part of the city , the north , is 6.@@ 5 % .
scientists have been able to sh@@ ed more light on the context in which a dog &apos;s tail is associated with its mo@@ od .
earlier research showed that happy dogs were moving more to the right with the tail ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in ner@@ vous dogs it was the left side .
but scientists now say that other dogs can per@@ cei@@ ve and respond to these sub@@ tle differences .
professor geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st at the university of tren@@ to , said : “ people know well that the left and right brain half react differently to stimul@@ i , which produce positive or negative emo@@ tions .
here we tried to look at this for other species .
he also noticed that in dogs , just like in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the left side movement and vice vers@@ a , and that the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res played different roles in emo@@ tions .
to learn more about how dogs react to the side of their fellow dogs , the researchers wat@@ ched the animals while the other dogs looked at the films .
they measured the heart rate of the four-@@ leg@@ ged and analy@@ sed the behavior .
we will probably understand soon why the co@@ ck moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : “ we have shown the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to eliminate di@@ str@@ acting other aspects of the movement , and we could control it more .
when the animals saw a normally id@@ le dog moving the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the we@@ av@@ ing dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .
but if the inc@@ line of pregn@@ ancy was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog that wh@@ is@@ pe@@ red ) , their heart rate rose and they looked re@@ st@@ less .
professor v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a believes that the dogs do not communicate deliber@@ ately with each other through these movements .
he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience which movements they should worry about and when not .
he said , “ if you have different encoun@@ ters with other dogs and w@@ ound your co@@ ck in one direction rather with friendly behaviour and if the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis of that experience .
researchers say that the findings of dog owners , ve@@ ts and tra@@ in@@ ers could help to better understand the emo@@ tions of their animals .
john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , expert in dog behavior and guest schol@@ ar@@ ship at the fac@@ ul@@ ty of veter@@ inary medicine at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol , said that this was not the first study investig@@ ating links .
last year a team from l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n university found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggres@@ sive dog , and right to the right , when it is a satisfied dog .
in another research at victori@@ a university in canada , the following was stated : “ dogs are going to a robo@@ t dog if his tail wh@@ is@@ p@@ ers and not right – rather than being dis@@ rup@@ tive . ”
according to his statement , the differences could result from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpre@@ t the animals in the films or the robo@@ t dogs as dogs .
a study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .
“ although there is considerable evidence for many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two brain hal@@ ves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said d@@ w .
but since their behaviour is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .

po@@ pe franc@@ is ap@@ points the first car@@ din@@ al hall in february .
po@@ pe franc@@ is will be appointed for the first time on 22 february , new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church , as the v@@ ati@@ can announced on thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the highest cl@@ er@@ ics in the catho@@ lic church after the po@@ pe , and they are also the ones who el@@ ect a po@@ pe , so that franc@@ is will be the first group of men to vote .
there are currently 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , a car@@ din@@ al who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the po@@ pe ’ s election – that is true of a group of 120 “ eligible car@@ din@@ als ” .
in a statement in which the news was announced , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a va@@ tic@@ an spo@@ kes@@ man , said that a meeting of all car@@ din@@ als would take place before the cere@@ mony for the story was announced .
“ po@@ pe franc@@ is has decided to announce his decision to conven@@ e the congress in february in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of car@@ din@@ als from around the world can be planned , ” lo@@ bar@@ di said .
ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ic vo@@ ices j@@ ack val@@ ero said that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als is likely to have fallen by february .
he said that a po@@ pe normally appointed as many car@@ din@@ als as necessary to ensure that the number of eligible car@@ din@@ als was back at 120 , and that as many car@@ din@@ als over 80 as he would like .
the consistency of next year is significant because it is the first since the election of franc@@ is in march this year , val@@ ero says .
there is currently a certain over@@ han@@ g on the part of europe and , in particular , italy .
“ it will be interesting to see whether the new po@@ pe will ap@@ point car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world in order to restore the balance , ” he said .
for@@ ty per cent of ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics live in south america , but they have only a tiny number of car@@ din@@ al sal@@ aries .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the car@@ din@@ al council , founded by franc@@ is , to find a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from all over the world to reform the church .
in the past , the po@@ pe decided everything on its own .

the dist@@ ress of an obama voters
i have elected president obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .
he says that obama has made comm@@ end@@ able efforts that have been th@@ war@@ ted by republic@@ ans ’ bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics .
the bloc@@ king policy does not exc@@ use ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are ’ s website problems , the dr@@ one attacks
obama ’ s mem@@ o@@ irs to the 2008 campaign were a sad remin@@ der of what might have been possible .
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a student at the har@@ v@@ ard medical school in the second year of his studies .
i am reading a terri@@ bly sad book at the moment .
it is a book i thought would b@@ low me up during the sin@@ ister second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .
it is called “ the aud@@ acity to win ” and describes the mem@@ o@@ irs bar@@ ack obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .
when i finish my patients &apos; documents in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a bre@@ ath of words .
the election was a lands@@ li@@ de victory , and news spo@@ kes@@ men stopped to illu@@ str@@ ate the historical significance of this hour .
my class@@ mates we@@ pt with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was on their way to the white house and the nation was ready for change .
when obama took office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval rat@@ ings .
and then i close the book .
turning back to the present is a evil awa@@ k@@ ening , as if you are being tor@@ n out of a dream .
it is hard to remember these optim@@ istic times – they seem to be a v@@ ague memory , a sad remin@@ der of missed opportunities .
in fact , something has changed in the years since i first voted .
but it is simply not something i could have imag@@ ined .
i recognise the great and versa@@ tile things that obama has achieved , from the adoption of the affordable care act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from iraq , the end of the forced killing .
i agree that party political bloc@@ k@@ ade tac@@ tics have over@@ turned efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance , and closing down gu@@ an@@ to bay .
but , having def@@ ended the obama administration countless times to colleagues and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances , i have ended my attempts to explain .
i have reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an bloc@@ k@@ ade politics cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to inter@@ cep@@ t or kill inno@@ cent children by dr@@ ones over@@ seas .
it cannot explain why the national security agency collec@@ ts data on americans ’ private lives and why wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower is pun@@ ished , dis@@ closing government mis@@ conduct .
it cannot explain why an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , was mur@@ dered without trial , nor why the public limits on financing and spending were circum@@ ven@@ ted during the presidential elections .
it does not justify the results of a report that states that the efforts of the white house to calm the media are the “ most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on government . ”
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the in@@ ability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the affordable care act .
i do not know whether that is what i should have expected .
whether i should have understood , with 18 , that government could contradic@@ t the political campaigns it had prece@@ ded it .
obviously , the members ’ office is not a predic@@ table course , as an opposition party and ran@@ dom events like the new@@ town@@ -@@ mass@@ ac@@ re shape public debate .
but when i look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .
and that trou@@ b@@ les me most .
i re-@@ elected obama in 2012 , not because i was enthusi@@ astic about his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney was a conf@@ using and in@@ effective alternative , he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .
i had the impression that a second term for obama , free from the pres@@ sures of future elections , would deliver the hope that we have been hearing about for so long .
but , with obama ’ s approval rat@@ ings falling to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the har@@ der through this book .
it awa@@ k@@ ens in me the year@@ ning for the many promises that have been made in the air .
this week , i read a section in the book descri@@ bing how obama had to take a heavy loss against clin@@ ton in the pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania pre-@@ election .
in a meeting with the election workers after the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the cause of their cause .
“ i want us to find our magic again , ” he said .
we must remember who we are .
it is five years later , mr president , and i could not agree more .
the views expressed in this comment are those of na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest in paren@@ tal leave
bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e and me@@ p cli@@ ve pal@@ mer says that prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t is in conflict of interest in his paren@@ tal leave plans because his dau@@ gh@@ ters are becoming pregn@@ ant and could therefore benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ at , who is in a legal dispute about paying $ 6 million in carbon taxes , claimed when he wanted to wi@@ pe questions off the table as to whether he was in a conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could control up to four votes in the sen@@ ate , which are important for deci@@ ding whether to cut or cut co2 and mining taxes .
but pal@@ mer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and ab@@ bot@@ t ’ s dau@@ gh@@ ters would benefit personally from the laws .
“ he is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave , because when one of his dau@@ gh@@ ters becomes pregn@@ ant , he has a direct interest in whether he is on holiday or not , ” said pal@@ mer .
two months after the election , the pal@@ mer electoral commission officially declared the winner of the sun@@ shine coast seat of fair@@ fax by 53 votes ahead after the re@@ count .
pal@@ mer called for a review of the voting count process so that it could proceed more quickly .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s daughter fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?
“ we need a better system , ” he said .
why should we not have a system of mar@@ ching in , entering data into a computer , sel@@ ecting it immediately and then having the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?
pal@@ mer also cri@@ tici@@ zed the use of pen@@ cil marking when marking the bal@@ lot papers .
are they used because you can er@@ ase the results if you do not like them ?
today , voting with pen@@ cil is incredible .
the electoral commission has examined the options for an electronic vote and recently published a joint legislative proposal with new ze@@ al@@ and .
pal@@ mer , 59 , explained that his policies include an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast and that he will take his new post “ very seriously . ”
a public office is about serving the public .
“ we are not seeking re@@ ward other than history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .
r@@ bs suspended two fore@@ x trad@@ ers
the royal bank of scotland has suspended two trad@@ ers from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation , another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleg@@ ed currency man@@ ip@@ ulation is taking place .
some of the world ’ s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank , and r@@ bs , confirmed that they are co@@ operating with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , with us $ 5.@@ 3 tr@@ il@@ lion daily changing .
the two trad@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that en@@ tails the scand@@ al surrounding the li@@ bo inter@@ bank business .
the bank , which did not comment on the sus@@ pensions , confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities .
“ our investigations on this subject are continuing and we are co@@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and other regul@@ ators , ” said the bank two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation indicated that the r@@ bs had forwar@@ ded the records of em@@ ail@@ s and inst@@ ant messages sent by and to a former trad@@ er to the british regulatory authority , the financial conduct .
this trad@@ er , richard us@@ her , had left the r@@ bs in 2010 and is now expected to have been vac@@ ated by j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan from his current position as european head of fore@@ x spot trading .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of european spot trading at cit@@ i , was vac@@ ated this week and mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , form@@ erly chief currency deal@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ char@@ ts , was don@@ ated to standard .
none of these trad@@ ers was accused of any mis@@ conduct .
ban@@ kers belonging to the inst@@ ant mess@@ aging group of us@@ her bar@@ cla@@ ys and the ci@@ ti@@ group , said people close to the situation .
u@@ bs announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the swiss regulatory authority fin@@ ma declared that it was investig@@ ating alleg@@ ed man@@ ip@@ ulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities around the world – the european commission , fin@@ ma , the swiss competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the us department of justice , and the hong kong monetary authority – are currently dealing with acc@@ us@@ ations at ban@@ kers .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , told familiar people about the situation .
banks are comb@@ ing inst@@ ant messages and e-@@ ma@@ ils from several years in search of cases of mal@@ conduct .
the news about these investigations has put re@@ vol@@ ts on trad@@ ers in an area that has in recent years been one of the most prof@@ itable of the trading units of investment banks , but this year was constra@@ ined by vo@@ la@@ tility .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air and said that it is almost impossible to man@@ ip@@ ulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading trad@@ ers do not think that is necessarily true .
a leading trad@@ er noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms can lead to the “ existence of some ” banks .
the news came out the same day , when credit su@@ is@@ se announced that it had cancelled a trad@@ er of its london exchange tr@@ aded funds office this week , after causing a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .
the bank promp@@ tly informed the competent authorities and co@@ operates with them .
“ we are sure that the trad@@ er acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” credit su@@ is@@ se explained .
the building f@@ ence on the be@@ qu@@ ea@@ th@@ ed p@@ lot
a group of the citizens &apos; initiative &quot; sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese &quot; has beauti@@ fied the f@@ ence on the be@@ ch@@ t@@ le p@@ lot at the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b .
moreover , it clean@@ ed and broad@@ ened the foot@@ path , it says in a press release .
the planned covering of the cr@@ um@@ bling house at the re@@ ar of the property was not allowed for security reasons , because the site is threatened with sli@@ pping .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the p@@ lot , had denied the beauti@@ fication action with his colleague rein@@ hard dom@@ ke of the bi .
before the bi &apos;s action , a transparent message was put in place with the message &apos; we are for it &apos; .
but that did not distur@@ b the approximately 20 members of the citizens &apos; initiative much of their action .
their mo@@ tto on the grand pos@@ ter was &quot; we are against building ru@@ ins &quot; .
in doing so , she wanted to point out the danger of still greater ru@@ ins on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w - if the giant project one day fails .
in the discussion with many pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by before the building site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the re@@ alization of the city project will be better for many , although not many people have the same questions about the dimension of the bi presented project .
but they are beginning to resi@@ gn , because the city continues to delay these responses , it is said by the bi .
as has been said , the may@@ or &apos;s public statements have an impact .
may had said at the council meeting that he fe@@ ared that the thermal bath would end if the public decided to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the swiss me@@ ado@@ w .
some appear to be down@@ right fri@@ ghten@@ ed , others per@@ cei@@ ve them as a &quot; cru@@ de black@@ mail attempt &quot; on the population , as the bi press release continues to say .
the bi than@@ ked the don@@ ors for the color and all the help@@ ers .
sch@@ ir@@ is ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s shel@@ f : man@@ e no s@@ wal@@ ben@@ kö@@ ni@@ g
as satisfied as r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick is with the current high form of bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a table leader red bu@@ ll salzburg , the sports director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; was disappointed by the re@@ fe@@ re@@ es .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous tend@@ ency for man@@ e and al@@ an to be pus@@ hed into the category of s@@ wal@@ low k@@ ings , &quot; he took the two off@@ en@@ si@@ v@@ wir@@ bl@@ ers in protection at a press conference in salzburg on thursday .
the most recent reason for ran@@ gn@@ ick ’ s critique was yellow for man@@ e at 3 : 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , where the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese was given a supposed spectac@@ le to be fa@@ teful – but not as they did .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant mis@@ decision , &quot; ran@@ gn@@ ick said , &quot; re@@ fe@@ ree har@@ k@@ am called &quot; completely over@@ stret@@ ched &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am would also have contributed &quot; his part &quot; to the es@@ cal@@ ation between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g-@@ tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the match .
he def@@ ended his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot deci@@ sively : &quot; i would have beha@@ ved the same way in every single situation as mr sch@@ mid@@ t &quot; .
sch@@ mid@@ t himself wants no contact with his colleague after the sch@@ ar@@ m@@ ü@@ t@@ z@@ el with his h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter .
i do not know why .
&quot; i am the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old said .
but , given the course of success , ran@@ gn@@ ick agreed to a p@@ raise .
&quot; there are only two words : &quot; really good &quot; , he noted .
there is not much to say on the matter .
the way the team plays in particular is impressive .
that is just to continue .
there will be little change of cad@@ res during the winter transfer period .
there are no great reasons to change anything .
&quot; except for one player , ran@@ gn@@ ick explained .
supreme court re@@ affir@@ ms obama ’ s health bill
it is a great victory for the obama administration : the us supreme court today rul@@ ed that the health bill closely linked to bar@@ ack obama is constitutional .
by five to four votes , the jud@@ ges rul@@ ed that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act – forcing us citizens to sign a state ’ s health insurance or pay a penalty in accordance with the terms of the us constitution – by 20@@ 14 .
chief judge john ro@@ ber@@ ts sid@@ ed with the four more liberal members of the chamber , while jud@@ ges sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to and ken@@ ne@@ dy chose not to .
the court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 pages law , and also considered that the provision of the health act that states would either extend the access conditions for medic@@ aid , or otherwise would not extend all state funding .
the case against the law was initiated by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was deci@@ sively rejected by all leading republic@@ an presidential candidates , including the ultimate challeng@@ er mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney , in the 2012 pre-@@ election campaign .
norway : nor@@ we@@ gian town with giant mir@@ r@@ ors of light
with huge mir@@ r@@ ors , the inhabitants of a nor@@ we@@ gian village have brought light into their dark valley .
due to the low level of sun@@ shine , the r@@ ju@@ k@@ an in the ve@@ st@@ f@@ jor@@ d valley usually falls under the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .
with three giant refl@@ ec@@ tors at 45 meters in height , a space of the century became true on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &quot; , may@@ or ste@@ in@@ ar ber@@ g@@ s@@ land s@@ war@@ med at the start cere@@ mony in the channel t@@ v@@ 2 .
some tal@@ ented people got sun@@ chairs and others used sun@@ gl@@ asses for safety .
so far , sun@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y people have had to go to a nearby summit with a cable car in winter .
ten years ago , the local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal to bring the ra@@ ys with mir@@ r@@ ors to the valley .
this idea has ex@@ isted since 19@@ 13 in the town .
after several years of debate , the city council finally adopted the 5@@ 00@@ m k@@ ron@@ er ( about 6@@ 15@@ ,000 euros ) expensive project .
a similar construction has been providing the italian alpine village of vi@@ gan@@ ella with winter sun@@ shine for a few years .
post emp@@ t hardly any sunday
&quot; many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red do@@ ts for sunday blan@@ k are still on various let@@ ter@@ boxes of the core city and the city parts , but you can read the small print on yellow .
a request from the f@@ dp confirmed this .
on sun@@ days and public holidays , only in front of the post office building in ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and in the j@@ ak@@ o@@ b-@@ m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d .
whether the ho@@ f@@ heim and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten areas are emp@@ ti@@ ed on sunday will not be answered in the answer to the f@@ dp ’ s request .
the f@@ dp ’ s social and youth policy spo@@ kes@@ man , fr@@ it@@ z r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k , wants to make a move .
sunday emp@@ t@@ ying is an important postal service especially at termin@@ post .
&quot; this undertaking is being rad@@ ically and un@@ reasonable despite the price increase for letters on january 2013 . &quot;
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , chairman of the liberal group and municip@@ al council , supports his group colleagues : &apos; what an@@ no@@ ys me is the fact that the emp@@ t@@ ying times are being changed or even cancelled here by ste@@ al@@ th . &apos;
the post office is a miles away from the city .
&quot; at least the letter boxes in the neu@@ sch@@ lo@@ ß and ro@@ sen@@ gar@@ ten districts must be emp@@ ti@@ ed again on sun@@ days , &quot; says bit@@ t@@ ner and r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k un@@ is@@ on@@ o .
the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of nu@@ rem@@ berg was also the place where a mail@@ box with sunday blan@@ ket could be reached on foot , especially not mobile citizens .
ro@@ e@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k asked in the city council whether the city council is planning talks with the post office on this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er rep@@ lied that the post did not communicate with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
however , in ho@@ f@@ heim there was also a sunday emp@@ ir@@ ical event , as he knows .
your party has , of course , called for priva@@ tisation .
&quot; then decisions are taken elsewhere , &quot; said ma@@ i@@ er .
frankfurt parking fees are set to rise shar@@ p@@ ly .
parking in frankfurt could soon become more expensive .
the town ’ s mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate this morning will discuss a presentation by ste@@ fan maj@@ er ( green ) .
the parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent .
however , the time inter@@ val between parking c@@ loc@@ ks and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes , not increased prices .
in december , the assembly of the municip@@ al authorities will have to decide .
the re@@ tail@@ er committee of the frankfurt chamber of commerce considers that this is a &quot; bad idea &quot; .
the location was great , close to the main shopping area and the main shopping area .
the german transport commission considers that an increase after two decades is &quot; quite appropriate and in fact long over@@ due &quot; .
local public transport is also becoming more expensive .
the city of joy : rapid action is overwhel@@ ming host society .
with a narrow cad@@ re , the lor@@ ds i of the ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt had to compete against the t@@ g g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ingen of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b in the sch@@ ill@@ er schul@@ tur@@ n@@ hal@@ le in re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en .
the el@@ ders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team .
soon it became clear that they could not quite compete with the rapid action of the city of fre@@ u@@ den@@ -@@ k@@ ul@@ tur@@ ner , even in terms of age .
the g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ inger was extremely hard hit with the hard and placed sur@@ charges .
they repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played ne@@ at@@ ly over the main@@ s by sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z , and were not there for block defense .
two high first rate profits clearly expressed the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ st@@ ä@@ d@@ ter in all matters .
in view of this crus@@ hing and playing achievement , the third set was then slightly la@@ x and lu@@ st@@ less to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on november 2nd , the ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n tv , which was able to achieve a clear victory in n@@ ag@@ old , will be a much more powerful oppon@@ ent .
ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt i : dom@@ ini@@ k b@@ ü@@ er@@ le , y@@ an@@ nik b@@ ü@@ ch@@ le , se@@ bas@@ tian d@@ ö@@ l@@ ker , fe@@ li@@ x pal@@ la@@ den , ste@@ fan r@@ ä@@ ller , sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k .
in the b-@@ class , the second teams from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt compe@@ ted in the mur@@ g@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n .
they delivered a fi@@ er@@ ce@@ ly con@@ tested two-@@ hour match .
ner@@ v@@ ousness on both sides caused errors and points gi@@ fts , especially in the ball acceptance ; the precision on pass@@ ports was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes the over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous view prevented the chance .
in this very balanced meeting , the tv team from mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ u@@ tto voted through the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams .
day of care at the small eng@@ lan@@ der hu@@ t
the fifth day of care in the succ@@ ession of the natur@@ a 2000 project ob@@ er@@ ho@@ tz@@ en@@ wal@@ d was attended by a group of committed participants at the small eng@@ land@@ er@@ h@@ ü@@ tte in ib@@ ach .
due to stimul@@ i from the population , this day should be cut off in the area of the hu@@ t of view into the valley , said may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er .
many hi@@ kers , according to ka@@ is@@ er , named this area the spl@@ end@@ our of the ste@@ ep slo@@ pe , where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views .
he than@@ ked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature .
it offers every citizen the opportunity to set the acc@@ ents in nature .
at the same time , the tourist aspect can also be taken into account in ecological terms .
this ecological aspect was explained by fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it of the department of the protection of nature of the government bureau of fre@@ i@@ burg following the welcome by the district council of ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who took over .
the tourist destination of the we@@ it@@ b@@ lic@@ k , according to tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it , is compatible with the aim of preser@@ ving the old all@@ m@@ end@@ we@@ id@@ fel@@ d with its specific protected habit@@ at types by opening and connecting them to the existing .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies and gr@@ ass victims , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .
you need these free links to conservation .
tri@@ bu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to miss the chance to break a l@@ ance for the planned bio@@ sphere area .
the current measure is not only se@@ am@@ lessly integrated into this planning .
a bio@@ sphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous care .
after these various speeches , chief of the field , chri@@ stop@@ h we@@ h@@ le and life project manager cor@@ ne@@ lia bis@@ ch@@ off , divided the help@@ ers into groups .
the larger trees had already been be@@ aten in advance , and the fore@@ stry tra@@ w@@ ler could be called up .
a group of help@@ ers should take care of the un@@ loading of juni@@ per bus@@ hes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar .
the aim was to have a free view of the view@@ point .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed for nor@@ tel patents su@@ ed
the group , which own@@ s thousands of previous nor@@ tel patents , made an av@@ al@@ an@@ che of complaints on thursday about patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including google , the company that was over@@ taken by the in@@ solv@@ ency au@@ ction by him .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that nor@@ tel patents had bought for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed the sam@@ sung electronics co ltd , ht@@ c cor@@ p , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , and the u.s. patent court .
ro@@ ck@@ star is a joint venture of apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .
patents are concerned with technology that mat@@ ches search terms on the internet with relevant advertising , such as the compla@@ int that goes to the heart of google &apos;s search engine business .
representatives of sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star were not directly reach@@ able .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c are making mobile phones that work with google ’ s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which is in sharp competition with apple and microsoft ’ s mobile products .
in 2011 , google issued an initial bid of more than $ 9@@ 00 million for nor@@ tel patents .
google increased its offer several times and last offered us $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
after being out@@ bid to the ro@@ ck@@ star nor@@ tel patents , google motor@@ ola mobility acquired $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a business that was also motivated by motor@@ ola &apos;s library of patents .
“ although google failed in its attempt to purchase the patent in the au@@ ction , google has vio@@ lated the patents and continues to do so , ” says the compla@@ int .
ro@@ ck@@ star claims a high compensation for damages from google , as it claims that google &apos;s patent infringement is deliber@@ ate , according to the acc@@ us@@ ation .
egypt ’ s first freely elected president
mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si is han@@ ding over the o@@ ath of office , but his tri@@ um@@ ph day should not mean the end of political disputes in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ med mor@@ si promised a “ new egypt , ” when he was s@@ wor@@ n as the country ’ s first freely elected president , and thus the succ@@ ession of hus@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak took place 16 months earlier .
by taking office in the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si became the first freely elected islam@@ ist president of the arab world , and egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the mon@@ arch@@ y around 60 years ago .
he laid the o@@ ath before the 18 jud@@ ges of the court , dres@@ sed in black ro@@ bes , who is based on the n@@ ile and who is inspired by an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
“ we are stri@@ ving for a better future , a new egypt and a second republic , ” said mor@@ si during the sole@@ m@@ n cere@@ mony broad@@ cast live on state television .
“ today , the egyp@@ tian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , true democracy and stability , ” said the 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old mor@@ si , a fundament@@ ally trained engine@@ er and a member of the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood .
hundreds of soldiers and police guar@@ ded the building when mor@@ si arrived in a small car con@@ vo@@ y shortly after 11 o ’ clock in the town .
the first of the three was the first to be re@@ united by the new president , and the second was the mu@@ bar@@ ak president , who had the power to stop the city from the streets .
as the un@@ char@@ is@@ matic “ spare wheel ” of the bro@@ ther@@ hood mo@@ c@@ ked his personal presti@@ ge since his victory and a friday speech , in which he wanted to bring himself not only as a candidate of the islam@@ ists , but all .
“ egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the mor@@ si , dres@@ sed in a blue suit with a red ti@@ e , declared the jud@@ ges in the woo@@ d-@@ pan@@ elled chamber .
later mor@@ si dro@@ ve to ca@@ iro university where he was to make his in@@ aug@@ ural speech .
he was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national an@@ them , who he listened to in hab@@ ach@@ t@@ ste@@ ll@@ ung .
the military leader , fel@@ d@@ mar@@ sch@@ all hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i , was present .
on his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the university ’ s largest aud@@ it@@ ori@@ um with voice cho@@ irs from “ the army and the people are a hand . ”
the university of ca@@ iro , built in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education , became a strong@@ hold of islam@@ ist student groups in the 197@@ 0s .
mor@@ si , on friday , put a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on ta@@ hi@@ r square , the birth@@ place of the insur@@ g@@ ency that led to the end of mu@@ bar@@ ak ’ s author@@ itarian rule , and he vo@@ wed to re@@ sume .
but by putting the official e@@ gg@@ s before the court , rather than as usual before parliament , he is be@@ having in the hands of the military , which indicates that the power struggle will continue .
mor@@ si ’ s speech at ta@@ h@@ ir square was full of dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .
fal@@ ken@@ ber@@ ger dis@@ the@@ k is taking care of two great even@@ ings .
the new season at the fal@@ ken@@ ber@@ ger dis@@ co &quot; blue vel@@ ve@@ t &quot; has begun .
today friday evening we are called &quot; pum@@ p this party &quot; , tomorrow saturday evening we will continue with a ü 25 party .
the organis@@ ers of course promise f@@ at be@@ ats and cool sounds on both days .
workers cr@@ ash@@ ed by leaders : seriously w@@ oun@@ ded
when a def@@ ec@@ tive ou@@ ter sen@@ s@@ ator was replaced on thursday , a 5@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old work@@ er in eg@@ gel@@ s@@ berg fell from a leader and in@@ ju@@ red himself badly .
the lam@@ pre@@ ch@@ t@@ sha@@ us@@ en man wanted to change a def@@ ec@@ tive heating sensor at the outside fac@@ ade of an inn .
when he clim@@ bed to the lad@@ der , the man sli@@ pped down and cr@@ ash@@ ed on the concrete floor .
he suffered serious in@@ jur@@ ies and was brought to the land@@ es@@ k@@ ran@@ ken@@ haus salzburg with the rescue helicop@@ ter &quot; chri@@ stop@@ hor@@ us 6 &quot; .
rap@@ es in south africa : two li@@ fel@@ ong imprison@@ ment
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was sent@@ enced to two life@@ -@@ long terms on friday .
this was reported by the channel sab@@ c .
the victim was later killed as a result of serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana was found guil@@ ty at the beginning of the crime week .
the act had caused hor@@ ror nation@@ ally .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had rap@@ ed an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial estate in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p near cape town .
the doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours , but in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young people was so hor@@ ri@@ fying that the nur@@ ses and si@@ sters needed psycho@@ logical support .
k@@ ana ad@@ mitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with boo@@ y@@ ses on the tat@@ n@@ ach@@ t .
he also ad@@ mitted that he be@@ aten and rap@@ ed them , but denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
the police initially had a number of off@@ enders , but released two susp@@ ects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient .
the prosecu@@ tor also stressed during the trial that she was convinced that k@@ ana was alone at the time of the attack .
ra@@ pe is already almost a daily oc@@ curren@@ ce in south africa : approximately 64 000 reports of sexual violence are published ann@@ ually .
this is almost ten times the population of germany , but with 82 million people , it has a much larger population than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa es@@ timate the number of cases of sexual violence to be 10-@@ 25 times .
jum@@ bo visits sch@@ in@@ ken ’ s black forest .
jum@@ bo , searching for the &quot; best ham in the world &quot; : for the tv show &quot; galile@@ o &quot; visited the pro@@ 7-@@ star bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the speaker makes it clear right from the beginning : the most important thing for the ham is the por@@ k cu@@ ps , tur@@ bom@@ ast is not a good pre@@ requisite .
can ham that is given in every super@@ market be a quality product ?
ul@@ i , as head of the large sch@@ in@@ ken@@ fab@@ ri@@ k in the black forest , explains jum@@ bo the way in which the company &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; works in bon@@ n@@ dorf .
&quot; germany &apos;s favourite ham &quot; , as jum@@ bo announ@@ ces the black forest ham .
only with hair protection and kit@@ tel can he enter the factory .
jum@@ bo also has to dis@@ inf@@ ect his hands before he can reach the mic@@ ro .
jum@@ bo to strengthen at sn@@ ack b@@ ite in wal@@ d@@ sh@@ ut si@@ ghted
&quot; here i am being worked in a bar@@ ren amount , &quot; tv makers mar@@ vel at the sch@@ in@@ z@@ wal@@ d ham as a mass product .
16@@ ,000 cu@@ b@@ ic cu@@ ffs per week speak for themselves .
weight , f@@ at content , colour : ul@@ i explains what quality matters .
most pi@@ gs are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months .
television with a level ?
details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i &apos;m cur@@ ious if you measure ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co what happens then &quot; , says jum@@ bo cy@@ n@@ ical .
here the level of private television is presented in pure culture .
but watching it is worth watching anyway .
the spec@@ t@@ ator sees that the dis@@ ass@@ em@@ bling of the cu@@ d@@ dly remains manual .
because black forest ham is tradi@@ tionally found on the shel@@ f without b@@ ones .
the secret of ham is the sp@@ ice mix@@ ture with salt .
smo@@ ke tower and smo@@ ke fire remind jum@@ bo op@@ tically of a &quot; sub@@ marine &quot; .
the tr@@ ick : f@@ ir branches here in smo@@ ke provide the special taste of black forest ham .
20 days in the smo@@ ke make the ham finally almost black .
&quot; now the dis@@ c dis@@ appears in jum@@ bo , &quot; he announ@@ ces the test fe@@ eding .
&quot; the one who really is delicious &quot; , says the conclusion of the tv star .
that will enable all parties involved to live with it .
you thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seems to be resi@@ sting the trend .
the company has increased its profit prospects for the full year and exp@@ ects record revenues from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the uk .
the travel company now estimates that it will pay an adjusted pre-@@ tax annual profit of between $ 3@@ 25 and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared to $ 30@@ 5-@@ 3@@ 15 million in its earlier forec@@ ast .
if current targets are met , this will mean 12 to 17 % growth compared to the record $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million in 20@@ 1@@ 1-@@ 12 .
as managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner announced , flight centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and made a strong start in the second half of the year , especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and british private businesses .
“ since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been prof@@ itable , and some of them are well on the way to record annual revenues before interest and taxes , ” he said .
this includes australia and britain , which are typically among our strong@@ est ear@@ ners .
in australia , the leisure industry reco@@ vered in the second half of the year , which off@@ set a slightly weak@@ er market for business travel .
similarly , the leisure business of flight centre in the uk was doing a similar job , while business customers were spending less here too .
the us business reco@@ vered from the seas@@ onal weak@@ er first half , so a profit for the third con@@ secu@@ tive year is expected .
yesterday flight centre &apos;s shares rose by 3 c@@ ents to $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 .
schools are being encouraged to focus more on mathem@@ a@@ tics , sp@@ elling , and gram@@ mar .
in future , students will have to study at least one piece of sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are , a novel of the 19th century , romantic ly@@ ric@@ s and contemporary british nov@@ els from 19@@ 14 .
the ex@@ am also includes “ un@@ seen texts ” to encourage wider reading .
the combined course of english literature and language will be abol@@ ished .
from 20@@ 15 , students will have to take an independent g@@ c@@ se language test , with strong incentives to choose english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the ministry of education will publish tomorrow the new cur@@ ricul@@ um for english and mathem@@ a@@ tics – the first subjects that have been rad@@ ically re@@ designed .
other core issues will be changed next year .
in a separate initiative , of@@ qu@@ al , the audit authority , will announce a re@@ organisation of the g@@ c@@ se structures , including a new ben@@ ding system and less course work .
in a summer speech , education minister michael go@@ ve said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our testing system to restore public confidence , ” emphasi@@ zing that the g@@ c@@ ses would be more ambitious . ”
studies show that english schools spend less time on mathem@@ a@@ tics – 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries do .
australia &apos;s schools , on average , te@@ ach 14@@ 3 hours a year , and sing@@ apor@@ e students receive 13@@ 8 hours .
while there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathem@@ a@@ tics in the timetable , coalition cir@@ cles are likely to encourage comprehensive mat@@ h testing , combined with a greater ran@@ king of the subject .
the cur@@ ricul@@ um focuses more on “ problems from the right life ” , including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of talks
the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical discussion forum on monday 21 october in the new museum of the castle is about &quot; hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological considerations about how to deal with the last things today &quot; .
professor joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner is a tra@@ ine@@ e .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical forum of con@@ vers@@ ation is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and prote@@ stant church communities of sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the k@@ ul@@ tur@@ am@@ tes bo@@ den@@ see@@ kre@@ is .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to look into the forum of how people today classi@@ fy the &quot; last things &quot; after death .
if people had known too much of this over the past centuries , and put it on those images of heav@@ en and hel@@ l that have shaped our no@@ tions to this day , the contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic teach@@ ings are more likely to character@@ ize .
&quot; the greatest hope has been greatly ex@@ termin@@ ated by christi@@ ans in their critique of religion , &quot; says the speaker .
she &apos; supplied us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation marks &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner continues to say , &quot; but the crucial challenge remains the an@@ ger of death &quot; .
linked to this is the question of the long@@ ing for &apos; dream of everything being good in the end &apos; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in 196@@ 2 in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den , studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy at the al@@ ber@@ t-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g@@ s-@@ uni@@ ver@@ sit@@ ä@@ t fre@@ i@@ burg from 198@@ 2 to 1989 .
she received her doc@@ tor@@ ate in 1997 as dr. the@@ ol . , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
the hab@@ ilitation of fundament@@ al@@ the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ f@@ ä@@ lis@@ che wil@@ hel@@ ms university .
since 2010 joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has held a chair for systematic the@@ ology at the institute of catho@@ lic the@@ ology at the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from the kle@@ ine heu@@ berg confirm their faith in the company ’ s declaration of faith .
in two services , 10@@ 1 15@@ -@@ year-@@ old and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old you@@ ths of the se@@ af@@ aring unit were appointed on the kle@@ ine heu@@ berg .
the service was accompanied in the morning by the group lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si , the youth cho@@ ir the spirit .
by receiving the fir@@ m@@ sac@@ ram@@ ent , the young people said yes to their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the holy spirit .
the fir@@ m@@ l@@ ings had prepared for the great fe@@ ast in the last months , under the direction of di@@ ak@@ on rein@@ er stre@@ h@@ ner and with the help of numerous community members .
in various projects they met different tasks of christian community life and experienced the youth day in un@@ ter@@ mach@@ al together .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race enthusi@@ asts
in fine weather 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to complete the round trip across the hills around the lake .
ul@@ rich kno@@ bel , the organiz@@ ing sports club of ill@@ men@@ see , will be informed about this .
among the participants were many cy@@ cli@@ sts , especially on the short distance of 15 km and 300 meters of al@@ titude , who wanted to practi@@ se their ho@@ b@@ by once in a competitive atmosphere .
two top german junior drivers were also on the start in this competition : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z won the championship with the german national championship .
these two were able to move from the field as expected .
as in the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er could save a small advance into the finish line and def@@ ended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .
pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel was once again in second place .
the ladies were there@@ sa du@@ ell@@ i from the team night@@ m@@ are , who made it up to the top of the winning sta@@ ir@@ case .
anne ade@@ l from ill@@ men@@ see and leon@@ ie drivers from ow@@ ingen came in second and third place .
a pleas@@ ing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the municip@@ ality .
it was not only in terms of performance that the whole range of athle@@ tes was represented .
the age structure was also used by the oldest star@@ ters , from ten years of the youn@@ g@@ est to over 70 years .
in the main race this year , even more absolute top athle@@ tes were starting .
four drivers were able to resi@@ gn from the regional champi@@ ons .
among them phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a mountain bike semi-@@ pro from the black tus@@ k-@@ racing team .
pan@@ ger@@ l and a team member have already been world champi@@ on two times in the twel@@ ve-@@ hour race .
this year he became the european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who already own@@ s two german champi@@ ons in the du@@ ath@@ l@@ on , also played this role .
after 45 kilometres and 9@@ 00 metres of al@@ titude , a w@@ im@@ mer@@ sion hit final was reached in the finish run@@ ner in front of the three-@@ lakes hall .
pan@@ ger@@ l was the first to cross the finish line .
the rout@@ ine b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt secured second place in the overall rating only one second behind it .
at the same time her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann came to the finish as the third of the overall rating .
in the women &apos;s evaluation , christi@@ ane co@@ h@@ s@@ mann was the fas@@ test time in the main race .
the second place was secured by are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from bin@@ z@@ en@@ gen in front of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .
athle@@ tes and help@@ ers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organised process of the event .
travelling through mu@@ d , rivers , and jun@@ g@@ le for free medical care
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le brings free medical assistance to remote villages in camer@@ o@@ on .
b@@ wel@@ le and his team spend nearly every weekend tre@@ ating hundreds of patients .
there are not many doctors in west africa , only one for 5@@ ,000 people .
vote here or with your mobile device
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 of the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 ” .
you can vote for him or any of the other her@@ oes in the top 10 to vote for the “ c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year ” .
the winner will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue his exceptional work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le wat@@ ched his si@@ ck father lose consci@@ ousness and travel to hospit@@ als that did not have the means to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was in@@ ju@@ red in 198@@ 1 in a car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , the capital camer@@ o@@ on .
at first , he had only a broken arm , but then an infl@@ am@@ mation that spread to his brain and caused a hem@@ at@@ om there that was supposed to affect him for the rest of his life .
“ there were no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , ” says geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le .
we would have taken it out of camer@@ o@@ on had it been .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father in over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als to get the treatment they had to offer .
“ it is not easy ” , comments b@@ wel@@ le .
you can leave the house at five in the morning and race to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are a great many patients .
some people are even dying because they have to wait .
the situation has hardly changed since b@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father died in 2002 .
camer@@ o@@ on has only one doctor for every 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organization .
in contrast , the relationship in the united states is with a doctor for 4@@ 13 people .
but even if there were a doctor for them , most camer@@ o@@ ons could not afford to visit .
two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-@@ quarters of health spending in the country is private .
“ the only problem they have is poverty , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
and poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .
his father and so many of his comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ots suffered , and b@@ wel@@ le decided to do something about it .
last year , dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ er team carried out 700 free operations .
he became a doctor himself and worked as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on at the central hospital in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
he also established a non-@@ profit organization called as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , which trav@@ els to rural areas at week@@ ends and offers free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his volunte@@ er group have helped almost 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday he and up to 30 people co@@ ach and drive with the wra@@ pped medical equipment on the roof over un@@ pav@@ ed ter@@ rain to the villages that need help .
not always everything goes smo@@ o@@ thly .
more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d .
but when you arrive , you will be welcomed like her@@ oes : a f@@ es@@ tive meal , song and dance , and the best accommodation the place has to offer .
in these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and b@@ wave – with its wide sm@@ ile and limit@@ less energy – is happy to attend the che@@ er@@ ful celebr@@ ation .
the next morning the team will start exam@@ ining hundreds of patients .
“ we treat 500 people per journey ” , says b@@ wel@@ le .
you will come from a radi@@ us of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics offers medical care in a number of areas .
many people are treated for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , don@@ ated gl@@ asses , or free birth certific@@ ates – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .
in the evening , the team carri@@ es out simple operations with local an@@ aes@@ the@@ sia .
operations are usually conducted in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the procedure , the patients stand up and go to the recre@@ ation area to make room for the next .
the lighting for the op and dis@@ inf@@ ection equipment is fed by the gener@@ ator of the group , so b@@ wel@@ le and its volunte@@ ers work until the early hours of the morning on sunday .
it &apos;s a ti@@ ring pen@@ sum , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .
“ they dr@@ um@@ mer all night long to remain awa@@ ke and continue our work , ” says b@@ wel@@ le .
on sunday the team then goes back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of the work done .
the group – a mix@@ ture of camer@@ o@@ on doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps .
a man explained that the free operation of a broken line that he received now allows him to work again .
“ this is changing the future of my family , ” said the man .
besides the weekend clin@@ ics and his sur@@ ge@@ on in hospital b@@ wel@@ le also works at night in private clin@@ ics in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é .
with this second job he finances 60 % of his char@@ itable activities , according to b@@ wel@@ le ; the rest comes from private don@@ ations .
“ i really do not know when he sle@@ eps , ” says k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who studied at dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a medicine in the second year and works volun@@ tar@@ ily in b@@ wel@@ le ’ s group .
he is always either in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students like o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the us and europe support b@@ wave , this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .
“ we can be there in operations where we help to remove blood or keep the instruments for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , ” explains o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
this would never be possible in america as a medical student in the second year .
students usually pay for their trip to camer@@ o@@ on themselves and bring frequently don@@ ated san@@ itation material .
once you are in y@@ a@@ oun@@ d@@ é , b@@ wel@@ le will take care of the accommodation , the transport and the instructions .
“ he is undoubtedly a her@@ o , ” says o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
he dedic@@ ates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people knows no b@@ ounds .
the almost constant work is not a burden on b@@ wel@@ le .
helping others to live happ@@ i@@ er and thereby ful@@ filling a promise he made to his father gives him great pleasure .
“ i am so happy when i do this work , ” b@@ wel@@ le says .
and i remember my father .
i hope he sees what i am doing .
i do it to bring people back to lau@@ ghter and to reli@@ eve the pain .
visit the as@@ co@@ vi@@ me website and learn how to help .
excell@@ ently mas@@ tered the struggle
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s nov@@ elle &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is cut to the body of hor@@ st jan@@ son .
jan@@ son was a former ph@@ aser in the star trek : the next generation episode &quot; the same year &quot; .
the old man s@@ anti@@ ago cannot be fo@@ ol@@ ed by fishing .
so the two simply comple@@ ment each other excell@@ ently .
it is almost thought that the fol@@ ds can be seen in the nec@@ k of the old man , which the fisher@@ man &apos;s boy man@@ olo spe@@ aks of .
when s@@ anti@@ ago is ti@@ red of life sitting on the chair , jan@@ son is real .
the old fisher@@ man &apos;s role is also a character that jan@@ son excell@@ ently man@@ ages .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who does not give up and ultimately win@@ s the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his will .
jan@@ son was the only actor on stage in the long run .
he man@@ ages to focus the attention of the audience so that his mono@@ lo@@ gues are not bor@@ ing for a moment .
his efforts to finally pul@@ l the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the vie@@ wers forget that the sea consists only of blue lit water bott@@ les .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann will let the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .
during the performance he puts the scene into light : the hu@@ t of s@@ anti@@ ago , the bar of sing@@ er mari@@ e-@@ lu@@ ise gun@@ st , who with her songs and her magnificent voice bas@@ s deli@@ ght the soul .
the four musicians play cu@@ ban rhy@@ th@@ ms and are also guests of the bar .
tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
the city of cologne has a se@@ wage channel from the roman period , which is about 120 metres long .
if you visit cologne , you will not be passing the cathedral .
the two to@@ wers rise to the sky about 15@@ 7 metres and make it the second highest church building in europe .
but few visitors who adm@@ ire the two f@@ ili@@ gre@@ e church to@@ wers can imagine that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert in the field of cologne under@@ world .
meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of kö@@ l@@ n-@@ tour@@ is@@ m@@ us directly at the dom .
the tour starts quite un@@ spectacular : &quot; we start in the underground garage &quot; , says schul@@ ze .
in the se@@ ven@@ ties the city fa@@ thers wanted an auto@@ just city , and that is why the remains of the old city wall remained only those things that were not too big .
most users of the car park are therefore passing the roman remains and only leaving their cars .
but if you look closer , you will discover an archae@@ ological site separated by metal gri@@ ds in the d@@ 2 park dec@@ k .
the ru@@ ins of stone , which are about five metres high , are made of hand@@ -@@ pla@@ ted stones .
&quot; it is the remains of the roman city wall built in the second half of the first century after christ , &quot; says schul@@ ze .
before it comes back to light again , schul@@ ze gives participants at the upper level a look into a sin@@ ister , 15 meters deep sha@@ ft .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed either .
the next stop of the tour is the pre@@ tori@@ um , where participants des@@ cen@@ d again into the dep@@ ths .
we are witn@@ essing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the alps , the c@@ ca@@ a ’ s pri@@ est .
what c@@ ca@@ a means is to ask a visitor .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which means in german as &quot; city of roman right and city of the ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ ser &quot; .
and the pr@@ at@@ ori@@ um is the former palace of state , the centre of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the entrance to the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the roman se@@ wage channel , which is preserved here to about 120 meters in length .
&quot; you can go for a walk along the so called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a if you want , &quot; schul@@ ze invi@@ tes the guests .
schul@@ ze still has a surprise .
after getting the key at the ticket office , he takes the group to a 16@@ -@@ metr@@ e deep , wal@@ k@@ able sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the gr@@ ound@@ water , which was essential for rit@@ ual washing .
to this day , the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , whose origin@@ s date back to the eigh@@ th century , can be seen from different water levels through changing levels of the rh@@ ine .
mi@@ k@@ we will be part of an archae@@ ological area on the town hall square , for which construction will begin shortly .
but a few years will pass before the final stage is completed .
le@@ g almost h@@ acked : re@@ circulation of ro@@ ck@@ er process
a bloo@@ dy attack in the ro@@ ck@@ er mil@@ i@@ eu is re@@ ro@@ lled after more than four years .
a trial for attemp@@ ted death , dangerous bo@@ d@@ ily in@@ jury , and damage to property against two thir@@ ty years has begun in the district court of frankfurt ( oder ) .
it is accompanied by strict security measures .
the def@@ end@@ ants remained silent to the day of the act .
they were supposed to have been active in the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and at that time were among the band@@ ins .
the prosecu@@ tor acc@@ uses you of having , in june 2009 , s@@ oun@@ ded three men in a car , in conjunction with unknown accompl@@ ices in fin@@ ow@@ furt .
all victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , a man almost lost his le@@ g .
the victims are said to have been part of the compe@@ ting group of hel@@ ls ang@@ els .
one is said to have been a high-@@ level member from berlin .
it seems that this was prece@@ ded by a multi-@@ car persecu@@ tion hun@@ t .
the indic@@ tment was about a battle of the area and a demonstration of power .
the two accused had been acqu@@ it@@ ted in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .
a court spo@@ kes@@ man said at the time that it was not possible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the perpe@@ tr@@ ators had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and had not been recognized .
the federal court of justice suspended the ruling after re@@ viewing the prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office and re@@ submitted it to the court for re-@@ trial .
one of the def@@ end@@ ants is currently in open execution because of another off@@ ence .
the first step was to re@@ construc@@ t the processes at night .
the commissioner who was then appointed to testi@@ fy was invited .
the centre was on mobile phone calls from the def@@ end@@ ants and other people who had inter@@ cep@@ ted the police .
ro@@ ck@@ er is almost always in court , not in statements , following a law which they see as being .
this also applies to the victims .
in the first process , only one of the victims had un@@ packed .
prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office in frankfurt ( oder ) said at the request that new trac@@ es have appeared since the last procedure .
ele@@ ven more days of negotiation are scheduled for the process .
the dispos@@ s@@ essed society does not think
the night was long , the music was l@@ oud and the mo@@ od was good , but eventually it goes home .
the only thing is that hun@@ ger is notic@@ eable in the bel@@ ly of the people on the fron@@ t-@@ passenger and re@@ ar seats .
of course , some cock@@ tails or spar@@ k@@ ling wine may be responsible for this !
what is more , than ch@@ ill off to drive to the next dri@@ ve-@@ in to allow yourself a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit ?
i admit i am happy to be part of it when it comes to getting fa@@ st@@ food late night or early morning .
a few pom@@ mes , a col@@ a , a bur@@ ger - and then ni@@ x like back home and into bed !
but on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y dis@@ co go@@ ers are notic@@ eable .
because what is it that you have to miss to keep your fa@@ st@@ food bags out of the car window with constant regul@@ arity ?
the paper bags that have been thro@@ wn away are located on the streets and in the parking lots , especially at week@@ ends .
&apos;@@ why ? &apos; i wonder .
are people at do@@ of to take the bags home or the next refuse b@@ in ?
it is not just that the paper production is s@@ ca@@ ff@@ ol@@ ding the landscape .
bags have also covered up traffic facilities such as traffic control panels , causing accidents .
what does the &quot; dispos@@ able society &quot; think about , but not after , she probably does not even know what this word actually means .
if you travel more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you know what a re@@ ar seat can look like after a busy night : clothes , bott@@ les and other gar@@ b@@ age are to@@ w@@ ering .
there would be a few bags , more or less , that would not make up any of the bags - unlike the street , where no one wants to tr@@ ample on the lef@@ to@@ vers of other food .
i see the day when the cities and municip@@ alities are being blo@@ wn into the we@@ av@@ ing room - and the fa@@ st@@ food cha@@ ins have to ask for deposit for their bags .
obama ’ s backing down in health policy
yesterday , after intense criticism , president obama gave a re@@ treat to his of@@ t-@@ repeated , un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cal promise : “ if they like their health insurance , they can keep it . ”
after hundreds of thousands of their insu@@ rers received a letter of dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al , republic@@ ans in recent days accused the president of mis@@ leading the american public .
yesterday , obama rela@@ ti@@ fied his original promise .
“ the vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it , ” he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
in response to the numerous media reports on the dis@@ mis@@ s@@ al , obama called on the americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market .
most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or less than forec@@ ast .
“ you are getting a better offer , ” he said .
the government was un@@ surpris@@ ingly saying that the five percent of the population that had insurance themselves would have to look for a different tari@@ ff , because their contract does not meet the new standards according to the affordable care act .
“ i would like to say to these americans directly : they deserve better , ” said se@@ beli@@ us during a hearing before the house of representatives ’ energy and trade committee in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is responsible for implementing the affordable care act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ mis@@ er@@ able ” since october .
“ i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone else , ” she said .
i am determined to reg@@ ain your confidence .
the idea of an up@@ set se@@ beli@@ us being a consult@@ ant behind her at yesterday &apos;s hearing in the house of representatives was made to join the republic@@ an member bil@@ ly ob@@ ong from mis@@ sour@@ i after a dispute with her .
after more than three hours of hearing , long se@@ beli@@ us repeatedly pressed the question why the “ architec@@ t ” of the aff@@ or@@ able care act did not volun@@ tar@@ ily re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish a govern@@ ment@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance company .
government in jerusal@@ em does not confirm attack on sy@@ ri@@ an air base
an american government official who wanted to remain anonymous said on thursday to the american news station c@@ n@@ n that israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es had att@@ acked an air force base in the sy@@ ri@@ an la@@ b a day before .
the objective was &apos; missi@@ les and associated equipment &apos; , which the israeli government fe@@ ared were intended for leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , according to c@@ n@@ n .
sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as the arab al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya station , had previously reported that the base in the port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia was bl@@ amed on thursday the night of wednesday to thursday .
the israeli channel 2 television channel showed satellite images of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , where russian s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa defense missi@@ les can see a range of 70 kilometres , and a sa@@ -@@ 3 battery can be used for missi@@ les .
un@@ sure the government in jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , the news agency re@@ u@@ ters quo@@ tes an equally anonymous israeli government official , saying that he believes that israel has carried out the attack , but is not certain .
one spo@@ kes@@ man from the israeli ministry of defence said , in any case , &apos; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &apos; .
the journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i emphasised in the daily newspaper ye@@ di@@ oth a@@ hr@@ on@@ oth that the sy@@ ri@@ an regime has tried , sometimes successfully , to supply bo@@ den@@ -@@ air ro@@ c@@ kets to bo@@ den@@ -@@ he@@ ath .
the israeli government had repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to supply he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be accompanied by a &apos; red line &apos; followed by a military response .
john ker@@ ry says in an unprecedented admission that us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age has “ gone un@@ reason@@ ably far ”
john ker@@ ry , with an un@@ expected conf@@ ession , suggested a sof@@ ten@@ ing of the us def@@ ensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age was far too “ in@@ appropriate in certain cases . ”
the foreign minister also ad@@ mitted that he , together with bar@@ ack obama , was responsible for “ au@@ top@@ il@@ ot ” being publicly exposed when the explo@@ sive rev@@ el@@ ations of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower ’ s ed@@ ward n@@ bul@@ let .
the le@@ ak@@ ed information has pl@@ un@@ ged the us government into a diplomatic stor@@ m of indi@@ gn@@ ation on the part of its allies .
in a video con@@ vers@@ ation at the london open government conference , ker@@ ry said : “ the president and i and others in the government have learned of some things that ex@@ isted almost in the au@@ top@@ il@@ ot world war ii , of course .
he then became the first senior member of the us administration to admit that the us sp@@ ying cros@@ sed a border , but also stressed that no rights had been ab@@ used .
he said , ‘ in some cases , this has gone un@@ reason@@ ably far ’ .
the president is determined to clarify matters and is therefore conduc@@ ting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here .
i assure you that the rights of inno@@ cent people in this process will not be affected .
ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations .
he added : “ we are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to b@@ low themselves into the air . ”
there is a radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is ob@@ s@@ essed with killing people , b@@ low@@ ing into the air and att@@ acking governments .
so what if you were able to inter@@ cep@@ t and stop it before it happens ?
we have actually prevented aircraft cr@@ ash@@ es , buildings and people being mur@@ dered because we have seen plans of this kind be@@ fore@@ hand .
meanwhile , us legisl@@ ators will travel to europe to dis@@ pel concerns about america ’ s alleg@@ ed es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and convince europeans of the need to continue working with the us for the anti-@@ terrorism efforts on thursday , such as the us committee .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y from connec@@ tic@@ ut said that he had spoken to representatives of the european parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to ref@@ rain from participating in national security surveillance because of the fru@@ stration .
“ it is very important for us national security interests that europeans stay on board in the context of our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said mur@@ ph@@ y , who is a democr@@ at in the sen@@ ate for the first time as chairman of the foreign affairs committee .
i am also going to europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism , regardless of your an@@ ger with the n@@ sa programmes .
media reports that the n@@ sa has collected millions of telephone data in europe have stra@@ ined relations with some us allies , although the secret service leader this week said that the reports were mis@@ understood and based on na@@ zi al@@ li@@ ances .
other rev@@ el@@ ations quo@@ ted from snow@@ den documents that the n@@ sa had monitored the mobile phone from chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .
the leader of the national intelligence services , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age of allies as necessary , saying that this is common practice on both sides .
in all this , mur@@ ph@@ y said that his authority was preparing the congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and cham@@ bers .
the names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days .
he said that the exact route is still being worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y stressed that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”
he said that european governments should be honest with their people about the kind of sp@@ y programmes they have been using for years .
“ while we can change our surveillance programs to better protect europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones that sp@@ y , ” mur@@ ph@@ y says .
meanwhile , john ker@@ ry is on a weekend trip to the middle east and poland to address the res@@ ent@@ ment over the us strategy in syria , egypt , and iran , as well as the us surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an appe@@ als against prison in thailand
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old sy@@ d@@ ney woman , who was sent@@ enced to 15 days in prison in ph@@ uk@@ et for fal@@ sely claim@@ ing to have been rap@@ ed by a taxi driver , was released and ba@@ il was released .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was initially found guil@@ ty of a provin@@ cial court in ph@@ uk@@ et on june 15 , after saying that he had given the th@@ ai police a formal sentence on june 10 .
later , however , the pictures of a video camera showed that she had safe@@ ly entered her hotel after being separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an friend .
the police in ph@@ uk@@ et inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated b@@ am@@ ford for two days until they had conf@@ essed to have con@@ ceived the story .
she was in police cust@@ o@@ dy on the spot until the trial .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to 15 days &apos; imprison@@ ment in a low security prison on the edge of ph@@ uk@@ et , rather than in a prison for adult women .
she is the daughter of peter tun@@ ks , a former austr@@ ali@@ an rub@@ g@@ y-@@ league player who has been appe@@ aling to the ministry of foreign affairs in can@@ ber@@ ra for help with his daughter .
tun@@ ks told sy@@ d@@ ney on sunday te@@ leg@@ raph that the whole family was “ extremely concerned ” about his daughter ’ s welfare and wanted to have her back in australia .
“ we are naturally very concerned , but we hope that she will be back home as soon as possible , ” said tun@@ ks .
b@@ am@@ ford appe@@ aled against the ver@@ dic@@ t and is free to ba@@ ht a ba@@ ht deposit of 50@@ ,000 .
australia reports have reported that she is on holiday in the resort of kr@@ ab@@ i in southern thailand .
the court said that b@@ am@@ ford was represented by a local law@@ yer in ph@@ uk@@ et and that he had been war@@ ned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in prison .
but thailand may also seek to improve its un@@ distur@@ bed tourist image after the recent ass@@ ass@@ ination of the car@@ ni@@ val mic@@ hel@@ le sm@@ ith in ph@@ uk@@ et .
