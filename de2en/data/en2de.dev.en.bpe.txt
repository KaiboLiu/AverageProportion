gu@@ t@@ ach : increased safety for pede@@ stri@@ ans
they are not even 100 metres apart : on tuesday , the new b 33 pede@@ strian lights in dor@@ f@@ par@@ k@@ platz in gu@@ t@@ ach became operational - within view of the existing town hall traffic lights .
two sets of lights so close to one another : inten@@ tional or just a sil@@ ly error ?
yesterday , gu@@ t@@ ach@@ t &apos;s may@@ or gave a clear answer to this question .
&quot; at the time , the town hall traffic lights were installed because this was a school route , &quot; explained ec@@ ker@@ t yesterday .
the kl@@ user lights protect cy@@ cli@@ sts , as well as those travelling by bus and the residents of ber@@ g@@ le .
the system , which officially became operational yesterday , is of importance to the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se junction .
we have the museum , two churches , the spa gardens , the bus stop , a doctor &apos;s practice and a bank , not to mention the traffic from the &apos; gru@@ b &apos; residential area .
&quot; at times of high road and pede@@ strian traffic , an additional set of lights were required to ensure safety , &quot; said ec@@ ker@@ t .
this was also confirmed by peter ar@@ no@@ ld from the off@@ enburg district office .
&quot; according to current measure@@ ments , around 12@@ ,000 vehicles travel through the town of gu@@ t@@ ach on the b@@ 33 on a daily basis , of which heavy goods traffic accounts for around ten per cent , &quot; emphasised ar@@ no@@ ld .
therefore the construction of an additional set of lights was more than necessary : &quot; here safety comes first , it &apos;s that simple , &quot; said ar@@ no@@ ld .
a total of four road safety inspec@@ tions were carried out and a roun@@ d@@ about was also considered , however , this idea was rejected on account of the nar@@ ro@@ wn@@ ess of the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g / kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se jun@@ c@@ tions .
according to ar@@ no@@ ld , every possible test was carried out prior to the selection of the location for the traffic light posts : &quot; using a goods vehicle loaded with particularly long tree tr@@ un@@ ks , we also tested whether such vehicles could access the b 33 from the sul@@ z@@ b@@ ach@@ we@@ g without kno@@ cking over the traffic light posts &quot; .
the traffic light system itself , which cost around eur 15@@ ,000 , is the &quot; most modern system that is currently available on the market , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
the system is fitted with col@@ oured le@@ ds , which are bright enough that drivers can easily see the lights , even when the sun is low in the sky .
and they are also ener@@ g@@ y-@@ efficient : the older light systems con@@ sume around 100 wat@@ ts , with the new ones consum@@ ing just eight .
there are three sets of lights per direction of travel .
ar@@ no@@ ld explained the technology used by the new system : it is fitted with two rad@@ ar sen@@ sors .
if the pede@@ strian pres@@ ses the button at the traffic lights , the top rad@@ ar sensor checks the traffic status .
if the street is clear , the pede@@ strian ob@@ tains a green light immediately , if not , there is a delay of around 15 seconds .
an additional rad@@ ar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pede@@ strian can be ended .
&quot; if a group of people or if disabled persons are crossing the street , the green phase is extended , thus ensuring that everyone gets safe@@ ly across the street , &quot; explained ar@@ no@@ ld .
of course , drivers must also play their part and keep their eyes on the road .
yesterday this was not the case : the light had bare@@ ly turned green for pede@@ stri@@ ans when a luxury vehicle sp@@ ed through on a red light .
for more than 30 years , jo@@ se@@ f win@@ k@@ ler has been writing from the heart , telling of the hard@@ ships of his child@@ hood and youth .
the catastro@@ ph@@ es of his catho@@ lic village up@@ bringing - the speec@@ h@@ less@@ ness , his tend@@ ency towards br@@ ute force and dul@@ led sex@@ u@@ ality , the con@@ fin@@ ement and lack of joy - all of this has been described many times by the ka@@ ern@@ ten@@ -@@ born po@@ et .
the b@@ ü@@ ch@@ ner pri@@ ze@@ winner is known primarily as a writer of pro@@ se , with theatre texts something of a r@@ arity for him .
in a coll@@ age of pro@@ se texts for his performance piece , &quot; we@@ t@@ ter@@ le@@ u@@ ch@@ ten auf der z@@ un@@ gen@@ sp@@ it@@ ze &quot; ( summer light@@ ning on the tip of your ton@@ gue ) , which can now be seen in garage x on pe@@ ter@@ s@@ platz , ger@@ hard fres@@ ach@@ er , creates a coll@@ age of pro@@ se texts .
the theatre producer has thus combined elements from the auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ ically inspired novel &quot; der le@@ i@@ be@@ i@@ gen@@ e &quot; ( 198@@ 7 ) &#91; the bon@@ d@@ sman &#93; featuring pro@@ se mini@@ atures from &quot; le@@ ich@@ nam , se@@ ine famili@@ e be@@ lau@@ er@@ nd &quot; ( 2003 ) &#91; cor@@ pse , stal@@ king his family &#93; .
on the pre@@ domin@@ antly empty stage - with one important requirement : a cr@@ um@@ pled sof@@ a , on which cast members al@@ lu@@ de to cop@@ ulating and ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ating - the eigh@@ t-@@ person en@@ sem@@ ble work their way through the text material .
however , director fres@@ ach@@ er seems to have little trust in the text .
the 7@@ 0-@@ minute performance g@@ losses over the script with a host of director &apos;s addi@@ tions , well-known from the reper@@ to@@ ire of post-@@ dramatic theat@@ r@@ ical styles .
in particular , the ac@@ t@@ res@@ ses play a major role in the sometimes rather du@@ bi@@ ous st@@ aging .
they are man@@ handled , their heads held under water , tack@@ ed to the wall by their evening go@@ wn@@ s .
wra@@ pped in cel@@ lo@@ ph@@ ane or in gir@@ d@@ les , they st@@ um@@ ble on danger@@ ously high he@@ els across the set , either deli@@ vering mono@@ lo@@ gues at the top of their vo@@ ices or lying completely silent on the stage .
however , the source text makes bare@@ ly any reference to this intense delivery .
the best moments of the evening is when the sing@@ ing starts - tracks range from deep pur@@ ple to traditional fol@@ k songs .
only towards the end does the highly charged performance start to wind down , and we see fl@@ ash@@ es of win@@ k@@ ler &apos;s somewhat absur@@ d sense of hum@@ our .
a black box in your car ?
as america &apos;s road pl@@ ann@@ ers struggle to find the cash to m@@ end a cr@@ um@@ bling highway system , many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box that f@@ its ne@@ at@@ ly by the d@@ ash@@ board of your car .
the devices , which track every m@@ ile a motor@@ ist drives and trans@@ mit that information to bureaucr@@ ats , are at the center of a controversial attempt in washington and state planning offices to over@@ hau@@ l the out@@ dated system for funding america &apos;s major roads .
the usually dul@@ l arena of highway planning has suddenly spa@@ w@@ ned intense debate and color@@ ful al@@ li@@ ances .
liber@@ tari@@ ans have joined environmental groups in lob@@ b@@ ying to allow government to use the little boxes to keep track of the miles you drive , and possibly where you drive them - then use the information to draw up a tax bill .
the tea party is ag@@ h@@ ast .
the american civil liberties union is deeply concerned , too , raising a variety of privacy issues .
and while congress can &apos;t agree on whether to proceed , several states are not waiting .
they are exploring how , over the next decade , they can move to a system in which drivers pay per m@@ ile of road they roll over .
thousands of mo@@ tori@@ sts have already taken the black boxes , some of which have g@@ ps monitoring , for a test drive .
this really is a must for our nation .
&quot; it is not a matter of something we might choose to do , &quot; said has@@ an i@@ k@@ hr@@ ata , executive director of the southern california ass@@ n@@ . of governments , which is planning for the state to start tracking miles driven by every california motor@@ ist by 20@@ 25 .
there is going to be a change in how we pay these taxes .
the technology is there to do it .
the push comes as the country &apos;s highway trust fund , financed with taxes americans pay at the gas pum@@ p , is bro@@ ke .
americans don &apos;t buy as much gas as they used to .
cars get many more miles to the gall@@ on .
the federal tax itself , 18@@ .@@ 4 c@@ ents per gall@@ on , has@@ n &apos;t gone up in 20 years .
politicians are lo@@ ath to raise the tax even one pen@@ ny when gas prices are high .
&quot; the gas tax is just not sustainable , &quot; said le@@ e mun@@ n@@ ich , a transportation policy expert at the university of min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a .
his state recently put tracking devices on 500 cars to test out a pay@@ -@@ by-@@ m@@ ile system .
&quot; this works out as the most logical alternative over the long term , &quot; he said .
won@@ ks call it a mil@@ e@@ ag@@ e-@@ based user fee .
it is no surprise that the idea appe@@ als to urban liber@@ als , as the taxes could be ri@@ gged to change driving patterns in ways that could help reduce cong@@ es@@ tion and greenhouse g@@ ases , for example .
california pl@@ ann@@ ers are looking to the system as they dev@@ ise strategies to meet the goals laid out in the state &apos;s ambitious global warming laws .
but rep@@ . bill sh@@ us@@ ter ( r-@@ pa . ) , chairman of the house transportation committee , has said he , too , sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .
the free marke@@ te@@ ers at the reason foundation are also f@@ ond of having drivers pay per m@@ ile .
&quot; this is not just a tax going into a black hole , &quot; said adri@@ an mo@@ ore , vice president of policy at reason .
people are paying more directly into what they are getting .
the movement is also bol@@ ste@@ red by two former u.s. transportation secre@@ tar@@ ies , who in a 2011 report ur@@ ged congress to move in the pay@@ -@@ per@@ -@@ m@@ ile direction .
the u.s. sen@@ ate approved a $ 9@@ 0-@@ million pilot project last year that would have involved about 10@@ ,000 cars .
but the house leadership killed the proposal , acting on concerns of rural law@@ makers representing constitu@@ ents whose daily lives often involve lo@@ gging lots of miles to get to work or into town .
several states and cities are nonetheless moving ahead on their own .
the most e@@ ager is o@@ reg@@ on , which is en@@ li@@ sting 5@@ ,000 drivers in the country &apos;s biggest experim@@ ent .
those drivers will soon pay the mil@@ e@@ age fees instead of gas taxes to the state .
ne@@ v@@ ada has already completed a pilot .
new york city is looking into one .
il@@ lin@@ o@@ is is trying it on a limited basis with tr@@ uc@@ ks .
and the i-@@ 95 coalition , which includes 17 state transportation departments along the eastern se@@ abo@@ ard ( including mar@@ y@@ land , pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and fl@@ ori@@ da ) , is stu@@ dying how they could go about implementing the change .
the concept is not a universal hit .
in ne@@ v@@ ada , where about 50 volunte@@ ers &apos; cars were equipped with the devices not long ago , drivers were un@@ easy about the government being able to monitor their every move .
&quot; concerns about big brother and those sor@@ ts of things were a major problem , &quot; said al@@ aud@@ din kh@@ an , who direc@@ ts strategic and performance management at the ne@@ v@@ ada department of transportation .
it was not something people wanted .
as the trial got under@@ way , the ac@@ l@@ u of ne@@ v@@ ada war@@ ned on its website : &quot; it would be fairly easy to turn these devices into full-@@ fle@@ d@@ ged tracking devices . &quot;
there is no need to build an enormous , un@@ wi@@ el@@ dy technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of individuals &apos; everyday comings and go@@ ings .
ne@@ v@@ ada is among several states now scr@@ am@@ bling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to keep track of how many miles a car is being driven , but not exactly where and at what time .
if you can do that , kh@@ an said , the public gets more comfortable .
the hun@@ t for that technology has led some state agencies to a small california star@@ tup called true mil@@ e@@ age .
the firm was not originally in the business of helping states tax drivers .
it was seeking to break into an emerging market in auto insurance , in which drivers would pay based on their mil@@ e@@ age .
but the devices it is testing appeal to highway pl@@ ann@@ ers because they don &apos;t use g@@ ps and deliver a limited amount of information , up@@ loaded perio@@ dic@@ ally by mode@@ m .
&quot; people will be more willing to do this if you do not track their speed and you do not track their location , &quot; said ry@@ an mor@@ ris@@ on , chief executive of true mil@@ e@@ age .
there have been some big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs .
there are a lot less expensive and less in@@ tru@@ sive ways to do this .
in o@@ reg@@ on , pl@@ ann@@ ers are experim@@ enting with giving drivers different choices .
they can choose a device with or without g@@ ps .
or they can choose not to have a device at all , op@@ ting instead to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles driven by all state residents .
other places are ho@@ ping to sell the concept to a w@@ ary public by having the devices do more , not less .
in new york city , transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax@@ ing device that would also be equipped to pay parking meter fees , provide &quot; pay@@ -@@ as@@ -@@ you@@ -@@ drive &quot; insurance , and create a pool of real-@@ time speed data from other drivers that mo@@ tori@@ sts could use to avoid traffic .
&quot; mo@@ tori@@ sts would be attrac@@ ted to participate because of the value of the benefits it offers to them , &quot; says a city planning document .
some transportation pl@@ ann@@ ers , though , wonder if all the talk about paying by the m@@ ile is just a giant di@@ str@@ action .
at the metro@@ politan transportation commission in the san francis@@ co bay area , officials say congress could very simply deal with the bank@@ ru@@ pt highway trust fund by raising gas taxes .
an extra one-@@ time or annual lev@@ y could be imposed on drivers of hy@@ bri@@ ds and others whose vehicles don &apos;t use much gas , so they pay their fair share .
&quot; there is no need for radical sur@@ gery when all you need to do is take an asp@@ ir@@ in , &quot; said r@@ and@@ y rent@@ sch@@ ler , the commission &apos;s director of legislation and public affairs .
if we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and a host of other things .
kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d : small team gives a spi@@ ri@@ ted performance
the voluntary fire service bra@@ vely came through the main autumn test run in spite of a lack of personnel .
only ele@@ ven men took part in the exercise .
for the training exercise , department comm@@ ander , h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer , chose the fe@@ der premises on bur@@ g@@ ber@@ ger stras@@ se .
a short-@@ circuit was reported to have occurred there during sa@@ wing .
two people were in@@ ju@@ red by the resulting fire and the spread of smo@@ ke , however , one was able to make an emergency call .
two fire figh@@ ters equipped with resp@@ ir@@ atory gear prepared to enter the building following the initial inspection of the situation by h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer .
after a short time they managed to find the first person and direct them out of the building .
the second person had to be carried .
this was not so simple as they also had to negotiate a narrow sta@@ ir@@ well .
the building , a workshop with integrated stab@@ ling for two horses , was not easy to secure .
there were large quantities of wood and bal@@ es of stra@@ w stored inside .
in addition to this , there were also electrical machines for wood processing .
the first attempt to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fire was made using the tan@@ k on the fire engine .
another line was taken from the surface hy@@ dr@@ ant around 100 metres away .
only three attempts could be made to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the bla@@ ze .
a hol@@ low-@@ stream no@@ zz@@ le in the building was also used .
for h@@ ans kam@@ me@@ rer , the exercise was also a chance to show what can be achieved with just a few available staff .
in case of emergency , support is provided by the kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ fel@@ d day@@ time task force .
the comm@@ ander expressed his satisfaction following the exercise .
net@@ working between universities and companies is important
on a visit to the district of bre@@ is@@ gau@@ -@@ ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , it was explained to parliamentary president gui@@ do wol@@ f in ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt where the work@@ force of tomorrow will come from .
in the ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d support centre , he addressed this important question alongside the executive princip@@ als of the vocational col@@ leg@@ es and the district gram@@ mar school and the chairs of the parents &apos; council .
&quot; education is an important factor for the location , &quot; highlighted cla@@ u@@ dia ste@@ h@@ le , director of the h@@ ans th@@ om@@ a school , which introduced the net@@ worked ho@@ ch@@ sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d education centre schools project .
during the presentation , wol@@ f seemed impres@@ sed by the educational pilot project .
since 2011 , there has been successful collaboration in w@@ ä@@ l@@ der@@ stadt between the support centre , the district gram@@ mar school and the vocational school complex .
he also p@@ raised the family-@@ friendly approach within the district .
&quot; it is important , not only to keep the family life stage in mind , but , on account of demographic change , the period spent providing long-term care and support for rela@@ tives as well , &quot; explained wol@@ f .
he also stated that an increasing number of employed persons are looking after the long-term care and support of rela@@ tives .
&quot; without support from their employ@@ er , the resulting burden placed on employees could result in the termin@@ ation of the employment contract , &quot; said wol@@ f .
however , nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , &quot; he added .
another , particularly important factor is that of net@@ working between universities and companies .
&quot; after all , people who have learned of the mer@@ its of the region during their studies often remain within the region , along with their acquired knowledge and skills , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , &quot; said the state parliamentary president , expressing his thorough convic@@ tion .
for it is only if a sufficient number of educational places can be provided that the need for skilled workers can be covered .
in his opinion , the district &apos;s advantage as a location is its advant@@ ageous location in south-@@ west germany , in immediate proximity to france and switzerland .
in addition to this , on his train journey from ti@@ ti@@ se@@ e-@@ neu@@ stadt to fre@@ i@@ burg , he experienced first-@@ hand the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport .
&quot; you must continue to be ten@@ ac@@ ious and make sure that local public transport becomes even better , &quot; he explained in the address given to the local politicians in att@@ end@@ ance .
music makes for an enter@@ taining afternoon
it was 15 years ago that the k@@ aul family first invited the di@@ et@@ ingen senior citizens for coffee and ca@@ ke , followed by a sn@@ ack .
previously , the elderly citizens were ho@@ sted in the service station can@@ teen .
the coffee afternoon is now held in the st. jo@@ se@@ f nur@@ sing home .
the residents of the home were delighted with the delicious ca@@ kes and tar@@ ts .
later on , a sa@@ usage sal@@ ad was provided .
sil@@ via k@@ im@@ mic@@ h-@@ ban@@ tle and her father kar@@ l k@@ imm@@ ich enter@@ tained those in att@@ end@@ ance with popular tun@@ es .
the more than 10@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old natural stone wall , serving as the foremost b@@ ound@@ ary between the old school yard - which is due to be renovated - and kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se , will once again feature on the renov@@ ation cost plan for the town of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en .
in the days before the kil@@ big autumn fol@@ k festival , when the first renov@@ ation work was being carried out at the front of the school yard , a small corner wall with bal@@ u@@ str@@ ades was installed to stabil@@ ise and reli@@ eve the sta@@ tic load on the old natural stone wall , which is more than one hundred years old .
according to alexander mis@@ ok of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en municip@@ al planning and building control authority , the ongoing procedure plans to involve the regional mem@@ orial authority in the planning stage and to draw up a renov@@ ation concept for the old wall .
a cost calcul@@ ation is to be performed by a team of professionals , which will then be submitted to the town council , which will make a decision and determine the ongoing procedure .
a decision is expected to be made in the coming year .
following the renov@@ ation , pla@@ stering and plan@@ ting of trees in the old internal school yard , within the two w@@ ings of the 19@@ 12 school , as a subsequent measure the b@@ ound@@ ary wall , which is in need of refurb@@ ishment , must be renovated from the ground up within the fores@@ ee@@ able future .
the historic , one hundre@@ d-@@ year-@@ old b@@ ound@@ ary wall between the old scho@@ ol@@ -@@ yard and kir@@ ch@@ stras@@ se is in need of renov@@ ation , primarily as a result of water and fro@@ st damage , on account of the lack of dra@@ in@@ age , and is le@@ an@@ ing for@@ wards .
deep cr@@ acks in a number of individual stones testi@@ fy to the weather damage , however , at present the wall is not in danger of collapse .
a secure wall is essential for a school yard that is used by pu@@ pil@@ s , and this is the purpose of the current for@@ ti@@ fication work .
the school yard renov@@ ation was originally planned back in 2008 / 2009 , however , high un@@ planned expenses meant that the work had to be pus@@ hed back .
the regional mem@@ orial authority will have a major say in the historic school wall renov@@ ation , which has even been used for fil@@ ming .
if this authority were to impose requirements , then the town of br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en would hope to receive subsidies from the mon@@ ument preser@@ va@@ tion@@ ists .
the pu@@ pil@@ s of the br@@ ä@@ un@@ ling@@ en primary school , who are now being taught in a well renovated old school building , with a new hall , will soon be able to use the old school yard as well .
ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir wants jazz training in stutt@@ gart
ce@@ m ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , federal chairman of the green party , has now engaged in the ongoing discussions regarding the future of the bad@@ en-@@ w@@ u@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg music academy .
&quot; i do not think it is right to aband@@ on comprehensive training in the stutt@@ gart music college , &quot; said ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , speaking to the &quot; stutt@@ gar@@ ter n@@ ach@@ rich@@ ten &quot; .
jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location of stutt@@ gart .
as such , ö@@ z@@ dem@@ ir , who is the favourite in stutt@@ gart for a direct mandate in the parliamentary elections on 22 september , is in dis@@ agreement with the green@@ -@@ red state government .
on the basis of an expert study , this government is ur@@ ging the re@@ organisation of the five music col@@ leg@@ es in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ u@@ er@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
in accordance with these plans , the jazz and pop courses , among others , are to be re@@ located from the stutt@@ gart music college to the man@@ n@@ heim music college .
us borders : &quot; super tunnel &quot; for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling discovered
on the border between mexico and the usa , investig@@ ators have discovered and sh@@ ut down a &quot; super tunnel &quot; intended for drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling .
as announced by the us customs authorities , the pi@@ pe between ti@@ ju@@ ana and san di@@ e@@ go , measuring more than 500 metres in length , was equipped with electricity , a railway track and a v@@ enti@@ lation system .
three susp@@ ects were de@@ tained in relation to the discovery , with eight tonnes of mari@@ ju@@ ana and almost 150 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s of co@@ ca@@ ine se@@ ized .
according to the details provided , the tunnel had not yet been put into use .
&quot; these car@@ te@@ ls are st@@ up@@ id if they think that they can di@@ g through under the rad@@ ar , &quot; said the us att@@ or@@ ney for the district of southern california , la@@ ura diff@@ y , at a press conference held in front of a ware@@ house in san di@@ e@@ go , where the end of the tunnel was discovered .
referring to the drug gan@@ gs , du@@ ff@@ y assured : &quot; if you continue to build and attempt to use these tun@@ nels , we are determined to make this a big waste of your dir@@ ty money &quot; .
both the us authorities and the mex@@ ic@@ an security forces are engaged in an ongoing battle against the drug car@@ te@@ ls .
since 2006 , more than 7@@ 7@@ ,000 people have been killed in conjunction with drug crime in mexico .
built by experts
due to the elabor@@ ate configuration of the tunnel , investig@@ ators are working on the as@@ sumption that it was build by architec@@ ts and engineers and that the construction took around one year .
the railway system was equipped in such a way that electr@@ ically powered car@@ ts could be used on it .
on the mex@@ ic@@ an side , the entrance is located in a building located 80 metres from the border .
according to the authorities , a lad@@ der runs 20 metres underground to the actual entrance of the tunnel .
the tunnel has a cross-@@ section measuring 1.@@ 20 metres high and 90 cen@@ ti@@ metres across .
it would thus be suitable to assist illegal immigration into the usa .
two of the susp@@ ects were de@@ tained in conjunction with the co@@ ca@@ ine find .
the third , a mex@@ ic@@ an , was de@@ tained due to the se@@ iz@@ ure of the mari@@ ju@@ ana .
all three face a maximum penalty of life imprison@@ ment , according to the authorities .
since 2006 , eight tun@@ nels of this type have been discovered , the press conference in san di@@ e@@ go continued .
however , this was the first time that co@@ ca@@ ine was found in such a tunnel construction .
normally co@@ ca@@ ine is s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led in smaller quantities and not through tun@@ nels .
this shows the &quot; desper@@ ation &quot; of the drug gan@@ gs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , said bill sh@@ er@@ man of the de@@ a drug squ@@ ad in san di@@ e@@ go .
they will do anything to make it to the usa .
no specific details were given regarding those de@@ tained , but it is reported that at least one is mex@@ ic@@ an
they can expect prison terms of up to ten years .
20@@ 14 is to be a year of celebr@@ ation in ge@@ is@@ ingen
the anniversary celebra@@ tions in the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen , to mark the 1,@@ 2@@ 50@@ th
anniversary of the first docum@@ ented mention of the town , are drawing closer .
when the year comes to an end in just eight weeks , the anniversary year will be upon us .
ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en were first docum@@ ented together in the year 7@@ 94 .
a de@@ ed was drafted in kir@@ chen , in which both towns are mentioned .
on 15 march , the anniversary year will be officially launched , and because ge@@ is@@ ingen currently has no suitable ven@@ ues , this launch event will take place in the location where the two towns were first docum@@ ented 1,@@ 250 years ago , in kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
as part of the anniversary celebra@@ tions , a number of events are planned both in ge@@ is@@ ingen and kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en .
kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en will celebrate the 1,@@ 2@@ 50@@ th anniversary with a celebr@@ atory weekend from 18 to 20
july .
on the friday there will be a cere@@ mony , and on the saturday and sunday a party will be held at the kir@@ ch@@ tal@@ hal@@ le .
the kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en kir@@ chen@@ fest festival will also be held on this celebr@@ atory weekend .
town musical director , ru@@ dol@@ f bar@@ th , has composed a commission@@ ed piece for the town on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed on three dates .
on 21 june , in conjunction with the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d@@ vere@@ in &#91; black forest association &#93; mid-@@ summer festival , on 12 july in the arena , accompanied by fire@@ works , and on 13 december as the first concert put on by the stad@@ t@@ musi@@ k ( town musical society ) in the new festival hall .
this venue will be completed and in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ated in the anniversary year , with the official date set for the last weekend in september , on 27 and 28 september .
on the occasion of the ge@@ is@@ ingen town anniversary , a new chron@@ ic@@ le will also be published .
&quot; however , it will not merely be a chron@@ ic@@ le of ge@@ is@@ ingen itself , but rather a printed work on the ge@@ is@@ ingen of today , which now consists of ge@@ is@@ ingen , kir@@ ch@@ en-@@ haus@@ en , le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen , a@@ ul@@ fing@@ en and gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen , &quot; said may@@ or wal@@ ter h@@ eng@@ st@@ ler .
and the ge@@ is@@ ingen of today is also celebr@@ ating a birth@@ day in 20@@ 14 , as it was in 197@@ 4 that the incorpor@@ ations to form the current region were completed .
the new chron@@ ic@@ le is to be presented on 21 or 22 november in the new festival hall in ge@@ is@@ ingen .
however , 20@@ 14 is also a year of many anni@@ vers@@ aries in other respects .
the nar@@ ren@@ z@@ un@@ ft stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki ( stro@@ h@@ gl@@ on@@ ki fo@@ ol &apos;s guil@@ d celebr@@ ation ) begins on 8 february with an evening of traditional customs on the occasion of its 6@@ 0-@@ year anniversary / the harmon@@ ie gu@@ t@@ mad@@ ingen music association will turn 90 years old and on 29 march will hold a celebr@@ atory ban@@ quet and then from 1 to 4 may will be celebr@@ ating the be@@ z@@ ir@@ k@@ s@@ fest &#91; district music festival &#93; .
the le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen nur@@ sing home will turn 40 years old , the ge@@ is@@ ingen school has now been at its new location for 50 years and will be celebr@@ ating this on 10 may , and the poly@@ hy@@ m@@ nia le@@ ip@@ fer@@ d@@ ingen music association will turn 150 years old and will be celebr@@ ating this as part of the brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest &#91; foun@@ tain festival &#93; from 4 to 7 july .
the town of ge@@ is@@ ingen was first officially docum@@ ented in the year 7@@ 64 , in a de@@ ed of don@@ ation , which is now in the pos@@ session of the st. g@@ allen monaster@@ y .
the de@@ ed was drawn up in kir@@ chen ( haus@@ en ) , which at the time was the location of the cour@@ thouse .
both communities are thus mentioned in the same de@@ ed .
one reason for choosing 20@@ 14 to celebrate the 1,@@ 2@@ 50@@ -@@ year anniversary in this way , is that it also coinci@@ des with the 40@@ th anniversary of the community reform ( gem@@ e@@ inde@@ reform ) .
council sets its sights on rail system
should the &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; railway crossing be re@@ constructed at great cost , in order to increase traffic safety ?
the town counc@@ ils have decided that the answer is yes .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach will have to contribute up to eur 2@@ 20@@ ,000 to the project .
the deutsche bahn hopes to improve the kin@@ zi@@ g@@ tal railway line in the coming year .
in particular , safety at railway cros@@ s@@ ings is to be increased - col@@ li@@ sions between trains and other vehicles frequently occur at these across the country .
if the municip@@ alities agree to the reconstruction measures , they will be required to contribute one third of the costs , with the remain@@ der divided between deutsche bahn and the federal government .
sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach &apos;s town master mas@@ on , ro@@ land gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er , explained the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ arities of the &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; railway crossing to the town council .
at the crossing , the town is planning to increase the height of the mouth of the tunnel to the west of the railway line .
larger vehicles , for example those that transport long log@@ s , would be able to wait there in the event of on@@ coming traffic , without having to block the railway line .
gri@@ e@@ ß@@ hab@@ er therefore suggested that a required supporting wall be constructed in such a way that the town could in due course wi@@ den the ad@@ joining street in order to guarantee the smooth flow of traffic .
this was the subject of controversial discussion in the town council , as some council members cast doubt over the need to wi@@ den the road : thomas ki@@ p@@ p summar@@ ised the perspective of the cri@@ tics with this statement : &quot; do we have to hand over so much money on account of so few vehicles ? &quot;
may@@ or thomas ha@@ as re@@ tor@@ ted : the &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; railway crossing is used regularly for the transportation of long log@@ s .
even wood from the &quot; ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; area is occa@@ sion@@ ally trans@@ ported via this route , as the vehicles , which measure 20 metres in length , would not be able to use the route via the h@@ ä@@ ber@@ les bridge , as they would not be able to make the turn on the ha@@ up@@ t@@ stras@@ se .
furthermore , when the ha@@ up@@ t@@ stras@@ se is bloc@@ ked , the route would also serve as a by@@ pass for those vehicles that are not permitted to use the tunnel , argu@@ ed ha@@ as .
given that it is likely that the kir@@ ch@@ berg and sch@@ los@@ s@@ berg tunnel will have to be re@@ constructed and renovated , as is currently the case in wol@@ fac@@ h , the &quot; am h@@ ir@@ sch@@ en &quot; railway crossing may become of major traffic significance for a longer period of time .
the counc@@ ill@@ ors agreed to have an investigation conducted as to what costs the planned wid@@ ening of the road would inc@@ ur .
nevertheless , the reconstruction of the railway crossing was consen@@ ted to by a majority , on the provision that the required supporting wall be built in such a way that the town could , if required , extend the connecting road in the &quot; ba@@ hn@@ ho@@ f@@ stra@@ ß@@ e &quot; direction to around 5.@@ 5 metres to accommodate on@@ coming traffic .
the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the tr@@ aut@@ we@@ in t@@ ann@@ ery could , on the other hand , bring with it an entirely different problem with regard to access to the ste@@ ep &quot; ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g &quot; .
the administrative department had deutsche bahn &apos;s reconstruction plans investig@@ ated by the bre@@ in@@ ling@@ er engineering office , as they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the ger@@ ol@@ tz@@ h@@ ä@@ user we@@ g will be stra@@ i@@ ght@@ forward .
the investigation came to the conclusion that it could not be rul@@ ed out that the inc@@ lin@@ ation of the road could result in longer vehicles becoming st@@ uck .
the town , as the authority responsible for road construction , would then bear responsibility for this .
the reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .
because both the transportation of wood and turning are both possible as things are , the reconstruction of the railway crossing should not be consen@@ ted to , argu@@ ed ha@@ as .
at this point , the risk of a train col@@ li@@ sion with a vehicle posi@@ tioned on the crossing is considerably lower than at other railway cros@@ s@@ ings , on account of the fact that there is a mid@@ point from which there is a good line of sight , directly alongside the stop@@ ping point .
the trains themselves , coming from the central station , must also be sufficiently slow@@ ed down so that there is no threat of col@@ li@@ sion .
according to the counc@@ ill@@ ors , the reconstruction of this railway line was rejected by a majority , as the town of sch@@ il@@ t@@ ach would &quot; bear the brun@@ t of the cost &quot; for the problem of vehicles becoming st@@ uck , since the deutsche bahn would be able to deny any responsibility following the completion of the construction work .
the committee considers the reconstruction of the &quot; v@@ or heu@@ bach &quot; and &apos; v@@ or ku@@ h@@ bach &quot; railway cros@@ s@@ ings , for which the crossing agreements have already been reached with deutsche bahn , to be un@@ proble@@ matic .
es@@ a makes decision on major space missions : missions co@@ sting bil@@ lions
dist@@ ant plan@@ ets , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves or black ho@@ les - experts from the european space agency must now agree on two major projects that are to be launched in the coming years .
there were 30 proposals to choose from , five of which are still in the running .
dist@@ ant worl@@ ds .
a@@ stronom@@ ers have already found more than 1@@ ,000 plan@@ ets near other stars .
whether or not life exists on at least some of these , no-@@ one knows .
the choice is a difficult one : should we search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
or instead conduct research into the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s ?
or search for plan@@ ets similar to the earth and thus perhaps discover extr@@ at@@ er@@ re@@ stri@@ al life ?
these are the questions currently being asked by those responsible at the european space agency , es@@ a .
for their &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which should greatly advance research .
the budget for &quot; l-@@ missions &quot; such as this lies at around one billion euro .
the projects are planned to start in 20@@ 28 and 20@@ 34 .
at the beginning of september , the elite in the field of european space research met in paris to discuss proposals for such missions .
30 ideas were up for debate , of which five have now made it onto the short list .
numerous panels are assess@@ ing the proposals , posing questions to the researchers .
over the coming days , a final decision is to be made by the scientific programme committee .
in total , four main questions were chosen by the es@@ a , to which the missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme , initiated in 2007 , are to find the answers .
what are the conditions required for the formation of plan@@ ets and life ?
the precise processes for the formation of stars from large gas cl@@ ou@@ ds - and thus the formation of the plan@@ ets that or@@ bit these stars - lie in pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al dar@@ k@@ ness .
a large infra@@ -@@ red tel@@ es@@ cope in space could pen@@ etr@@ ate this dar@@ k@@ ness .
and if a star has plan@@ ets , under what circumstances can life exist there ?
in order to pursue this question , the &quot; che@@ ops &quot; space tel@@ es@@ cope is to be launched in 20@@ 17 , with which 500 known plan@@ etary systems in proximity to us will be investig@@ ated in greater detail .
the possibilities are , however , limited - che@@ ops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euro .
with larger instruments , a@@ stronom@@ ers could map plan@@ ets similar to earth and even analy@@ se the composition of their atmo@@ sp@@ he@@ res , and thus search for &quot; bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers &quot; : g@@ ases that serve as an indic@@ ator for biological activity .
how does the solar system function ?
this question should also provide information regarding the pre@@ conditions for the origin@@ s of life .
the magnetic activity of a star , the interaction of its magnetic field and the em@@ it@@ ted partic@@ le radiation play an important role .
it is possible to investigate these processes in our solar system , to serve as an example to be applied elsewhere .
with the &quot; solar or@@ bi@@ ter &quot; , the es@@ a has already approved an m-@@ class mission ( for which the budget stands at around half a million euro ) to address this matter .
the pro@@ be is to be launched in 20@@ 17 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun .
j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and its mo@@ ons are also of great interest to the researchers .
they want to find our what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .
the es@@ a is planning that the first of the total of three l-@@ missions of the &quot; co@@ sm@@ ic vision &quot; programme will address this subject .
the &quot; ju@@ ice &quot; ( j@@ up@@ i@@ ter ic@@ y mo@@ ons explorer ) pro@@ be is planned to begin its journey in 20@@ 22 .
eight years later it will reach j@@ up@@ i@@ ter and will investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ic@@ y mo@@ ons euro@@ pa , call@@ is@@ to and gan@@ y@@ me@@ de .
what are the basic physical laws of the universe ?
ou@@ ter space offers many possibilities for stu@@ dying substances under extreme conditions and thus exam@@ ining whether the laws of nature , as known to us , are still valid there .
there may also be de@@ vi@@ ations that could show physi@@ ci@@ ans the path to a new theory , under the um@@ bre@@ lla of which all known natural laws could be united .
how did the universe come about and what does it consist of ?
13@@ .@@ 7 billion years ago , our co@@ smo@@ s was created by the big ban@@ g .
alongside the materials familiar to us , from which stars , plan@@ ets and life forms such as ourselves are composed , there exists dark matter , the gra@@ vit@@ ational force of which holds gal@@ ax@@ ies and gal@@ ax@@ y clu@@ sters together , and dark energy , the effects of which acceler@@ ate the expansion of the universe .
thus far , researchers know neither which physical laws applied in the initial moments after the big ban@@ g , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .
with &quot; eu@@ cli@@ d &quot; , the es@@ a has already approved an m-@@ mission , planned to comm@@ ence in 2020 .
with a special tel@@ es@@ cope , the pro@@ be is to examine the distribution of material in the universe across the entire sky , thus enabling conclusions to be drawn regarding the properties of dark matter and dark energy .
proposals that are in the running ...
of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .
the proposal with the best chance of approval as an l-@@ mission , in the opinion of many experts , is &quot; e-@@ lis@@ a &quot; , a demanding concept that aims to prove the existence of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
many physi@@ ci@@ ans per@@ cei@@ ve this to enta@@ il changes in the structure of spac@@ e-@@ time , which al@@ bert e@@ inste@@ in predic@@ ted almost 100 years ago .
to date they have never been proved to exist .
the scientists behind the project hope that el@@ is@@ a could achieve this .
the mission involves placing a detec@@ tor , consisting of two or three prob@@ es , in ou@@ ter space .
unlike systems on earth , it could also prove gra@@ vit@@ ational waves created during the big ban@@ g , and thus provide fresh knowledge regarding the origin of the co@@ smo@@ s .
four other proposals are still compe@@ ting for the second l-@@ mission place : a large x-@@ ray tel@@ es@@ cope called &quot; ath@@ ena &quot; , which among other things would research black ho@@ les , &quot; ic@@ y plan@@ ets &quot; , another mission to the ou@@ ter plan@@ ets of the solar system , &quot; pr@@ ism &quot; , a mission for the measurement of co@@ sm@@ ic background radiation , and the &quot; ex@@ op@@ lan@@ et fin@@ der &quot; , which would find and investigate plan@@ ets similar to earth .
among others , proposals that have already been rul@@ ed out include proposals for bringing sam@@ ples back from mar@@ s , conduc@@ ting research on the moon , ven@@ us and aster@@ o@@ ids , as well as proposals in the area of solar physi@@ cs .
snow@@ den ready to &quot; cooperate &quot; with germany over us surveillance
ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the us intelligence wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , has declared that he is willing to travel to berlin to give evidence to the german parliament if the us national security agency and its director ke@@ ith alexander fail to provide answers about its activities .
german mp han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le on thursday met mr snow@@ den in russia , where he has been granted asylum , to discuss him testi@@ fying in germany .
a letter from mr snow@@ den , presented to the media in berlin on friday by the mp , said : &quot; though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alise political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence . &quot;
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
in the letter , mr snow@@ den said he believed the support of the international community could persu@@ ade the us government to aband@@ on criminal charges against him .
the charges fil@@ ed by the us justice department include es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and the@@ ft of government property .
han@@ s-@@ peter fried@@ rich , german interior minister , told ze@@ it online : &quot; if mr snow@@ den is ready to speak to german officials , we will find ways to make this possible . &quot;
relations between the us and germany have come under stra@@ in following claims that the n@@ sa bu@@ gged chancell@@ or ang@@ ela &apos;s mer@@ kel &apos;s phone .
thomas op@@ perman@@ n , the mp who heads the parliamentary panel that over@@ sees intelligence , said that if there were an opportunity to hear mr snow@@ den as a witness &quot; without bringing him into danger and completely ru@@ ining relations with the us , &quot; it should be taken .
mr str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , an mp for germany &apos;s green party , published a picture of himself with mr snow@@ den on his t@@ wit@@ ter feed .
he was accompanied on his visit to russia by two german journalists .
mr str@@ ö@@ be@@ le said that , according to the former n@@ sa contrac@@ tor &apos;s law@@ yer , mr snow@@ den would not be able to return to russia if he left .
if mr snow@@ den testi@@ fied in germany he would need assur@@ ances that he would be &quot; safe &quot; there , the mp said .
mr snow@@ den said in his letter that he had faced a &quot; severe and sustained &quot; campaign of persecu@@ tion that forced him from his home .
however he said that he was hear@@ ten@@ ed by the worldwide response to &quot; my act of political expression . &quot;
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the united states - have jud@@ ged the rev@@ el@@ ation of an un@@ accoun@@ table system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
the letter exten@@ ds an offer to cooperate with german authorities &quot; when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved . &quot;
fronti@@ er airlines to charge for car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage
fronti@@ er airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 for passengers to store car@@ r@@ y-@@ on luggage on board their flight .
fronti@@ er airlines plans to start char@@ ging up to $ 100 for a car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag and $ 2 for coffee or so@@ da , although its announcement on wednesday did say that passengers will get to keep the whole can .
the new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee is for bags in the over@@ head b@@ in , so small bags under the seat will still be free .
fronti@@ er said it will charge $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , $ 100 if travel@@ ers wait to pay until they &apos;re at the gate .
fronti@@ er spo@@ kes@@ woman k@@ ate o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the $ 100 fee is to get travel@@ ers to take care of the charge in advance .
&quot; we don &apos;t want to charge that , &quot; she said .
airlines began char@@ ging for the first and second checked bags in 2008 .
passengers trying to avoid those fees have been stu@@ ff@@ ing as much as they can into car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage st@@ ash@@ ed in over@@ head b@@ ins , meaning those b@@ ins often run out of space .
fees are one way to get passengers to bring less on board .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said the new charge is not really about raising money .
it &apos;s about fronti@@ er &apos;s most loy@@ al customers making it very clear that finding over@@ head b@@ in space has become increasingly difficult .
passengers who buy their tickets on the airline &apos;s website won &apos;t have to pay .
that means one passenger in line at a fronti@@ er gate might get to bring a bag on for free , while the next person in line might o@@ we $ 100 for a similar bag .
o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said fronti@@ er &apos;s website and check-in procedures are being changed to make sure passengers know about the fee before they get to the gate .
fronti@@ er &apos;s new car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee won &apos;t start until summer , though a date has@@ n &apos;t been set .
passengers often gr@@ um@@ ble about bag@@ gage charges and other fees , but airlines love them .
they argue that luggage costs money to handle , and passengers who want the service should pay for it .
many on wall street view the addition of bag@@ gage fees as a sign that airlines are char@@ ging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .
most haven &apos;t touched car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fees , though .
spirit airlines inc@@ . started the first car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee three years ago , and fellow dis@@ counter alle@@ giant air later followed .
the only other airline with such a fee is hungary &apos;s wi@@ z@@ z air , said airline consult@@ ant j@@ ay so@@ ren@@ sen , who closely tracks add@@ -@@ on fees .
he estimated in a december 2011 report that spirit &apos;s car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee brings in $ 50 million a year .
so@@ ren@@ sen , a former executive with mid@@ west airlines , fle@@ w spirit recently and won@@ dered what he &apos;d find at the gate as passengers encoun@@ tered spirit &apos;s unusual car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag fee .
&quot; the boarding process was the smo@@ o@@ th@@ est i had seen in my airline career , &quot; he said .
i was expec@@ ting to see gn@@ ash@@ ing of te@@ eth and a fight breaking out at the gate .
the plane was full , he said , &quot; and it boar@@ ded lic@@ ke@@ ty-@@ split . &quot;
fronti@@ er is also following spirit &apos;s $ 2 charge for coffee , tea , so@@ da , or ju@@ ice .
fronti@@ er said passengers who get so@@ da or ju@@ ice can keep the whole can , and it will give coffee ref@@ ills for free .
it will still give away water .
us air@@ ways briefly tried char@@ ging for be@@ ver@@ ages in 2008 but backed down seven months later after passengers compla@@ ined and no other major airline followed .
fronti@@ er &apos;s move to charge the car@@ r@@ y-@@ on fee if passengers don &apos;t buy direct from the airline is its latest effort to ste@@ er customers toward its own website .
airlines pay online travel sel@@ lers such as or@@ bit@@ z $ 10 to $ 25 for each ticket sold .
that has given all airlines an incentive to ste@@ er passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency .
fronti@@ er has gone the fur@@ th@@ est in this area , though .
in september it began giving half as many frequent f@@ lier miles to customers who bought through an online travel agency .
on wednesday it sl@@ ash@@ ed the mil@@ e@@ age award to 25 percent of the miles of the trip .
so , a 1@@ ,000 m@@ ile fronti@@ er trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles .
it also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy directly from the fronti@@ er website .
fronti@@ er has a loy@@ al base of customers in its home city of den@@ ver , but its business is shr@@ in@@ king and losing money .
revenue dro@@ pped 9 percent and its flying capacity sh@@ rank almost 13 percent in the first quarter , according to financial results released wednesday by corporate parent republic air@@ ways hol@@ dings inc .
republic has been trying to fix fronti@@ er &apos;s finances as part of selling the airline .
sa@@ y@@ ings come from the bi@@ ble
at least 40 women attended the last women &apos;s breakfast of the year , in the ev@@ angel@@ ical par@@ ish of bis@@ ingen .
the theme of the day in the par@@ ish hall was &quot; sa@@ y@@ ings from the bi@@ ble &quot; and &quot; expres@@ sions from the middle ages &quot; .
z@@ ita kö@@ h@@ ler , the chair@@ person of the par@@ ish council , agreed to give a talk on bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al pro@@ ver@@ bs after breakfast .
&quot; pro@@ ver@@ bs contain pe@@ ar@@ ls of wis@@ dom , comm@@ and@@ ments or war@@ nings , &quot; she explained .
she compared several german sa@@ y@@ ings with the corresponding bi@@ ble ver@@ ses and explained the meaning .
she referred to sa@@ y@@ ings such as : &quot; hol@@ z@@ au@@ ge se@@ i w@@ ach@@ sa@@ m &quot; ( keep your eyes pe@@ el@@ ed ) , &quot; wi@@ e sch@@ u@@ pp@@ en von den au@@ gen fallen &quot; ( like sc@@ ales falling from one &apos;s eyes ) , &quot; ein au@@ ge auf j@@ em@@ and wer@@ fen &quot; ( to cast an eye on someone ) , &quot; den se@@ in@@ en gi@@ b@@ t &apos;s der her@@ r im sch@@ la@@ f &quot; ( good things come to some when they sleep ) and &quot; se@@ ine h@@ än@@ de in un@@ sch@@ u@@ ld was@@ chen &quot; ( to w@@ ash one &apos;s hands of something ) .
on several occasions , the speaker asked those listening to gu@@ ess what pro@@ ver@@ b they were based on .
expres@@ sions from the middle ages were addressed by par@@ ish counc@@ ill@@ or chris@@ tel de@@ h@@ ner : &quot; all@@ er gu@@ ten d@@ ing@@ e sin@@ d dre@@ i &quot; ( all good things come in thre@@ es ) , &quot; bla@@ u mach@@ en &quot; ( to ski@@ p school / work ) , &quot; et@@ was ver@@ hau@@ en &quot; ( to wal@@ lo@@ p something ) .
she explained the meaning and origin of the expres@@ sions , which she referred to as &quot; brid@@ ges to the past &quot; .
to round off the morning there was a tom@@ bol@@ a .
the pri@@ zes were placed , covered , on a table and were hum@@ or@@ ously par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ased prior to being presented to the winners .
ma@@ yor@@ al candidate roman wa@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger was also to be found among the visitors to the joint breakfast .
learning rather than unemployment : tourism pilot project for the un@@ trained
a pilot project for the tourist industry is being launched today in the mec@@ k@@ len@@ burg lake district .
under the management of the federal employment agency , 49 men and women who are already working within the industry as un@@ trained workers , will be trained as qualified hotel and restaurant staff over the course of three win@@ ters .
&quot; what &apos;s innovative about it is that the six@@ -@@ month courses end with diplom@@ as , &quot; said car@@ men wi@@ ec@@ her@@ t of the neu@@ brand@@ enburg employment agency .
there are many benefits : the participants will not be unemployed , the companies receive trained skilled workers , which are in continually increasing demand in hotels and restaurants , and the agency will not have to fund unemployment .
also involved in the project are the chamber of industry and commerce in neu@@ brand@@ enburg and the german hotel and restaurant association ( deutsche hote@@ l@@ - und ga@@ st@@ st@@ ä@@ tte , de@@ ho@@ ga ) of mec@@ k@@ len@@ bur@@ g-@@ western pom@@ er@@ ania .
n@@ sa bl@@ ames &quot; internal error , &quot; not h@@ ack@@ ers , for website cr@@ ash
the sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y national security agency said late friday that it was a g@@ lit@@ ch that brought down its public website for a few hours , not h@@ ack@@ ers as some claimed online .
&quot; n@@ sa@@ .@@ go@@ v was not accessible for several hours ton@@ ight because of an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update , &quot; the sp@@ y agency said in an em@@ ail@@ ed statement .
the issue will be resolved this evening .
claims that the out@@ age was caused by a distributed den@@ ial of service &#91; d@@ dos &#93; attack are not true .
earlier this evening online server tr@@ ack@@ ers noted the n@@ sa &apos;s website had been down for at least six hours , and the site continues to be in@@ accessible for some users .
earlier an n@@ sa spo@@ kes@@ person told ab@@ c news the agency &apos;s internal , sensitive network was &quot; not at all &quot; com@@ promised .
no classi@@ fied information is in danger , the spo@@ kes@@ person said .
at least one h@@ ack@@ ti@@ vis@@ t group online claimed that they were responsible for bringing down the n@@ sa site with a d@@ dos attack .
d@@ dos attacks are designed to flo@@ od a target website with traffic until the servers are over@@ loaded and the site collap@@ ses .
the cy@@ ber tac@@ tic is a relatively un@@ sophisticated one and the attacks are not meant to pen@@ etr@@ ate the internal network of the target system .
the form@@ erly super secre@@ tive n@@ sa , once n@@ ick@@ named no such agency , has found itself in very public light , and am@@ id v@@ icious criticism , in past months following a stream of rev@@ el@@ ations about is vast foreign and domestic surveillance programs - collec@@ tively the product of secret n@@ sa files sto@@ len from the agency and le@@ ak@@ ed by dis@@ enchan@@ ted former n@@ sa contrac@@ tor ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
such growing contro@@ vers@@ y surrounding the agency promp@@ ted early spec@@ ulation that ton@@ ight &apos;s incident was the result of a targeted cy@@ ber operation .
in october , the number of job@@ less fell slightly by 22 , to a total of 1,@@ 30@@ 7 .
the rate of 3.@@ 1 per cent is indeed better than the previous year and is also better than in september , &quot; however , we had hoped for more , &quot; said mon@@ i@@ ka fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er , acting branch manager of the employment agency in son@@ th@@ of@@ en .
several companies have thus far re@@ acted cau@@ ti@@ ously when it comes to h@@ iring .
st@@ ating a reason for this , fel@@ der@@ -@@ bau@@ er said : &quot; we have bare@@ ly any skilled workers in the fields of skilled cra@@ fts and tr@@ ades , healthcare and ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric care . &quot;
seas@@ onal job offers for staff in hotel and restaurant businesses have been coming in since september .
the winter season within the industry begins in mid-@@ december .

bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er profit di@@ ps as plane deli@@ veries , orders fall
can@@ a@@ dian plane and train maker bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er inc reported a 15 percent fall in net profit on thursday , pres@@ su@@ red by fewer aircraft orders and deli@@ veries in the third quarter and contract issues in its train unit .
mon@@ tre@@ al-@@ based bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er also did not release any flight test data for its br@@ and-@@ new c@@ series aircraft or offer an update on whether the plane will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service by next september .
after the test plane &apos;s in@@ aug@@ ural flight about a month and a half ago , it has only flo@@ wn three more times , raising questions over whether the testing phase is on track .
results fell short of forec@@ asts and sent shares sli@@ ding more than 8 percent on the tor@@ onto stock exchange .
camer@@ on do@@ er@@ k@@ sen , an analy@@ st with national bank financial , lo@@ wered his rating to &quot; sector perform &quot; from &quot; out@@ perform &quot; on thursday with the view that the stock has limited up@@ side over the next one or two quarters .
&quot; while the weak@@ er aircraft deli@@ veries were mostly anticip@@ ated , we are clearly disappointed by the mar@@ gin performance in transportation , &quot; do@@ er@@ k@@ sen said in a client note .
we believe that bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er will receive new orders for the c@@ series as the flight test program progres@@ ses .
however , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we susp@@ ect that the market will become more ske@@ p@@ tical of the program .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er hopes the c@@ series aircraft family can cat@@ ap@@ ult it into the low end of a market now dominated by bo@@ eing and airbus .
the first test plane was un@@ ve@@ iled in march and took flight for the first time in september after months of delays .
but firm orders for the c@@ series are moderate so far at 17@@ 7 as potential bu@@ yers wait for flight test results to vali@@ date the company &apos;s claims about the new j@@ et@@ lin@@ er &apos;s fuel efficiency and cost savings potential .
there are currently 4@@ 03 total orders and commitments with 15 customers and operators .
chief executive officer pi@@ er@@ re beau@@ do@@ in was confident bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet is put into commercial use .
execu@@ tives also reas@@ su@@ red analy@@ sts and media on thursday the program was progres@@ sing according to schedule .
&quot; the test plane didn &apos;t stay on the ground longer than anticip@@ ated , &quot; beau@@ do@@ in said in a conference call , adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane &apos;s down@@ time .
every manufacturer sched@@ ules it in a different way .
we had decided to do a first flight and to do an update period and that &apos;s what we have done .
that will happen all through the flight program .
the second of five test plan@@ es is expected to take flight in the coming weeks , with the remain@@ der following shortly after , the company said .
still , analy@@ sts are ske@@ p@@ tical the first customer can begin operating a c@@ series plane 12 months after its ma@@ ide@@ n flight .
bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er said it was evalu@@ ating the entr@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service ( e@@ is ) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months .
&quot; this slow pace of flight testing - although in line with bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s internal schedule apparently - rein@@ forces our view that entr@@ y-@@ in@@ to-@@ service will be pus@@ hed to q@@ 1 / 15 , &quot; said do@@ er@@ k@@ sen .
for the third quarter ended september 30 , bom@@ bar@@ di@@ er &apos;s net profit fell to $ 14@@ 7 million , or 8 c@@ ents per share , from $ 17@@ 2 million , or 9 c@@ ents per share a year earlier .

co@@ ca@@ in@@ e-@@ ad@@ dic@@ t law@@ yer who ti@@ pped off mr big about police investigation is j@@ ail@@ ed
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed information to crime lord ne@@ il scar@@ br@@ ough
the sol@@ ic@@ itor fe@@ ared his secret drug ad@@ diction would be exposed
was given a three-@@ year prison sentence at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court
a top defence law@@ yer who told a drugs mr big about a major police investigation , because he fe@@ ared his secret drug ad@@ diction would be exposed , has been j@@ ail@@ ed for three years .
bas@@ har@@ at d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , would feed sensitive intelligence to crime lord ne@@ il scar@@ br@@ ough about in@@ qui@@ ries into his drug trafficking activities after he became com@@ promised by his co@@ ca@@ ine hab@@ it .
the sol@@ ic@@ itor , who was n@@ ick@@ named &quot; bas@@ h &quot; and ha@@ iled by crimin@@ als as a &quot; top brief , &quot; was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation into scar@@ bor@@ ough , who he had represented in a previous nar@@ co@@ tics trial .
officers spo@@ t@@ ted sar@@ bor@@ ough , 32 , dro@@ pping off three bags of co@@ ca@@ ine at the law@@ yer &apos;s home in black@@ bur@@ n , lan@@ cas@@ hire , while he was out at a law society dinner with colleagues .
in@@ qui@@ ries revealed d@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of the class a drug after tests found trac@@ es of co@@ ca@@ ine in his hair , on his wal@@ let and on his credit cards .
over an eight month period between january and august 2011 he sought to il@@ lic@@ itly obtain information on the ar@@ re@@ sts of two men on behalf of scar@@ bor@@ ough as well as one of his associ@@ ates .
all four susp@@ ects were being wat@@ ched by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine r@@ ack@@ et operating across lan@@ cas@@ hire , cum@@ bri@@ a , mer@@ se@@ y@@ side , ber@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire .
they and 32 other men were later j@@ ail@@ ed after police se@@ ized her@@ o@@ in and co@@ ca@@ ine worth £ 1.@@ 5@@ million along with more than £ 200@@ ,000 in cash during a series of ra@@ ids .
d@@ it@@ ta , 42 , fed information to crimin@@ als because of fears his co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ diction would be exposed
today at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court d@@ it@@ ta , who works at law firm for@@ bes sol@@ ic@@ itors , based in black@@ bur@@ n , was facing dis@@ gr@@ ace after being found guil@@ ty of two counts of per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice following a three week trial at li@@ ver@@ pool cro@@ wn court .
he ad@@ mitted co@@ ca@@ ine pos@@ session at an earlier hearing .
the law@@ yer &apos;s down@@ fall came after police investig@@ ating scar@@ bor@@ ough discovered he had been in regular phone contact with d@@ it@@ ta in february 2011 .
two detec@@ tives tra@@ iled the susp@@ ect and spo@@ t@@ ted him arriving at d@@ it@@ ta &apos;s house in and was seen to place the drugs which had a pur@@ ity of 60 per cent under the law@@ yer &apos;s b@@ ins in a black golf g@@ love .
soon after the drop off , scar@@ bor@@ ough was in regular phone contact with d@@ it@@ ta who had been out at the dinner at the black@@ bur@@ n ro@@ vers football sta@@ dium , e@@ wood park .
the law@@ yer returned home to discover the drugs and there were nine communications between them .
the court heard d@@ it@@ ta was a &quot; regular user &quot; of co@@ ca@@ ine after tests found trac@@ es of the class a drug in his hair , wal@@ let and on his credit cards
d@@ it@@ ta was arrested later but denied using co@@ ca@@ ine and and said he had been speaking to the susp@@ ected deal@@ er because he was his client and argu@@ ed their discussions were subject to &quot; legal privile@@ ge . &quot;
during his arrest d@@ it@@ ta pic@@ ked up his wal@@ let and tried to remove several credit cards but they were all se@@ ized and a hair sample was taken fo@@ m him .
in a police interview he said he ran an office at his home address as well as work place and clients would call at his house on legal business .
but the court heard he would call major players in the drugs supply chain , some of whom he had previously represented , after key ar@@ re@@ sts to tell them what detec@@ tives knew about them .
prosecu@@ ting , anne wh@@ y@@ te said : &quot; if anyone should know not to the break the law , it is a criminal sol@@ ic@@ itor . &quot;
mr d@@ it@@ ta is accused of ab@@ using his position as a criminal sol@@ ic@@ itor , having become too involved with specific clients .
the relationship we are talking about is not simply a drug deal@@ er , but a drug deal@@ er providing his own law@@ yer with drugs .
some of his communications will undoubtedly have been legitimate ones because he was their law@@ yer .
but this went way beyond the ordinary con@@ fin@@ es of a law@@ y@@ er-@@ client relationship .
he th@@ war@@ ted the police &apos;s investigation as much as possible to enable them to continue in their criminal activities .
mr d@@ it@@ ta was not hon@@ our@@ ing his profes@@ sion , but dis@@ hon@@ our@@ ing it .
he got too close to certain clients , in particular scar@@ bor@@ ough , and he allowed his independence to be com@@ promised .
d@@ it@@ ta denied wr@@ ong@@ doing and claimed : &quot; if i was a corru@@ pt law@@ yer , which i am not , and i wanted to feed information to mr scar@@ bor@@ ough , i would not wait 15 hours , i would do it immediately . &quot;
but after the hearing sup@@ t le@@ e hal@@ ste@@ ad from lan@@ cas@@ hire police said : &quot; mr d@@ it@@ ta turned from criminal sol@@ ic@@ itor to a criminal himself the moment he started obtaining drugs from organised crimin@@ als . &quot;
his ad@@ diction to co@@ ca@@ ine left him ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ly com@@ promised and vulnerable to the mo@@ tives of leading members of organised crime groups who t@@ asked him to obtain valuable information regarding police investigations .
sol@@ ic@@ itors should up@@ hold the highest standards of integrity and should in@@ sti@@ l trust and confidence in the public .
mr d@@ it@@ ta has be@@ tr@@ ay@@ ed this trust and attemp@@ ted to hide behind the vene@@ er of his profes@@ sion .
lan@@ cas@@ hire &apos;s serious and organised crime unit led the investigation into mr d@@ it@@ ta which has also seen him convic@@ ted of three counts of pos@@ session of co@@ ca@@ ine and now per@@ ver@@ ting the course of justice , demonstr@@ ating our commitment to bringing crimin@@ als to justice .
let this case serve as a warning to crimin@@ als that no one is beyond the reach of the law .
we will find you and put you before the courts .
scar@@ bor@@ ough himself was j@@ ail@@ ed for 14 years after ple@@ ading guil@@ ty to con@@ spir@@ acy to supply her@@ o@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and can@@ n@@ ab@@ is .
thir@@ ty five other men involved in the r@@ ack@@ et were j@@ ail@@ ed for a total of 15@@ 3 years for drugs off@@ ences .
on his website d@@ it@@ ta gave a question and answer session about himself in which he says his fant@@ as@@ y job would be a law@@ yer representing clients on death row in america , his ultimate dinner guest as being mo@@ ham@@ med ali and inequality as his mo@@ tivation for work .
revolutionary sac@@ red music factory

following the great success of the musical , &quot; rock my life &quot; , which en@@ th@@ used audi@@ ences this past spring , the li@@ e@@ der@@ k@@ ran@@ z will b@@ less two church services with the performance of fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert &apos;s deutsche mes@@ se , to close its anniversary year celebra@@ tions .
on saturday 26 october , this exceptional mass will be heard from 7.@@ 00 p.m. during the evening mass in the st. mar@@ in@@ us@@ kir@@ che dun@@ n@@ ingen and on sunday 27 october , from 10.@@ 15 , at the service in the st. joh@@ ann@@ es b@@ ap@@ ti@@ st@@ kir@@ che in l@@ ack@@ endor@@ f .
the so-called &apos; german mass &apos; , with the original title &quot; ges@@ än@@ ge z@@ ur fe@@ i@@ er des he@@ ili@@ ges op@@ fers der mes@@ se &quot; ( songs to celebrate the holy sacrif@@ ice of the mass ) , d 8@@ 72 , is a spiritual work by compos@@ er fran@@ z sch@@ u@@ bert , dating from 18@@ 26 , at at the time it was written was considered almost revolutionary .
pat@@ ron joh@@ an phili@@ p@@ p neu@@ mann has in mind for the mass to be performed as part of the church services .
under the director@@ ship of her@@ mann sch@@ nei@@ der , the cho@@ ir will be accompanied by the wind en@@ sem@@ ble of the fro@@ h@@ sin@@ n ten@@ n@@ en@@ br@@ on@@ n music society , and by no@@ em@@ i lo@@ ko@@ di on the or@@ gan .
has@@ l@@ ach : s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism vi@@ sibly gives way to confidence
the 20@@ 15 par@@ ish council elections will bring about fundamental change , for example in the has@@ l@@ ach pa@@ stor@@ al care unit ( se@@ el@@ sor@@ ge@@ ein@@ he@@ it has@@ l@@ ach , se ) .
there will then only be one joint par@@ ish council for all six par@@ ishes .
in a joint meeting on saturday , the committees from has@@ l@@ ach , ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten , m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach , fis@@ cher@@ bach , ste@@ in@@ ach and wel@@ sch@@ en@@ ste@@ in@@ ach prepared for the changes .
this is because there are no further changes to be made to the fundamental decisions of the di@@ oc@@ ese and it is up to the par@@ ish counc@@ ils to implement these in as satisfactory a manner possible .
during the course of the day one thing became particularly clear : the s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism towards the new system is re@@ luc@@ tan@@ tly yet vi@@ sibly giving way to confidence .
the extremely constructive discussions between the six committees and the full-@@ time members of the pa@@ stor@@ al care team addressed topics ranging from percep@@ tions and expectations regarding the 20@@ 15 reforms , to concrete proposals regarding the future composition and size of the par@@ ish council .
regional de@@ an geor@@ g sch@@ mit@@ t explained the newly dra@@ wn@@ -up guidelines for pa@@ stor@@ al care units in the arch@@ -@@ di@@ oc@@ ese of fre@@ i@@ burg with the help of a presentation .
according to the guidelines , the se has@@ l@@ ach , as a church community , will be a corporation under public law , which shall assume the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .
there will then only be one joint par@@ ish council and a foundation council , in which the rec@@ tor will be represented by virtu@@ e of his office .
from each par@@ ish , at least two elected members are to be represented , with so-called church community teams set up on-@@ site in the six par@@ ishes .
in future their task will be to promote church life on a local basis .
regarding the issue of the finances of the individual par@@ ishes , the need for extensive discussion became evident .
the reforms plan for the accum@@ ulated assets in the par@@ ishes to be re@@ tained for a specified purpose .
accounts pay@@ able , on the other hand , will be passed over to the &quot; church community &quot; as a whole .
in particular , planned major investments , the deb@@ ts from which thus affect all par@@ ishes , were cause for great concern .
&quot; in the past , investments were only made in projects that could be managed by the individual par@@ ishes by themselves , &quot; said has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s par@@ ish council chairman brun@@ o prin@@ z@@ bach .
bar@@ bar rit@@ ter , chair of the committee in the sch@@ ut@@ ter@@ wal@@ d-@@ ne@@ ur@@ ied pa@@ stor@@ al care unit , has practical experience of a joint committee for five par@@ ishes .
in 2006 she set her@@ self the task , &quot; become one , remain five &quot; and came to realise that the task is really not that simple .
the committees of the has@@ l@@ ach pa@@ stor@@ al care unit set out to answer questions regarding the future composition and size of the joint par@@ ish council , and the practical work of the church community teams .
the specific details will be confirmed in subsequent meetings and decided in an additional joint meeting of all six committees in the coming spring .
at the end , par@@ ish coun@@ sel@@ l@@ or michael sch@@ ö@@ ner from ste@@ in@@ ach presented the new logo of the pa@@ stor@@ al care unit , which was agreed on by a clear majority .
electricity to become more expensive in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f
the citizens of p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will have to adjust to high electricity costs .
as managing director of the municip@@ al energy company , j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as , confirmed to the s@@ ü@@ d@@ kur@@ i@@ er , families of four in p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f will be on the receiving end of a price increase of eur 70 to 90 per year .
one major reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise of the so-called eec lev@@ y from 5.@@ 27@@ 7 to 6.@@ 3 c@@ ents per kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t hour .
this lev@@ y will be res@@ et by the four operators of the large power gri@@ ds , in october of each year .
they es@@ timate the additional costs they will inc@@ ur as a result of the &quot; energy tur@@ n@@ around &quot; , which they will be able to recover by means of a lev@@ y on the price of electricity .
the p@@ ful@@ l@@ endor@@ f municip@@ al energy company forms the last link in this chain .
in its projec@@ tions , the supervisory council of the energy company even assumed a lev@@ y higher than that reported by j@@ ör@@ g-@@ ar@@ ne bi@@ as .
the specific figures must now be calculated before the municip@@ al energy c@@ mp@@ any can inform its customers of the precise price increase next week .
&quot; we are working on the as@@ sumption of an increase of 1 cent plus x , &quot; said bi@@ as , with the figure likely to be closer to 2 c@@ ents .
traffic lights permanently red : observe waiting time
sometimes a traffic light simply never turns green .
the contact loo@@ p on the road does not react , or the light itself is def@@ ec@@ tive .
what should you do - drive through on red ?
if an affected person has wa@@ ited for a sufficiently long period of time at a red light , and provided the crossing is clear , they can drive on , explained stutt@@ gar@@ t-@@ based law@@ yer r@@ al@@ f bec@@ ker in &quot; motor@@ ra@@ d &quot; ( motor@@ cycle ) magazine .
the waiting time must , however , be &quot; appropriate &quot; , which can be interpreted differently on a cas@@ e-@@ to-@@ case basis .
bec@@ ker advis@@ es that you wait at least five minutes before a fault with the traffic lights can be assumed .
anyone who drives on in spite of a red light must , however , be aware that he / she will be fully liable for any resulting accident .
anyone who wa@@ its for less than five minutes has , under certain circumstances , not wa@@ ited long enough , war@@ ned bec@@ ker , referring to a ruling of the ham@@ m higher regional court .
in the case in question , a driver ignored a light that was permanently red after around three minutes and and was held responsible for neglig@@ ently jum@@ ping a red light .
the traffic lights were actually not def@@ ec@@ tive , but rather turned green just a few minutes later .
he was spa@@ red a driving ban on account of the special circumstances - but was not spa@@ red a fine .
town council delighted with solid budget
every time discussion in town council meetings turns to the budget , may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster has good reason to sm@@ ile .
the municip@@ ality coff@@ ers in her@@ d@@ wan@@ gen@@ -@@ sch@@ ö@@ n@@ ach are well stoc@@ ked and the administration has been deb@@ t-@@ free since 2005 .
in this sense , this the 2012 budgetary year , can also be recorded as a complete success .
this became clear upon presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .
as andre@@ a ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d explained , the administrative budget came in at more than eur one million higher than originally planned , at around 7.@@ 6 million euro .
the administrative budget sur@@ plus , at around eur 1.@@ 8 million , also stood at around eur one million above projec@@ tions .
the sur@@ plus is primarily due to higher trade tax income and the local authorities &apos; contribution towards income tax .
the capital budget also stood well above the projec@@ ted values .
instead of the projec@@ ted eur 1.5 million euro , the value for last year was eur 2.5 million .
&quot; this is mainly due to the higher contribution from the administrative budget , &quot; said ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d .
because fewer investments were made in the 2012 budgetary year than planned , the reserves also came in higher .
in total , they managed to increase the general cont@@ ing@@ ency reserves by around eur 2.@@ 1 million , to a total of eur 4.@@ 9 million .
may@@ or r@@ alp@@ h ger@@ ster than@@ ked ro@@ th@@ mun@@ d and its team for the good work .
&quot; a job like this is not something you achieve over@@ night , &quot; said ger@@ ster in p@@ raise of the annual financial statement .
he and the town counc@@ ill@@ ors are clearly delighted with the good figures .
it may sound like a par@@ ado@@ x , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon work out expensive for the citizens .
in the past , a good financial situation meant that the local authorities could do away with high municip@@ al rates .
however , according to ger@@ ster , from time to time this has resulted in subsidies being reduced by the state .
there are pre@@ requi@@ sites that must be fulfilled in order to receive these subsidies from various compensation elements .
among other requirements , the towns and municip@@ alities applying for the subsidies must lev@@ y certain municip@@ al rates .
&quot; we have to address the subject of municip@@ al rates , as there are investments to be made in the coming years for which we could do with subsidies , &quot; comm@@ ented ger@@ ster regarding this matter .
n@@ ag@@ old : hu@@ go wer@@ m@@ ter - a cho@@ ir member for 60 years
having been a sing@@ er for 60 years , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter &apos;s story with the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ a male ch@@ oral society is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , during which he was cere@@ mon@@ i@@ ally hon@@ oured .
as per usual , hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter stood on the stage in the colours of his male voice cho@@ ir .
even after 60 years he still finds great pleasure from sing@@ ing with the cho@@ ir , which has achieved much more than popul@@ arity during this period .
wer@@ m@@ ter has also been active within the association , serving as a member of the committee for 28 years , among other roles .
for his commitment and loy@@ alty to the organisation , he has also received several awards : j@@ ör@@ g ko@@ hr , lay pa@@ st@@ or acting on behalf of the c@@ ä@@ c@@ ili@@ an association of rot@@ ten@@ bur@@ g-@@ stutt@@ gart , presented him with an association certificate and a letter of comm@@ end@@ ation signed by bis@@ hop ge@@ b@@ hard fü@@ r@@ st - the cho@@ ir also serves as a church cho@@ ir .
his cho@@ ir colleagues presented him with a german ch@@ oral association certificate and an eng@@ ra@@ ved pe@@ w@@ ter plate .
aside from hon@@ our@@ ing hu@@ go , the 3@@ 1st autumn festival progres@@ sed as usual : alongside the be@@ tra male voice cho@@ ir , the salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten ch@@ oral club , the ba@@ is@@ ingen ch@@ oral division and the local music society , the vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen sing@@ ers delivered a colour@@ ful bl@@ end of different ch@@ oral and song styles , which enter@@ tained the 400 or so visitors .
the vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen male voice cho@@ ir got things running with atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic songs such as &quot; im we@@ in@@ par@@ a@@ dies &quot; and &quot; lus@@ ti@@ g , i@@ hr br@@ ü@@ der &quot; .
they had also prepared a short se@@ ren@@ ade as a tribute to their hon@@ or@@ ary sing@@ er hu@@ bert wer@@ m@@ ter - wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g am@@ ade@@ us moz@@ art &apos;s &quot; bun@@ des@@ lied &quot; .
the be@@ tra male voice cho@@ ir also san@@ g classic ch@@ oral pieces such as &quot; j@@ ä@@ ger@@ wer@@ ben &quot; by ju@@ li@@ us w@@ eng@@ ert , &quot; we@@ it , we@@ it we@@ g &quot; by hu@@ bert go@@ is@@ er@@ n and the fol@@ k song &quot; wan@@ n du dur@@ ch@@ ge@@ h@@ st dur@@ ch@@ s tal &quot; .
with its mixed cho@@ ir and its ladies &apos; en@@ sem@@ ble - the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; ( imp@@ ul@@ se cho@@ ir ) , the salz@@ ste@@ t@@ ten ch@@ oral club ensured that the female quota was fulfilled at the festival .
the mixed cho@@ ir carried list@@ en@@ ers away to foreign lands with the ne@@ apo@@ lit@@ an fol@@ k@@ songs &quot; santa lu@@ cia &quot; and &quot; evi@@ va esp@@ ana &quot; by an@@ tos g@@ us , while the &quot; imp@@ ul@@ sch@@ or &quot; also dre@@ w on foreign languages : &quot; liber@@ ati@@ o &quot; and &quot; he@@ y ju@@ de &quot; were included on their programme .
the ch@@ oral division of the ba@@ is@@ ingen sports club returned to its home ground with &quot; was is@@ ch der sch@@ wo@@ b ? &quot; by h@@ ans s@@ ü@@ ss@@ mu@@ th and robert pap@@ per@@ t &apos;s &quot; bi@@ er@@ lied &quot; , while the vol@@ l@@ mar@@ ingen music society provided the crow@@ ning musical conclusion .
for children , there was a small au@@ x@@ ili@@ ary programme - &quot; om@@ a h@@ anne &quot; ( grand@@ ma h@@ anne ) , a.@@ k@@ .@@ a h@@ ann@@ el@@ ore st@@ ol@@ l@@ ste@@ im@@ er , performed a &apos; kas@@ per@@ l &apos; theater ( similar to pun@@ ch and ju@@ dy ) and read some stories , which kept the children enter@@ tained throughout the afternoon .

ken@@ y@@ an press ou@@ tr@@ aged at controversial media law
&quot; it is a fri@@ ghten@@ ing place , and it is valid to ask : what is there to prevent parliament from simply swe@@ eping away the independence of the judici@@ ary tomorrow ? &quot; the paper said , challenging the bill as un@@ constitutional .
&quot; this law is dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian and very p@@ uni@@ tive and we reject it , &quot; said cy@@ r@@ us kam@@ au , managing director for capital group - home to cap@@ ital@@ f@@ m , one of ken@@ ya &apos;s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .
he said the new media tri@@ bun@@ al &quot; will always be bi@@ ased because it &apos;s an extension of the government , &quot; and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage ken@@ ya &apos;s place in the global economy .
&quot; i hope the president will listen to us , and we appeal to him to reject this bill and return it to the m@@ ps , &quot; he said .
according to the star newspaper , the new bill will effectively hand the government &quot; a str@@ ang@@ le@@ hold over the media , &quot; while the standard said democracy and free speech in ken@@ ya had been &quot; dealt a major b@@ low &quot; and lam@@ bas@@ ted the bill as &quot; dr@@ ac@@ on@@ ian . &quot;
the passing of the bill comes am@@ id a string of measures to reinforce national security in the wake of the september &apos;s attack by islam@@ ist gun@@ men on the west@@ gate shopping m@@ all .
ken@@ ya media dre@@ w the ire of authorities by broad@@ casting security camera foot@@ age of troops who were dis@@ pat@@ ched to the scene of the attack pur@@ porte@@ dly rob@@ bing the up@@ market m@@ all .
police chief david ki@@ ma@@ i@@ y@@ o re@@ acted by sum@@ mon@@ ing two journalists and a media executive for ques@@ tioning , although the sum@@ mon@@ s was re@@ trac@@ ted following a media out@@ cr@@ y .
under the new bill , media houses can be fined up to 20 million ken@@ y@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings and individual journalists up to one million with the additional risk of being &quot; de-@@ listed , &quot; or bar@@ red from receiving official press ac@@ cred@@ itation .
the tri@@ bun@@ al also has the power to se@@ ize the property of an off@@ en@@ der if a fine is not paid .
according to the daily nation , &quot; even one fine is enough to cri@@ pp@@ le most f@@ m stations . &quot;

bad@@ -@@ d@@ ür@@ rhe@@ im : a dream comes true for the f@@ c
the official in@@ aug@@ ural cere@@ mony for the astro@@ -@@ tur@@ f sports field did not wan@@ e in significance for the town and the football club , in spite of the cold weather and rain .
everyone had hoped for more pleasant conditions for the cere@@ mony last saturday , however the weather go@@ ds chose not to cooperate .
so anyone who came without an um@@ bre@@ lla , or for whatever reason could not hold onto one , dre@@ w the short stra@@ w .
this was the case for the musicians who accompanied the cere@@ mony , as well as for a number of speakers .
thus , f@@ c chairman al@@ bre@@ cht sch@@ len@@ ker , who spoke of the ful@@ fil@@ ment of a dream , also got fairly we@@ t .
his thanks went first and foremost to may@@ or wal@@ ter k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p , who was heavily involved in the re@@ alisation of the project , the town council , the companies involved and club members who played a part .
particular mention went out to lo@@ th@@ ar held , paul we@@ iz@@ en@@ e@@ gger , he@@ iner ga@@ il and peter gra@@ f .
the sp@@ ry pen@@ sion@@ ers laid 400 square metres of flag@@ ging for the new paths .
this remarkable voluntary commitment was also hon@@ oured by member of the state parliament , kar@@ l ro@@ mb@@ ach .
further words of gre@@ e@@ ting were issued to the town sports commissioner , hu@@ bert ba@@ i@@ er , the district chair@@ person of the southern ba@@ den football association , kun@@ o k@@ ay@@ an , and fried@@ rich k@@ nor@@ r from the planning office , who announced a don@@ ation to the club &apos;s youth division .
may@@ or k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p rec@@ alled that wea@@ ther@@ -@@ related influ@@ ences in the spring and autumn had repeatedly aff@@ lic@@ ted the original sports field , to such an extent that it could not be played on .
it was way back 15 years ago that solutions to the problem were first considered , when the construction of a third pit@@ ch on the football club site or at the secondary school on sal@@ in@@ en@@ see lake were considered .
both ideas were rejected .
six years ago , thoughts turned to laying an astro@@ -@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch , which was generally viewed as the perfect solution .
specific plans were drawn up two years ago , when the f@@ c in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted the sch@@ ab@@ el@@ stu@@ be in le@@ as@@ e@@ hold , promised a contribution of eur 10@@ 0,000 for the construction of the pit@@ ch and the state approved a subsid@@ y of eur 10@@ 4@@ ,000 .
in october 2012 , the town council decided to cover the remaining eur 3@@ 5@@ 6@@ ,000 of the total cost of eur 5@@ 6@@ 0,000 , summar@@ ised k@@ lu@@ mp@@ p .
work began on the 68 x 10@@ 8 metr@@ e astro@@ -@@ tur@@ f pit@@ ch on 4 june .
during the construction phase , which las@@ ted over three months , 3@@ ,000 cu@@ b@@ ic metres of earth were removed , of which half was used for the laying of a dir@@ t bike track .
union and sp@@ d have continued their coalition negotiations , addressing the topics of internal affairs and justice .
to this end , the competent working group met this morning .
among other issues , topics discussed included direct democracy , the bri@@ ber@@ y of m@@ ps and the federal police .
during the morning , the migration and integration working group also sought to continue its discussions .
among the issues to be addressed was that of dual nation@@ ality , in which regard both sides have oppos@@ ing ideas .
the sp@@ d would like to put an end to the pressure placed on immi@@ grant children to decide on one nation@@ ality - the union re@@ jects the notion of a dual pass@@ port .
regarding the subject of traffic , which was not on the agenda for this friday , the sp@@ d substan@@ ti@@ ated its opposition to a car tol@@ l charge promoted by the c@@ su .
a tol@@ l road stic@@ ker would amount to a &quot; flat rate fee for frequent drivers and would thus be environmentally counter@@ productive , &quot; explained the sp@@ d negoti@@ ator for issues relating to traffic , fl@@ ori@@ an pron@@ old , in a letter to his parliamentary group .
there would be a threat of diver@@ ted traffic on country roads , which are already accident hot@@ spots .
the introduction of a tol@@ l for cars would also only be a first step , in pron@@ old &apos;s eyes .
&quot; there is the risk that the compensation for german@@ s would be abol@@ ished at a later point in time , &quot; he said .

it genuinely was a tropical evening in stutt@@ gart .

vienna airport abol@@ ishes passenger call@@ -@@ outs
mr. max ma@@ i@@ er , please make your way to gate 24 .
in future , announ@@ c@@ ements such as this will no longer happen at vienna international airport .
the majority of lou@@ d@@ speaker announ@@ c@@ ements will ce@@ ase - thus considerably reducing the noise level .
the goal of this adjustment is to create a more relaxing atmosphere .
as airport spo@@ kes@@ person peter kle@@ em@@ an announced to radio vienna that in adju@@ sting the approach towards announ@@ c@@ ements , vienna airport is following an international trend .
among others , the airports in k@@ op@@ enh@@ agen , frankfurt and du@@ ba@@ i have already done away with the nois@@ y call@@ -@@ outs .
by doing away with these announ@@ c@@ ements - on average around 200 personal call@@ -@@ outs come through the lou@@ d@@ speakers per day - the atmosphere in the airport should be cal@@ mer in future .
&quot; experience has also shown that these individual announ@@ c@@ ements are relatively sel@@ dom taken notice of , and at the same time , all other information regarding changes to departure gates or flight times are somewhat lost among them , &quot; said kle@@ em@@ an while ch@@ at@@ ting to the radio broad@@ cas@@ ter .

an overview of milk and eg@@ g alternatives
ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion promotes vege@@ table alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s , milk and d@@ airy products .
mas@@ hed to@@ f@@ u with plant cre@@ am , for example , serves as a substitu@@ te for quar@@ k cheese .
the vege@@ t@@ arian association will provide further examples on world ve@@ gan day on 1 november .
on the occasion of world ve@@ gan day on 1 november , the vege@@ t@@ arian association of germany will propose a host of ve@@ gan alternatives :
pure plant mar@@ gar@@ ine is a good alternative to but@@ ter , while yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can be replaced by so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t .
so@@ ya , o@@ at , al@@ mon@@ d or rice milk can be used in place of milk .
plant wh@@ i@@ pping cre@@ am can replace traditional wh@@ i@@ pping cre@@ am .
there are also plant alternatives to e@@ gg@@ s .
half a mas@@ hed , ri@@ pe ban@@ ana , for example , can replace an eg@@ g as a binding agent in a ca@@ ke .
50 gram@@ s of apple sau@@ ce or a tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ground lin@@ se@@ ed plus three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of water are also suitable .
a d@@ ough becomes flu@@ ff@@ y by replac@@ ing eg@@ g with a mix@@ ture of one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of ba@@ king pow@@ der , one tab@@ les@@ po@@ on of cor@@ n@@ fl@@ our and three tab@@ les@@ po@@ ons of min@@ eral water , for example .
50 gram@@ s of so@@ ya yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t or sil@@ ken to@@ f@@ u can also fulfil this purpose .
according to information from the vege@@ t@@ arian association , around 8@@ 00@@ ,000 german@@ s currently have a ve@@ gan di@@ et , i.e. a 100 % vege@@ table di@@ et .
sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess in new york
on the way to their host families in we@@ y@@ mouth , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts , the pu@@ pil@@ s of the sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d gram@@ mar school got to know the american city of new york .
after an eigh@@ t-@@ hour flight , they head@@ ed straight for bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n bridge , via which the heart of the city , man@@ h@@ att@@ an , can be reached on foot .
from here there is a fascinating view of the world-@@ famous sky@@ line , which is particularly impressive in the evening light .
due to the time difference , the pu@@ pil@@ s had been on the go for almost 24 hours , however , true to the s@@ log@@ an , &quot; the city never sle@@ eps &quot; , the day was roun@@ ded off with a trip to times square .
in spite of a shut@@ down , they were able to visit the stat@@ ue of liber@@ ty on the second day , and clim@@ b the stat@@ ue on foot .
they then moved on to the financial district , via wall street , to visit the 9 / 11 mem@@ orial .
on the third day , the pu@@ pil@@ s were able to take in an overview of the fascinating city from the viewing platform of the empire state building , enjoying the views from a height of 3@@ 73 metres .
they then made their way through the hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le of the new york streets , via the ro@@ ck@@ er@@ f@@ ell@@ er center , to central park , which provided the perfect opportunity to rest a while in the autumn sun .
following a short flight from new york to bo@@ ston , the pu@@ pil@@ s have now arrived with their host families and are experiencing the school day at we@@ y@@ mouth high school .
once again this year , on saint hu@@ bert &apos;s day , a hu@@ bert mass will be celebrated in the par@@ ish of st. mari@@ en on h@@ ü@@ ls@@ ber@@ g@@ stras@@ se .
st. hu@@ bert was , according to leg@@ end , a truly ru@@ th@@ less hun@@ ter , who converted following a vision and was later appointed bis@@ hop of l@@ ü@@ t@@ ti@@ ch .
hun@@ ting hor@@ n group &quot; j@@ ag@@ dre@@ i@@ ter west@@ fal@@ en &quot; , under the director@@ ship of bri@@ g@@ it@@ te k@@ lu@@ th , played old , traditional french me@@ lo@@ dies on par@@ force hor@@ ns ( natural hor@@ ns in the key of e flat ) .
the wind players wear riding clothes , as they provide musical accompan@@ im@@ ent mainly for ri@@ ders , horses and p@@ acks of h@@ ounds on dra@@ g hun@@ ts .
the sole@@ m@@ n mass is to take place on sunday 3 november at 11.@@ 30 a.m.
the newly designed op@@ sch@@ la@@ g stands out with a new café .
one that invi@@ tes you to ling@@ er a while and to come again .
one that wants to get its name out there .
according to dic@@ tion@@ aries , dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u is defined as a psycho@@ logical phenomenon , which expres@@ ses itself in the feeling of having already experienced or seen a new situation .
in the case of a visit to the café of the same name at the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve county , with a view of the rhe@@ in-@@ wa@@ al university , it doesn &apos;t always have to remain a pure dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u feeling .
ultimately , this is precisely the aim of the café with the wonderful name : to make an actual visit and something that can be repeated on a rec@@ ur@@ ring basis , not just theore@@ tically , but tan@@ gi@@ bly .
because it is fun and simply beautiful .
a gl@@ ance into the internal work@@ ings at op@@ sch@@ la@@ g 8 gives the on@@ loo@@ ker a positive feeling right from the outset .
with its ul@@ tra-@@ modern yet cosy café ambi@@ ence , it looks like a place designed to make you feel good .
the team here , with business foun@@ ders , mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ lt and dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner at the hel@@ m , spo@@ ils guests with a wide range of coff@@ e@@ es and cock@@ tails .
in addition to this , there are delicious ca@@ kes or fres@@ h@@ ly ba@@ ked bag@@ u@@ et@@ tes , filled to order .
the owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves as restaur@@ ate@@ urs prior to opening the ch@@ ic café on the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g : they previously managed the &quot; art lounge &quot; in k@@ ran@@ enburg .
by moving to kle@@ ve on the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g , the friendly café lovers hope to reach a wider audience .
not least through university customers .
&quot; we don &apos;t have a specific target group , &quot; emphasi@@ ses dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner .
in actual fact , here the pair hope to appeal as much to young students as they do to senior citizens and all age br@@ ac@@ kets .
speaking of café lovers ...
the two friendly owners are motivated by their love of coffee .
they themselves enjoy the frag@@ rant , hot bre@@ w in a vari@@ et of formats .
es@@ pres@@ so fan
dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is more of an es@@ pres@@ so fan , while mir@@ j@@ am van der ste@@ lt is the cap@@ pu@@ c@@ c@@ ino drin@@ ker .
&quot; and a bag@@ u@@ ette with it - that &apos;s my thing , &quot; she revealed to the n@@ r@@ z .
there have already been two events held in the bri@@ gh@@ tly lit café .
or perhaps more accur@@ ately , one .
this is because the ha@@ f@@ en@@ fest took place more outside than in - café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u did not benefit from it .
however , there was also the r@@ ing@@ el@@ nat@@ z evening .
the two 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds found it &quot; beautiful , successful and fun@@ ny &quot; .
but it was not for everyone .
perhaps this is why dani@@ el b@@ ü@@ tt@@ ner is not a vo@@ cal fan of evening events : &quot; you just cannot please everyone &quot; .
and with an event , i am always only appe@@ aling to those who have expressed an interest in the special event .
for this reason , events will always be an exception to the rule for us .
&quot; we want to cause as little dis@@ ru@@ ption as possible to normal business &quot; .
that is to say : dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u also stands for reliability .
this is with regard to the quality of the products that are offered here , as well as the team and the fantastic setting on the op@@ sch@@ la@@ g in kle@@ ve .
the street that is fast becoming a &apos; restaurant m@@ ile &apos; .
this is to the deli@@ ght of many kle@@ ve residents , guests from near and far and the students who are disco@@ vering the &apos; restaurant m@@ ile &apos; , and with it the café dé@@ j@@ à v@@ u , for themselves .

a day of thanks with the m@@ g@@ v ( male ch@@ oral society ) in din@@ ker
this year the &quot; fried@@ rich wil@@ hel@@ m din@@ ker &quot; m@@ g@@ v issued an invitation to its 16@@ 5th anniversary celebr@@ ation , which 52 guests , active sing@@ ers and their wi@@ ves were happy to accept .
in the clu@@ b@@ house at the &quot; wit@@ te@@ bor@@ g &quot; inn in din@@ ker , all those present enjoyed the friendly ge@@ t-@@ together in the name of music .
tradi@@ tionally , the anniversary celebr@@ ation is also always the fit@@ ting occasion to be@@ sto@@ w hon@@ ours .
this time around , secretary ro@@ l@@ f wag@@ en@@ er was delighted to receive the special &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; award .
&quot; not only have you kept countless records for us , but you have also done so much running around for us , and for this we offer our sinc@@ ere thanks , &quot; said cho@@ ir chairman er@@ ich sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
the awards for participation in the performances and cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als by means of the presentation of &quot; activity posi@@ es &quot; , this year went to cho@@ ir director di@@ e@@ ter schul@@ ze , with 44 att@@ end@@ ance marks , followed by hon@@ or@@ ary chairman hor@@ st pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , the chairman himself , and last year &apos;s &quot; sing@@ er of the year &quot; fried@@ rich win@@ k@@ ler , each having attended 42 times .
fifth place went to ar@@ tu@@ r br@@ ü@@ ck@@ ner , responsible for organis@@ ing music copies .
the board of directors gave special thanks to the team managed by in@@ n@@ ke@@ eper , ange pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert , which once again delighted those present with a top class menu , and to ger@@ da pi@@ er-@@ ri@@ b@@ bert for the table decor@@ ations .
the &quot; fried@@ rich@@ -@@ wil@@ hel@@ m &quot; m@@ g@@ v meets for its regular cho@@ ir re@@ hear@@ s@@ als in the clu@@ b@@ house every tuesday at 19 : 45 .
&quot; new vo@@ ices that love to sing are more than welcome any time , &quot; said sch@@ lo@@ t@@ mann .
un ha@@ ils new goals to tackle poverty
the united nations is to start work immediately on a new set of goals to replace the millennium development goals , which were put place 12 years ago to tackle global poverty .
austr@@ ali@@ an diplom@@ ats played a key role in pus@@ hing for &quot; sustainable development goals &quot; to replace the m@@ d@@ gs , which exp@@ ire in 20@@ 15 , ahead of the un sustainable development summit that began in rio de jan@@ e@@ iro over@@ night .
they were included in the final draft of the document , which will be endor@@ sed by world leaders including ms g@@ ill@@ ard during the summit .
un secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general ban ki@@ -@@ moon told the summit over@@ night that now is the time to &quot; rise above national interests . &quot;
&quot; i am pleased that member states have agreed to launch and take ownership of a process to establish universal sustainable development goals - sd@@ gs , &quot; he said .
these sd@@ gs will build on our adv@@ ances under the millennium development goals , and they will be an integral part of the post-@@ 20@@ 15 development framework .
i will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the m@@ d@@ gs .
even though the s@@ g achi@@ m / ba@@ den has gone four match days without victory , a positive mo@@ od is still prevail@@ ing within the top flight hand@@ ball team .
tra@@ iner tom@@ as@@ z mal@@ mon will not let there be any doubt of this fact .
everyone is still fully motivated for the task at hand .
that said , i do hope that we finally start winning again .
&quot; i no longer remember how a victory like that tas@@ tes , &quot; said mal@@ mon , anticip@@ ating success for his team at v@@ f@@ l fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k ii .
even though the third-@@ ti@@ er reserves from fre@@ den@@ bec@@ k are no &apos;t exactly in the best form at the moment , mal@@ mon has issued a warning in advance
i trained many of the players myself in the a-@@ youth .
consequently , they will be particularly motivated playing against their former co@@ ach .
&quot; in addition , we will have to wait and see whether rein@@ for@@ c@@ ements from the first team will be there , &quot; explained the s@@ g co@@ ach .
in any case , if they are to finally get back on the winning track , mal@@ mon &apos;s team will have to improve on recent performances .
there have been major problems , primarily in terms of covering and counter att@@ acking .
the team &apos;s eye for the goal must be considerably improved .
therefore , i hope that my players have finally managed to clear their heads during the short break .
moz@@ ambi@@ que security concerns mount as powerful person@@ alities cl@@ ash
with a stat@@ ue of sam@@ ora mac@@ hel , moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s founding president , star@@ ing down on them , thousands of people gathered in central ma@@ pu@@ to to ch@@ ant peace s@@ log@@ ans in a rare public demonstration .
&quot; we want peace back ; we want stability , &quot; said van@@ ess@@ a de s@@ ous@@ a , chief executive of an investment company .
fe@@ ar@@ ful about the future of her country , she sw@@ app@@ ed her corporate at@@ ti@@ re for a t-@@ shir@@ t emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with &quot; we demand security &quot; in portuguese as she joined the crow@@ ds in the capital &apos;s independence square on thursday .
for two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of cl@@ ash@@ es between government forces and ren@@ am@@ o , some of the worst sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ishes since a peace deal more than 20 years ago .
ren@@ am@@ o was once a not@@ ori@@ ous re@@ bel movement , initially backed by wh@@ ite@@ -@@ rul@@ ed r@@ ho@@ desi@@ a and then south africa &apos;s apar@@ the@@ id government as part of efforts to dest@@ ab@@ il@@ ise the country &apos;s independent government .
after a 1992 peace deal , it became an opposition party .
analy@@ sts believe the country is unlikely to sli@@ de back into full-@@ blo@@ wn conflict , but recent events have un@@ ner@@ ved foreign investors and loc@@ als .
the sta@@ kes are high for the fa@@ st-@@ growing economy as the discovery of huge off@@ shore gas reserves and coal depos@@ its in the nor@@ th@@ west could bring in more than $ 50@@ b@@ n of investment over the next few next years from companies including rio t@@ into , val@@ e of brazil , en@@ i of italy and an@@ ad@@ ar@@ ko of the us .
the ruling fre@@ lim@@ o party , the dominant political force since 197@@ 5 , and ren@@ am@@ o blame each other for the tension .
ren@@ am@@ o says the government initiated the latest cl@@ ash@@ es by laun@@ ching an attack on its members in sof@@ ala province , tradi@@ tionally a ren@@ am@@ o strong@@ hold , on october 17 .
as@@ sa@@ ults on the former re@@ be@@ ls then es@@ cal@@ ated as government forces att@@ acked ren@@ am@@ o bases and attemp@@ ted to kill af@@ on@@ so dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama , the group &apos;s leader , fer@@ nan@@ do ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a , ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s spo@@ kes@@ man , told the financial times .
the government bl@@ ames ren@@ am@@ o for tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing the cl@@ ash@@ es , acc@@ using it of att@@ acking soldiers .
president ar@@ man@@ do gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za has sought to play down concerns about inst@@ ability .
mr gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za told af@@ p , the french news agency , on wednesday that mr dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama saw himself as a &quot; lo@@ ser &quot; who wanted to use &quot; whatever remains of his forces to try to prove that he can impose on the government his own decisions . &quot;
both fre@@ lim@@ o and ren@@ am@@ o insist they want to avoid war .
but concerns have grown after mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was quo@@ ted as saying ren@@ am@@ o was aband@@ oning the 1992 peace accor@@ d .
he told the ft that he meant the agreement was no longer being respected by fre@@ lim@@ o .
&quot; our vision is to come back to negotiations , but with seri@@ ousness , &quot; mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
previous talks between the parties have done little to ease ten@@ sions fu@@ elled by a series of cl@@ ash@@ es this year .
&quot; it &apos;s two big men ( gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za and dh@@ la@@ k@@ ama ) bu@@ tting heads together , &quot; said joseph han@@ l@@ on , a lec@@ ture@@ r at the open university and moz@@ ambi@@ que expert .
neither of them are good negoti@@ ators and neither of them are prepared to make the kind of conc@@ essions that are necessary .
ren@@ am@@ o , which has been pus@@ hing for electoral reforms , had already said that it would bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t municip@@ al elections due in november .
presidential and parliamentary po@@ lls are scheduled for next year .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of an ail@@ ing movement to win conc@@ essions and financial spo@@ ils from the government .
ren@@ am@@ o &apos;s share of the vote has been dec@@ lining since 1992 , while a ne@@ wer party , the democratic movement of moz@@ ambi@@ que ( m@@ d@@ m ) which was formed by a former ren@@ am@@ o member , is expected to improve its showing at the elections .
mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a says mr gu@@ e@@ bu@@ za - who is due to step down when his second term ends next year - wants to destroy the country &apos;s democracy .
&quot; he does not want multi-@@ party democracy , he does not want transparent elections he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency , &quot; mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
it is un@@ clear how much capacity ren@@ am@@ o has , but it has carried out dis@@ rup@@ tive hit@@ -@@ and-@@ run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-@@ south highway .
most of the sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ishes have taken place in sof@@ ala province , which is several hundred kilometres north of ma@@ pu@@ to , but hosts be@@ ira , the port that min@@ ers , including rio t@@ into and val@@ e , rely on to export coal .
in june , rio suspended its use of the railway for about a week after ren@@ am@@ o threatened to attack the line .
mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a was co@@ y when asked about whether ren@@ am@@ o would repeat this threat .
ren@@ am@@ o wanted to &quot; war@@ n the international community that things were not going well in moz@@ ambi@@ que , &quot; mr ma@@ z@@ ang@@ a said .
the inst@@ ability has added to fru@@ stra@@ tions with the government , says fer@@ nan@@ do li@@ ma , head of medi@@ ac@@ o@@ op , an independent media company , with many people also concerned about corruption , the slow pace of development and a recent sp@@ ate of kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings .
&quot; people think the ones responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president , and he should be the one to find solutions for the problems , &quot; he says .
om@@ ar sul@@ tu@@ ane , a demonstr@@ ator , said people just wanted stability .
&quot; no one ca@@ res about ren@@ am@@ o and fre@@ lim@@ o , they just want peace again , they want free access to the roads , &quot; he said .
children should be taught my@@ ths and leg@@ ends as &quot; models for a way of life &quot; , author says .
tal@@ es of th@@ or could show &quot; br@@ ute strength is no match for sub@@ tle tr@@ ick@@ ery , &quot; while the ar@@ thur@@ ian leg@@ ends reve@@ al the importance of having a dream .
saying many of the my@@ ths would be &quot; far too wild , far too scand@@ al@@ ous and in some cases far too fil@@ thy to be taught in schools , &quot; cros@@ sle@@ y-@@ hol@@ land advoc@@ ated a &quot; careful selection &quot; of ag@@ e-@@ appropriate works .
&quot; i find it wonderful that in america , my@@ th and fol@@ kl@@ ore already has a part in education , &quot; he said .
i have been advoc@@ ating it as a plan for twenty years .
he added authors and teachers being &quot; over@@ tly di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic &quot; is a &quot; total swit@@ ch-@@ off &quot; for children , with messages being &quot; sub@@ limin@@ ated &quot; in enjoy@@ able stories .
cros@@ sle@@ y-@@ hol@@ land , who has translated be@@ ow@@ ul@@ f from ang@@ lo@@ -@@ sa@@ x@@ on as well as writing the pen@@ gu@@ in book of nor@@ se my@@ ths and british fol@@ k tal@@ es , said : &quot; you may well have intentions but you do better to keep them well out of sight . &quot;
perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for an adult and an adult author writing for a child is the necessity for some sense of hope .
not that everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending , but that there is an in@@ n@@ ate sense of good and evil .
and that must be sub@@ limin@@ ated ; revealed through a story rather than stated .
the old basis of showing not telling .
han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b back in fre@@ i@@ hof once again
100 years ago , he@@ in@@ rich han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b moved into his reti@@ rement home in has@@ l@@ ach , on sunday his final years in the &quot; fre@@ i@@ hof &quot; were brought to life .
the large audience was inspired by the extremely am@@ using role play .

mar@@ c@@ us z@@ ag@@ er@@ mann , serving as nar@@ r@@ ator , guided the audience through the ten different scenes , explained circumstances and provided links expla@@ ining le@@ aps from his youth to the time when he was appro@@ aching reti@@ rement .
on 22 october 19@@ 13 , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b returned home to his child@@ hood paradise , to his fre@@ i@@ hof .
it was there that the ro@@ le-@@ play began , with alo@@ is kra@@ f@@ cz@@ y@@ k sh@@ ining once again in his famous role as the town &apos;s great son .
true to style , he travell@@ ed with a two-@@ horse carri@@ age drawn by &quot; sch@@ war@@ z@@ w@@ ä@@ l@@ der fü@@ ch@@ sen &quot; ( black forest ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t horses ) owned by er@@ ich bec@@ he@@ rer from m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ bach .
not only was he received with great applause from the audience , but was also welcomed by his si@@ ster phili@@ pp@@ ine .
bil@@ ly sum@@ -@@ her@@ mann managed un@@ believ@@ ably well to place her@@ self in the role of the si@@ ster and brought the character to life amaz@@ ingly well , in terms of both her expres@@ sions and ge@@ st@@ ures .
between the individual scenes , the m@@ ü@@ h@@ len@@ b@@ ach@@ er bau@@ ern@@ k@@ ap@@ elle played appropri@@ ately selected musical pieces , thus roun@@ ding off the performance .
the honour of presenting the title of hon@@ or@@ ary citizen went to has@@ l@@ ach &apos;s may@@ or , he@@ in@@ z win@@ k@@ ler , who , together with a section of the town council , made an appearance representing the may@@ or of h@@ ü@@ t@@ ti@@ ch from back in han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b &apos;s day .
the &quot; dre@@ i@@ kö@@ ni@@ g &quot; sing@@ ers then made their own appearance , leading han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b to exc@@ la@@ im : &quot; o@@ h how beautiful , this brings child@@ hood mem@@ ories of my own time in a dre@@ i@@ kö@@ ni@@ g group back to life &quot; .
with their song , &quot; o jes@@ u@@ le@@ in &quot; , they delighted the audience in the fre@@ i@@ hof , as did the &quot; stor@@ ch@@ ent@@ ag@@ sk@@ in@@ der &quot; with their l@@ oud cri@@ es of &quot; her@@ aus , her@@ aus &quot; .
in his day , han@@ s@@ j@@ ak@@ o@@ b expressed his criticism of the institutional church , as well as his concerns regarding the exc@@ esses in the rural economy , the consequences of industri@@ alisation and the effects of the war .
he found his place of rest on his native soil , behind his ma@@ us@@ o@@ le@@ um on the brand near ho@@ f@@ ste@@ t@@ ten .
the ro@@ le-@@ play ended with the words &quot; a re@@ st@@ less spirit finally found rest and returned home fore@@ ver &quot; .
the performance received great applause and many words of p@@ raise from the audience .

the chan@@ ces of the re@@ leg@@ ated lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg bu@@ des@@ lig@@ a bas@@ ket@@ ball players remaining in the league have improved .
this is because there is to be a wild card procedure , and the nec@@ k@@ ar ri@@ es@@ en are now up against one applicant fewer .

&quot; we will not participate in the wild card process , &quot; said former national team player pas@@ cal roll@@ er , who has been putting together the concept for a professional club in the han@@ sa town since 2012 .
however , there was no si@@ gh of relief to be heard from lu@@ d@@ wi@@ gs@@ burg .
&quot; we are not concerning ourselves with the wild card process until it is certain that d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf is not receiving a licence , &quot; said bo@@ ss of the nec@@ k@@ ar ri@@ es@@ en alexander re@@ il , speaking to our paper .

snow@@ den may make further statements in russia
the former us intelligence expert , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scand@@ al from his russian asylum .
representatives of the federal prosecu@@ tor could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in person in russia .

in a small town in new ze@@ al@@ and , bur@@ t mun@@ ro is considered a lo@@ vable od@@ d@@ ball , all because he resolved to compete in a race in america with his 19@@ 20 motor@@ bike .
in spite of his heart def@@ ect , bur@@ t could not be deter@@ red from pursuing his dream .
with his savings , a few don@@ ations and a mort@@ gage on his old workshop , he set off to los angel@@ es by ship .

r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard has also invested highly in land
they stock@@ p@@ ile the coal that arri@@ ves on ships .
at the same time , the company also has other ir@@ ons in the fire at the location .
besides coal imports , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard is also active in the field of wind park logistics , among other vent@@ ures .
the co@@ als sh@@ im@@ mer black in the storage yard in front of the em@@ bank@@ ment .
here two huge blue st@@ ack@@ er and rec@@ laim@@ er machines distribute or load the co@@ als as required .
with each movement of the handling machines , a shr@@ ill warning noise r@@ ings out over the site .
&quot; the signals are for the purpose of security and are legally prescri@@ bed , &quot; said mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll , managing director of r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard in wil@@ hel@@ m@@ sha@@ ven .
unfortunately , in the event of un@@ favourable wind , they can be heard from far away - and as a result there have already been a number of complaints from people from the north of the town .
the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old said that he is taking the complaints very seriously and has therefore been in touch with those affected .
in close consultation with the authorities , we are now in a position to make the warning signals qui@@ e@@ ter by means of the implementation of technical measures .
in future he will also seek open dialogue with neighbours .
for mat@@ thi@@ as sch@@ re@@ ll has some further plans at the location .
with the construction of the lower sa@@ x@@ ony bridge , r@@ hen@@ us mid@@ g@@ ard is continuing to focus on coal exports for power stations and is one of the major powers in this sector in europe .
thanks to the mo@@ oring bas@@ in to the front of the terminal , sun@@ ken to a depth of 18@@ .@@ 5 metres , it has for some time now been possible to un@@ load ca@@ pe@@ size bul@@ k carri@@ ers here .
&quot; in terms of handling , this year we hope to break the 3 million ton@@ ne mark , &quot; said sch@@ re@@ ll .
alongside the local e@@ on power plant , the imported co@@ als also go to power plants in@@ land .
when the g@@ d@@ f-@@ su@@ e@@ z plant is added to the network , around 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year will be realistic .
the three ship un@@ lo@@ ad@@ ers on the bridge and the second transport bel@@ t could see this rise to 10 million .
bav@@ aria &apos;s bas@@ ket@@ ball players optim@@ istic in spite of first defe@@ at .
even their first defe@@ at in the euro@@ league could not cur@@ tail the huge optim@@ ism of the f@@ c bay@@ er@@ n m@@ ün@@ chen bas@@ ket@@ b@@ all@@ ers .
&quot; no-@@ one can stop us believ@@ ing that we can win , even against the best team in europe over the last two years , &quot; assess@@ ed bay@@ er@@ n co@@ ach s@@ ve@@ tis@@ la@@ v pe@@ sic following the unfortunate 8@@ 3 : 88 ( 39 : 47 ) defe@@ at to title def@@ enders olymp@@ i@@ ak@@ os pir@@ ä@@ us on thursday evening .
we have delivered a message : bas@@ ket@@ ball also exists in munich !
in their first three appear@@ ances in the european top flight , the munich team put in a good performance for long periods , but in the crucial ph@@ ases were not sufficiently focus@@ sed .
initially the guests managed to turn a 15@@ -@@ point deficit into a lead , with 13 minutes to go , before pir@@ ä@@ us was able to turn the game around once again .
&quot; we fought back incredi@@ bly well against the two-@@ time euro@@ league champi@@ ons , but then once again made care@@ less mistakes .
we are proud of our performance , but we want to win every game .
mal@@ col@@ m de@@ lan@@ ey and ni@@ had d@@ je@@ do@@ vic were the most successful stri@@ kers for the munich team , who had celebrated clear win@@ s against the italian series champi@@ ons mon@@ te@@ pas@@ chi si@@ ena , and the polish tit@@ le-@@ holders , zi@@ el@@ ona g@@ ó@@ ra , in their first two games .
ben green@@ man : the t@@ enth anniversary of the new york com@@ edy festival : the new yor@@ ker
one could argue that new york city is the birth@@ place of stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edy in america : nearly a hundred years ago , the v@@ au@@ dev@@ illi@@ an frank f@@ ay , who served as the master of cere@@ mon@@ ies at the palace theatre , on broad@@ way , started telling jo@@ kes directly to the crow@@ d , in a conver@@ sa@@ tional manner .
f@@ ay &apos;s innovation has been extended through the years , most recently by the new york com@@ edy festival .
created and over@@ seen by car@@ ol@@ ine h@@ ir@@ sch , the founder of the stan@@ du@@ p institution car@@ ol@@ ines , the festival celebra@@ tes its t@@ enth anniversary this year , with more than six@@ ty shows at small clubs and large theat@@ res .
&quot; most of these head@@ lin@@ ers appeared at car@@ ol@@ ines , and went on to greater success , to the point where they &apos;re too big to play a club , &quot; h@@ ir@@ sch said .
we built this festival as a way of continuing to work with them .
this year &apos;s event includes appear@@ ances by w@@ anda sy@@ kes , ka@@ thy gri@@ ff@@ in , and bill ma@@ her , as well as &quot; stand up for her@@ oes , &quot; an annual musi@@ c-@@ and-@@ com@@ edy benefit for military veter@@ ans , at mad@@ ison square garden , featuring , among others , bru@@ ce spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en , j@@ on ste@@ w@@ art , ro@@ ger waters , and bill cos@@ by .
as the festival has expanded , so has the world of com@@ edy .
several of the com@@ edi@@ ans participating in this year &apos;s festival came up through non@@ traditional channels , such as shows on smaller networks , like com@@ edy central , f@@ x , and spi@@ ke .
n@@ ick k@@ roll rose to pro@@ min@@ ence on a deep@@ -@@ cable sit@@ com ( f@@ x@@ x &apos;s g@@ le@@ e@@ fully ra@@ un@@ ch@@ y fant@@ as@@ y-@@ foot@@ b@@ all-@@ them@@ ed &quot; the league &quot; ) and now has his own com@@ edy central ske@@ tch show .
jen@@ ny s@@ late has been a cast member on both &quot; saturday night live &quot; and &quot; parks and recre@@ ation , &quot; though she is best known for her vir@@ al video series &quot; mar@@ cel the shell with shoes on . &quot;
both k@@ roll and s@@ late , as well as other young com@@ edi@@ ans with distinc@@ tive vo@@ ices ( the sur@@ really pes@@ si@@ mis@@ tic an@@ th@@ ony jes@@ el@@ nik , the wr@@ y , r@@ aci@@ ally focus@@ sed w. kam@@ au be@@ ll ) , are products of the decentr@@ alized world of american com@@ edy .
one of the festival &apos;s biggest dra@@ ws will be an interview : david ste@@ in@@ berg talking to lar@@ ry david .
ste@@ in@@ berg started as a stan@@ du@@ p com@@ edi@@ an but has become an accompl@@ ished television and film director , as well as an un@@ official com@@ edy hi@@ st@@ ori@@ an .
from 2005 to 2007 , he ho@@ sted a show on tv land called &quot; sit down com@@ edy with david ste@@ in@@ berg . &quot;
the meeting takes place at town hall , in the center of man@@ h@@ att@@ an .
&quot; the city is definitely in the com@@ edy d@@ na of all of lar@@ ry &apos;s work , &quot; ste@@ in@@ berg said .
he was telling me that , when he &apos;s here , sometimes he &apos;ll walk down an al@@ ley between two buildings and think to himself , he@@ y , if i lose all my money , maybe i &apos;ll live here .
iran satisfied with the nuclear negotiations process
iran has expressed satisfaction with the negotiation process , one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five un ve@@ to powers and germany .
&quot; after many years , we have now reached an agreement with the international nuclear energy authorities to clear up the differences from past years , &quot; wrote foreign minister mo@@ ham@@ med d@@ sch@@ aw@@ ad sar@@ if on his fac@@ e@@ book page .
it will without doubt be a long path , but the chief nuclear negoti@@ ator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optim@@ istic that both sides will come to a solution in the end .
dr@@ ama in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay : bo@@ ys kill play@@ m@@ ate with mac@@ he@@ tes
two children have conf@@ essed to the murder of an 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay .
the two bo@@ ys , aged 14 and 12 , had invited their victim to go bird hun@@ ting with them .
on tuesday , armed with mac@@ he@@ tes and k@@ ni@@ ves , they stab@@ bed the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old to death and thre@@ w the body into a well , reported the &quot; el pa@@ í@@ s &quot; newspaper on thursday .
they then went and played football in front of their homes in a working class district .
the body was found the following night in the village of cer@@ ro pel@@ ado , 15 kilometres to the north of the exclusive beach resort of pun@@ ta del est@@ e .
a five year-@@ old half-@@ si@@ ster of the younger off@@ en@@ der , who they took with them , was to make a statement as an ali@@ bi , st@@ ating that she was sex@@ ually as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted by the boy .
however , when the girl described the progres@@ sion of events to the police without men@@ tioning an attack against her@@ self , the two bo@@ ys conf@@ essed to the pre-@@ med@@ it@@ ated murder of the 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old .
the older of the pair ci@@ ted a ri@@ val@@ ry on the football field as the mo@@ tive .
he was provi@@ sion@@ ally taken to a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric young off@@ enders institute .
p@@ im@@ p must go to prison
the district court of con@@ stance has condemned a 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old man from st. geor@@ gen to three and a half years in prison for explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking , p@@ imp@@ ing , issu@@ ing threats and gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ d@@ ily harm .
the former german soldi@@ er who , following two tours in afghanistan , had worked as a do@@ or@@ man , made a conf@@ ession within the context of a ple@@ a-@@ bar@@ gaining procedure .
according to the conf@@ ession , on five occasions he got to know women via internet or telephone contacts , who he then sent out onto the streets against their will after a few weeks .
he bro@@ ke any resistance by means of violence and the issu@@ ing of threats .
he kept the income from women , some of whom worked for him for years .
he prevented the women from making contact with the outside world by conf@@ is@@ c@@ ating their mobile phones and si@@ m cards .
together with an accompl@@ ice , who procu@@ red the women , he brought them to various bro@@ th@@ els in the south-@@ west .
there he had them monitored to some extent , in order to control their income .
appe@@ aring before the court , the accused initially claimed that he was suffering from severe tra@@ um@@ a after colleagues serving alongside him in afghanistan had lost their lives in an explo@@ sion .
once a psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric expert had cast considerable doubt on him suffering from any psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric condition , and thus on his limited culp@@ ability , the 3@@ 3-@@ year-@@ old made a full conf@@ ession .
the court did not have to question any more of the female victims .
as an official from the criminal investigation department reported , following the first convic@@ tion achieved using telephone surveillance measures , at least four further cases of explo@@ it@@ ative human trafficking could be identified .
the inter@@ cep@@ ted conver@@ sa@@ tions were characterised by a high level of aggres@@ sion .
in subsequent hear@@ ings , the victims confirmed their or@@ deal .
a further witness , whereby one of the woman had suffered blue bru@@ ises all over her body , is yet to make a statement .
this is a case of a &quot; completely broken person@@ ality &quot; , that views the violence and exploitation in this field as normal .
yesterday the accused expressed regret for his behaviour .
&quot; i have removed myself from these cir@@ cles and hope to lead a completely normal life following my imprison@@ ment , &quot; he stated .
oil exten@@ ds drop toward $ 96 a bar@@ re@@ l
the price of oil continued to fall on friday as concerns over high supplies off@@ set a report showing china &apos;s power@@ -@@ hun@@ gr@@ y manufacturing sector is strengthening .
bench@@ mark u.s. cru@@ de for december delivery was down 14 c@@ ents at $ 9@@ 6.@@ 24 a bar@@ re@@ l by late morning in europe in electronic trading on the new york mer@@ can@@ tile exchange .
the contract fell 39 c@@ ents on thursday , leaving it down 5.@@ 8 percent for the month of october .
ample supplies of cru@@ de have weigh@@ ed on the price in recent weeks .
the energy department said wednesday that u.s. supplies increased 4.@@ 1 million bar@@ re@@ ls last week .
over five weeks , supplies have ris@@ en by more than 25 million bar@@ re@@ ls .
but a suggestion of stronger demand came friday from two reports on chinese manufacturing that showed an up@@ tic@@ k in activity .
that suggests china &apos;s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth re@@ boun@@ ded to 7.@@ 8 percent in the third quarter from a two-@@ decade low in the previous quarter .
b@@ rent cru@@ de , a bench@@ mark for international cru@@ de also used by u.s. re@@ fin@@ eries , fell 26 c@@ ents to $ 10@@ 8.@@ 58 a bar@@ re@@ l on the ice exchange in london .
court blocks ruling on ny@@ p@@ d stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k policy
a federal appe@@ als court on thursday bloc@@ ked a judge &apos;s order requiring changes to the new york police department &apos;s stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k program and removed the judge from the case .
the 2nd u.s. circuit court of appe@@ als said the decisions of judge sh@@ ira sch@@ ein@@ d@@ lin will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city .
the judge had rul@@ ed in august the city vio@@ lated the constitution in the way it carried out its program of stop@@ ping and ques@@ tioning people .
the city appe@@ aled her findings and her re@@ medi@@ al orders , including a decision to assi@@ gn a monitor to help the police department changes its policy and training program associated with it .
the appe@@ als court heard arguments tuesday on the requested stay .
the appe@@ als court said the judge needed to be removed from the case because she ran af@@ ou@@ l of the code of conduct for u.s. jud@@ ges by com@@ promising the necessity for a judge to avoid the appearance of parti@@ ality in part because of a series of media inter@@ views and public statements respon@@ ding publicly to criticism of the court .
the judge had rul@@ ed that police officers vio@@ lated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wr@@ ong@@ ly targe@@ ting black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men with its stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k program .
she appointed an outside monitor to over@@ see major changes , including reforms in policies , training and supervision , and she ordered a pilot program to test bo@@ d@@ y-@@ wor@@ n cameras in some prec@@ inc@@ ts where most stops occur .
in august , new york city agreed to end the practice of stor@@ ing the names and addresses of people whose cases are dis@@ missed after a police stop .
an oral argument on the city &apos;s appeal is scheduled for some@@ time after march 14 , 20@@ 14 .
the stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k tac@@ tic has been cri@@ tici@@ zed by a number of civil rights ad@@ voca@@ tes .
stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k has been around for decades in some form , but recorded stops increased dram@@ atically under the administration of independent may@@ or michael blo@@ om@@ berg to an all-@@ time high in 2011 of 6@@ 8@@ 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 30 , mostly of black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic men .
a law@@ suit was fil@@ ed in 2004 by four men , all minorities , and became a class action case .
sup@@ porters of changes to the ny@@ p@@ d &apos;s stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k program say the changes will end unfair practices , will mo@@ ld a more tr@@ usted and effective police force and can affect how other police departments use the policy .
oppon@@ ents say the changes would lower police mor@@ ale but not crime , waste money and not solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after shr@@ in@@ king by thousands of officers during the last decade .
the judge noted she was@@ n &apos;t putting an end to the stop@@ -@@ and-@@ fr@@ is@@ k practice , which is constitutional , but was re@@ forming the way the ny@@ p@@ d implemented its stops .
on the happ@@ iness of dre@@ aming cam@@ els
happ@@ iness is an oasis that only dre@@ aming cam@@ els manage to reach
it was with this piece of be@@ dou@@ in wis@@ dom that the first ever chairman wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g hen@@ ne described the history and fas@@ c@@ ination behind the &quot; helping hands &quot; society .
saturday evening saw the celebr@@ ation of the t@@ enth birth@@ day of the organisation , which can already look back on impressive results .
founding chairman hen@@ ne reported in depth on the work of the organisation .
in 2004 , he visited the ch@@ ei@@ j@@ k-@@ z@@ aj@@ ed hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t in maur@@ it@@ ania for the first time .
as a result , an important collaboration was developed and the gy@@ na@@ eco@@ log@@ ist , h@@ anne , has performed countless operations on several jour@@ ne@@ ys to the location .
during the speech , images from the trips were shown on a large screen , in order to give the guests at the anniversary event an insight into the initiatives mentioned .
the organisation &apos;s deser@@ t vehicle was also shown .
it is a former federal border protection vehicle .
ra@@ iner pre@@ w@@ o , the former lord may@@ or of n@@ ag@@ old , made the suggestion of equi@@ pping this vehicle with a photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system and , according to hen@@ ne , he is now planning to assume an advisory role within the organisation .
in 2008 , the sch@@ le@@ e@@ h car@@ pen@@ try company from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n built the hospital station in so@@ co@@ gi@@ m , a poor district on the edge of the capital , in the record time of less than one week - free of charge .
hen@@ ne also mentioned a new mother and child hospital in n@@ ou@@ ak@@ ch@@ ot@@ t
this is particularly interesting at a time when n@@ ag@@ old is set to do away with its mat@@ ern@@ ity clin@@ ic .
you learn a great deal working as a doctor in africa , said hen@@ ne , for example that you should slow down to avoid bur@@ n-@@ out .
due to the political un@@ rest in the country , it has not been possible to make as many jour@@ ne@@ ys as planned , but for this reason , many local doctors have come to germany , to sit in on lec@@ tures on a variety of topics .
in addition , contain@@ ers with materials are regularly sent to africa , for example in march of this year when medical devices , medicines , band@@ aging material , hospital beds and spectac@@ les were sent .
co-@@ initi@@ ator han@@ s-@@ jo@@ achi@@ m fu@@ ch@@ tel himself provided plenty of local colour , telling of mer@@ ce@@ des vehicles in maur@@ it@@ ania converted into mobile go@@ at st@@ alls and sharing the experiences of the st@@ am@@ m@@ heim musicians , who tradi@@ tionally support the organisation on their trips to maur@@ it@@ ania .
he identified his personal mo@@ tivation as being his work in the area of aud@@ iting as a young member of parliament .
when it became clear to him how much money is was@@ ted , he decided to help the afric@@ ans with controlling of their budget by the people .
fu@@ ch@@ tel also emphasised that a global economy requires global human kin@@ dness .
the fact that africa lies closer than many think should by no means be forgotten .
africa is not at all that far from gran can@@ aria .
cou@@ l@@ son used phone h@@ acking to veri@@ fy tip
former news of the world editor and@@ y cou@@ l@@ son alle@@ ge@@ dly used &quot; phone h@@ acking , surveillance and confron@@ tation &quot; in an attempt to confirm a bo@@ g@@ us tip about an aff@@ air involving th@@ en-@@ home secretary charles clar@@ ke .
prosecu@@ tor andre@@ w ed@@ is q@@ c told the old b@@ ail@@ ey that the news of the world heard a false rum@@ our in may 2005 that clar@@ ke was seeing his &quot; attractive special advis@@ er , &quot; han@@ na@@ h pa@@ w@@ l@@ by .
the newspaper t@@ asked private investig@@ ator gl@@ en@@ n mul@@ ca@@ ire with h@@ acking pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s and &quot; do@@ or-@@ ste@@ pped &quot; her , but cou@@ l@@ son also called and left her vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s , the court heard .
&quot; the prosecu@@ tion suggests that mr cou@@ l@@ son , who is now the editor of the not@@ w , he is not the man who stands outside people &apos;s houses ho@@ ping to catch them out , he is the man who li@@ kes to put the story to people to see what they will say , &quot; mr ed@@ is said .
he said the not@@ w used three ways to investigate stories : phone h@@ acking , surveillance , and confron@@ tation .
the editor is personally involved in the third .
obviously he knows about the second , surveillance , he must do .
what about the first ?
does he know about phone h@@ acking ?
he says he doesn &apos;t , we say &quot; o@@ h yes , he did &quot; .
rum@@ ours about an aff@@ air involving clar@@ ke were first pic@@ ked up by the not@@ w &apos;s features desk when a source who was sex@@ ually interested in ms pa@@ w@@ l@@ by was told : &quot; don &apos;t bo@@ ther wa@@ sting your time , she &apos;s with charles . &quot;
a tape of vo@@ ic@@ em@@ ail@@ s taken from her phone on at least three occasions was se@@ ized from mul@@ ca@@ ire &apos;s home in august 2006 .
investig@@ ators also found entries on the private investig@@ ator &apos;s computer which had ms pa@@ w@@ l@@ by and her si@@ ster as &quot; projects . &quot;
during the period she was being investig@@ ated , ms pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s grand@@ parents received anonymous calls asking for information about her , mr ed@@ is said .
meanwhile , former chief re@@ porter ne@@ ville thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and former re@@ porter james wea@@ ther@@ up over@@ saw surveillance of ms pa@@ w@@ l@@ by &apos;s movements .
leaving her a vo@@ ic@@ email on june 18 2005 , cou@@ l@@ son told her : &quot; i &apos;ve got a story that we &apos;re planning to run tomorrow that i really would like to speak to charles about . &quot;
mr ed@@ is said cou@@ l@@ son &apos;s involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men , such as former home secretary david bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t .
the jury heard on thursday that cou@@ l@@ son confron@@ ted mr bl@@ un@@ ket@@ t over an aff@@ air with a married woman while he was himself seeing co-@@ def@@ end@@ ant re@@ be@@ ka@@ h bro@@ o@@ ks , who was married at the time .
cou@@ l@@ son and bro@@ o@@ ks deny con@@ spir@@ ing with others to h@@ ack phones between october 3 2000 and august 9 2006 .
mul@@ ca@@ ire , thur@@ l@@ bec@@ k and wea@@ ther@@ up have ad@@ mitted phone h@@ acking .
in protest against the planned tax on the rich , the french football association is set to actually go through with the first strike since 197@@ 2 .
a medi@@ ation meeting comes to an end without resolution .
in the conflict regarding the tax on the weal@@ thy , the government and the professional football association in france have man@@ o@@ eu@@ v@@ red into a cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c following a failed medi@@ ation meeting .
president fran@@ ç@@ o@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de welcomed club and association representatives to paris &apos; é@@ ly@@ s@@ ée palace on thursday , where he listened to their complaints .
however , he refused to spare the football association from the planned 75 % income tax to be imposed on those ear@@ ning in excess of one million € per year , which every company in the country will have to pay for two years , from 20@@ 14 .
the opposition also remained ad@@ am@@ ant .
the strike announced for the end of november will now go ahead , informed the head of the union of professional football clubs ( uc@@ p@@ f ) , je@@ an-@@ pi@@ er@@ re lou@@ vel .
the li@@ gue 1 and li@@ gue 2 match days scheduled between 29 november and 2 december will thus be cancelled .
g@@ ech@@ ingen : absolute protection not possible
&quot; we want to involve the residents in the planning at as early a stage as possible , &quot; said may@@ or j@@ ens h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler , opening the citizen &apos;s information event regarding the flo@@ od protection concept in g@@ ech@@ ingen .
around 80 participants came to the gem@@ e@@ inde@@ hal@@ le ( community hall ) to have the planned measures explained to them , to express their concerns and submit ideas .
h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler made clear : &quot; the final decisions will be made by the members of the town council &quot; .
h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler comm@@ ented that the flo@@ od that found g@@ ech@@ ingen un@@ prepared on 15 may 2009 , was a decisive event in raising the question of protec@@ tive measures for the future .
a river bas@@ in study was commission@@ ed in collaboration with the neighbouring community of a@@ id@@ ling@@ en , which now forms the basis for the flo@@ od protection concept in g@@ ech@@ ingen .
&quot; the goal is the protection of as many developed p@@ lots of land as possible , &quot; said h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
the basis for the plans is the need for protection against expected floo@@ ds , which statis@@ tically occurs every 100 years , according to the german weather service .
climate change is taken into account in the form of an allow@@ ance of 15 per cent .
in expert cir@@ cles this is referred to as &quot; h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma &quot; .
the mass@@ es of water that caused considerable damage in g@@ ech@@ ingen in 2009 was equivalent to a 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year flo@@ od .
&quot; there is no such thing as absolute protection , but we can attempt to make a relative improvement , &quot; said h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler .
in order to achieve h@@ q 100@@ ak@@ li@@ ma protection , around four million € must be invested in g@@ ech@@ ingen , whereby the town can count on a state subsid@@ y of around 70 per cent .
however , h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler indicated that the funding would only be provided if an overall concept is developed .
in order to develop such a concept , the town is reli@@ ant on the cooperation of its citizens .
a complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .
in a best case scenario , implementation could begin in 20@@ 16 .
among other measures , the protection concept , which ( we reported ) has already been presented to the town council during the past week , plans local measures in the tribu@@ tary to the river ir@@ m , running from the st@@ am@@ m@@ heim valley .
in conjunction with the presentation of the flo@@ od protection concept , the participants made use of the opportunity to submit their concerns .
among others , the question was raised as to why em@@ bank@@ ments and de@@ tention reser@@ vo@@ irs are no longer planned to protect the location .
gre@@ g@@ or k@@ ü@@ hn , technical plan@@ ner at the commission@@ ed engineering company , h@@ ü@@ gel@@ she@@ im@@ -based &apos; wal@@ d und cor@@ be &apos; , who presented the concept , emphasised that it required the inter@@ play of all proposed measures , in order that their sum might achieve the desired goal .
furthermore , the most economic solution must be found , said jo@@ achi@@ m wal@@ d of wal@@ d und cor@@ be .
there was res@@ ent@@ ment among local residents of the old town , who have repeatedly to suffer as a result of the over@@ flow@@ ing of the canal network , even during normal th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms .
the problem is known to the administrative department and initial measures have already been taken .
however , h@@ ä@@ u@@ ß@@ ler indicated that the guidelines for canal systems are different to those for flo@@ od protection , and these must not be conf@@ used .
the town is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that it can with@@ stand ra@@ inf@@ all events every two to three years .
to make the se@@ wer@@ age channels wider would go@@ b@@ ble up millions .
persons seriously in@@ ju@@ red following col@@ li@@ sion
early on friday afternoon , two car drivers were seriously in@@ ju@@ red in a head@@ -@@ on col@@ li@@ sion on land@@ es@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 44 ( a rural road ) .
the police completely bloc@@ ked off the road immediately , but initially could not make much comment on the cause of the accident .
however , they did mention that there were various witness statements that first had to be assess@@ ed .
what is certain is that the 19@@ -@@ year-@@ old female driver of a v@@ w golf was driving in the direction of reven@@ s@@ dorf and the 3@@ 8-@@ year-@@ old man from ge@@ tt@@ or@@ f came towards her in his hy@@ un@@ da@@ i .
the two vehicles col@@ li@@ ded , whereby the woman was so se@@ ve@@ rely st@@ uck that it took the fire service almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle w@@ rec@@ k@@ age .
initially the actual cause of the accident remained un@@ clear .
both unfortunate parties were taken to nearby hospit@@ als .
the road remained fully bloc@@ ked off for around two hours .
you could call him the do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky of the usa .
phili@@ p k. dic@@ k was a god see@@ ker , a me@@ ta@@ physi@@ ci@@ an , and to a certain extent his nov@@ els and stories also feature rec@@ ur@@ ring themes .
the external li@@ ken@@ ess is ast@@ oun@@ ding : the pi@@ er@@ cing eyes , the be@@ ard , the high fore@@ head .
and so , as f@@ yo@@ d@@ or m. do@@ sto@@ ev@@ sky - with his massive o@@ eu@@ vre - is considered the reve@@ al@@ er and apo@@ log@@ ist of the russian soul , phili@@ p k. dic@@ k is considered an american pro@@ ph@@ et , who is certainly highly este@@ em@@ ed within his own native country .
some tit@@ les have been released by the he@@ y@@ ne ver@@ la@@ g publishing house , the &apos; ha@@ ff@@ man &apos;s cas@@ set@@ te &apos; featuring 1@@ 18 stories was distributed by z@@ we@@ it@@ au@@ den@@ se@@ ins .
dic@@ k illustra@@ tes america - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , pa@@ ired with par@@ an@@ o@@ ia , a fix@@ ation on security and the belief of having been chosen .
dic@@ k had &apos; god experiences &apos; , and his later books read like a mix@@ ture of the book of rev@@ el@@ ation and a computer manual .
perhaps he was cra@@ zy , or perhaps drugs had affected his brain .
he re@@ alised , early on , that computers are div@@ ini@@ ties .
he wrote a &apos; the@@ ology of the computer &apos; and ques@@ tioned what separ@@ ates humans from the machine , the cre@@ ator from the creation .
that is the &quot; bl@@ ade run@@ ner &quot; problem .
killing .
a master of science fic@@ tion .
a fantastic writer .
his stories have inspired film producers such as rid@@ ley scot@@ t , paul ver@@ ho@@ even and ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg .
the latter story is now particularly significant .
&quot; minority report &quot; origin@@ ates from the year 195@@ 6 , and ex@@ u@@ des the sc@@ ent of the cold war and the mc@@ car@@ thy tri@@ bun@@ al .
here the principle of the &quot; pre-@@ crime &quot; is developed , i.e. something that is now more or less official doc@@ tr@@ ine within the white house .
in dic@@ k &apos;s world , which is al@@ arm@@ ingly similar to our own , mu@@ t@@ ants look into the future - and the police have access to this insight .
&quot; we arrest individuals who &apos;ve broken no law , &quot; says the government official .
&quot; we get to them first , before they can commit an act of violence &quot; .
and : &quot; in our society we have no major crimes , but we do have a de@@ tention camp full of w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be crimin@@ als &quot; . they read time stre@@ ams .
they assume that bad things are going to happen and prevent the criminal thought turning into action .
dic@@ k &apos;s tal@@ e acts as a blue@@ print for the anti-@@ terror laws and the phone ta@@ pping mad@@ ness of the n@@ sa .
anticip@@ ation of attack : this is also how obama &apos;s dr@@ one philosophy and practices work .
however , dic@@ k &apos;s story is not yet finished .
the police chief argu@@ es that there is no more division of power , the military controls daily life - and what is left of the state .
then the wat@@ cher is himself being wat@@ ched and is convic@@ ted of a future crime .
the system sli@@ ps up .
it is perfect , but it lies .
it de@@ vis@@ es its own conditions .
it not only accepts errors and victims , but buil@@ ds itself on them .
the system creates the threat that it is fighting against .
to read phili@@ p k. dic@@ k means to get closer to the truth , time and time again .
issu@@ ing statements regarding the mer@@ kel sp@@ ying scand@@ al from russia
the former us intelligence expert , ed@@ ward snow@@ den , may make further statements regarding the us es@@ pi@@ on@@ age scand@@ al involving federal chancell@@ or , ang@@ ela mer@@ kel , from his russian asylum .
representatives of the german federal prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office could either submit questions in writing or meet the 30@@ -@@ year-@@ old in person in russia , reported the inter@@ fax agency .
green party parliament representative , han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le , was yesterday the first german politici@@ an to meet with snow@@ den in moscow , to discuss the scand@@ al with him .
n@@ sa rev@@ el@@ ations boost corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia about state surveillance
on a mil@@ d day in late august a german police helicop@@ ter bu@@ z@@ zed low over the us consul@@ ate in frankfurt , the financial capital of germany .
on the instruc@@ tion of the office for the protection of the constitution ( b@@ f@@ v ) , germany &apos;s domestic intelligence agency , its mission was to photo@@ graph the roof@@ top of the us out@@ post , which is located less than 5@@ km from the european central bank and bun@@ des@@ bank .
german media say the b@@ f@@ v hoped to identify the presence of listening an@@ ten@@ n@@ as and the action promp@@ ted an exchange between the us and the german foreign ministry in berlin .
james cla@@ pper , us director of national intelligence , insi@@ sted again in september that the us does not use foreign intelligence capabilities &quot; to ste@@ al the trade secre@@ ts of foreign companies on behalf of us companies to enhance their international competitiveness or increase their bottom line . &quot;
but ever since ed@@ ward snow@@ den , the contrac@@ tor turned wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , began rele@@ asing his treas@@ ure tro@@ ve of us surveillance secre@@ ts , european governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether to take the director at his word .
reports that the us national security agency spi@@ ed on braz@@ ili@@ an oil company petro@@ br@@ as and gained access to data held by us cl@@ oud providers including google and y@@ a@@ ho@@ o have rat@@ che@@ ted corporate par@@ an@@ o@@ ia about state surveillance to new high@@ s .
the final stra@@ w came when it was revealed that chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel &apos;s phone had been bu@@ gged , possibly for about a decade .
if europe &apos;s most powerful person can be targeted , then surely business leaders are also potential targets .
snow@@ den has made transparent the intensive collaboration between us intelligence services and companies .
i think it &apos;s con@@ cei@@ vable that these data are used for mutual benefit .
&quot; germany must wake up , &quot; says oli@@ ver gr@@ ü@@ n , president of bit@@ mi , which represents small and medium sized german it companies .
german companies believe the us now poses almost as big a risk as china when it comes to industrial es@@ pi@@ on@@ age and data the@@ ft , according to a survey published in july by ey , the consult@@ ancy .
in all the documentation le@@ ak@@ ed by mr snow@@ den , there has , however , been no evidence to date that the us has passed on foreign companies &apos; trade secre@@ ts to its own companies .
politicians have expressed concern that the eu l@@ acks certain it and internet capabilities and should strive to reduce its dependence on the us .
business leaders are s@@ cep@@ tical about this .
someone in the german parliament says we should build a german google .
i can only sh@@ ut my eyes and slowly open them again ...
&quot; that &apos;s not the way , &quot; has@@ so pl@@ att@@ ner , chairman of german business software company sap , says .
if one wanted a strong european it industry , then one shoul@@ dn &apos;t have let it die out 20 years ago .
everything is subsid@@ ised in germany , from coal , to cars and farmers .
everything but the it industry .
still , the reach and technical sophistic@@ ation of us sp@@ y agencies exposed by the snow@@ den rev@@ el@@ ations have come as a sho@@ ck to some companies who previously thought the biggest surveillance risk was posed by china .
a big shift is occur@@ ring in cl@@ oud compu@@ ting where european execu@@ tives have become more aware that data stored in the us is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable .
according to a survey carried out by the cl@@ oud security alliance , a trade body , some 10 per cent of non-@@ us members cancelled plans to use a us@@ -based cl@@ oud provider after rev@@ el@@ ations about the us pr@@ ism data mining programme .
j@@ im sn@@ ab@@ e , co-@@ chief executive at sap , says : &quot; we see a new question from customers that didn &apos;t come up a year ago - which is where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physi@@ cally in that jurisdiction . &quot;
many german execu@@ tives argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew : that powerful states want to ste@@ al their most pri@@ zed secre@@ ts and these data must therefore be guar@@ ded at all costs .
that economic sp@@ ying takes place is not a surprise .
it has always taken place .
&quot; this has been a topic for many years and has@@ n &apos;t fundament@@ ally changed through the current discussion , &quot; says kur@@ t bo@@ ck , chief executive of chemical maker bas@@ f .
the americans sp@@ y on us on the commercial and industrial level as we sp@@ y on them too , because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses .
corporate leaders are not generally keen to bo@@ ast about the counter@@ measures they have taken , in case this hands an advantage to an att@@ ack@@ er .
for large companies , the message has long since been dr@@ um@@ med home that pic@@ king up a free usb stick at a trade fair , or leaving a lap@@ top un@@ guar@@ ded in a hotel room are un@@ wise , to say the least .
ul@@ rich h@@ ack@@ en@@ berg , board member at car@@ maker au@@ di , says it has been standard practice for years for mobile phones to be collected before board meetings so they cannot be used as remote listening devices .
germany &apos;s b@@ f@@ v advis@@ es execu@@ tives to consider using simple prepa@@ id mobil@@ es when on foreign trips because of the risk that smart phones are com@@ promised .
the prepa@@ id mobil@@ es are then thro@@ wn away afterwards .
however , there is concern that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to h@@ acking and surveillance .
in germany , many of these companies are global market leaders in their particular nic@@ he .
&quot; small and medium sized companies often lack the experience , personnel and financial resources to protect corporate secre@@ ts effectively against un@@ authorised access , &quot; the b@@ f@@ v war@@ ns in a report .
the us war@@ ns its own companies about economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age by other countries .
the us national intelligence es@@ timate in february named france alongside russia and israel in a second ti@@ er of off@@ enders who engage in h@@ acking for economic intelligence , behind china , according to the washington post .
a board member at a german blu@@ e-@@ chi@@ p company con@@ cur@@ red that when it comes to economic es@@ pi@@ on@@ age , &quot; the french are the worst . &quot;
bern@@ ard squ@@ ar@@ cin@@ i , former head of the french internal intelligence agency d@@ cr@@ i , was quo@@ ted in an interview this month as saying : &quot; the services know perfectly well that all countries , even as they co-@@ operate in the anti@@ terrorist fight , sp@@ y on their allies . &quot;
hec@@ h@@ ingen : trade fair provides the answers to wedding questions
&quot; marriage is and remains the most important journey of discovery a person can undertake , &quot; said the philos@@ op@@ her s@@ ö@@ ren ki@@ er@@ ke@@ ga@@ ard .
tips , at least as to how the wedding celebr@@ ation can be a success , have now been given at a special trade fair in the dom@@ ä@@ ne in hec@@ h@@ ingen .

this begins with the wedding clothing .
white is a must , best mu@@ ted or in cre@@ am .
at the front , dres@@ ses with numerous ru@@ ff@@ les and em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y are in , often with a ve@@ il , while to the re@@ ar they run down the back and often end in a train .
however , opinions differ , as ste@@ f@@ ani@@ e ko@@ ch from the mode@@ haus kle@@ i@@ der@@ m@@ ü@@ ller emphasised .
for men , su@@ its with a wai@@ st@@ co@@ at and nec@@ ker@@ chief are most popular , although some people do choose cre@@ am or brown comb@@ inations .
sel@@ ecting the venue is important , it was explained .
plain ad@@ joining rooms are not ideal , the ambi@@ ence should be special .

parents of georgia teen who died in &apos; fre@@ ak accident &apos; believe son was mur@@ dered
the parents of a georgia te@@ en@@ ager , whose body was found inside a ro@@ l@@ le@@ d-@@ up w@@ re@@ st@@ ling m@@ at in his high school gym , believe their son was mur@@ dered , the family &apos;s att@@ or@@ ney said thursday .
k@@ end@@ ric@@ k jo@@ hn@@ son , of val@@ do@@ sta , ga . , was found jan . 11 st@@ uck in an u@@ pri@@ ght m@@ at pro@@ pped behind the ble@@ ach@@ ers inside his high school gym .
low@@ n@@ des county sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s investig@@ ators concluded jo@@ hn@@ son died in a fre@@ ak accident , but the 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old &apos;s family disputes that .
&quot; they absolutely think their son was mur@@ dered , &quot; ben@@ jam@@ in cr@@ um@@ p , an att@@ or@@ ney representing ken@@ ne@@ th and j@@ acqu@@ el@@ y@@ n jo@@ hn@@ son , told fo@@ x@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
they never believed he died the way the sh@@ eri@@ ff concluded .
&quot; they believe that it de@@ fies logic , the laws of physi@@ cs as well as common sense , &quot; cr@@ um@@ p said .
they think this is a co@@ ver@@ -up to protect the person or people responsible for their son &apos;s death .
&quot; they sent their son to school with a boo@@ k-@@ bag and he was returned to them in a body bag , &quot; he said .
u.s. att@@ or@@ ney michael mo@@ ore said thursday he is conduc@@ ting a formal investigation into jo@@ hn@@ son &apos;s death , no@@ ting that several key questions remain un@@ answered .
what was the cause of death ?
was his death the result of a crime ?
mo@@ ore said at a press conference thursday afternoon .
i will follow the facts wherever they lead .

c@@ dc issues children &apos;s aller@@ gy guidelines for schools
on wednesday , the centers for disease control and prevention released a set of guidelines to manage children &apos;s food aller@@ gies at school .
this is the first set of such guidelines the u.s. government has put out , as the number of scho@@ ol@@ -@@ age children suffering from food aller@@ gies clim@@ bs .
one in 20 children in the united states now have food aller@@ gies .
the c@@ dc found the pre@@ val@@ ence of food aller@@ gies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007 .
the guide contains information for schools on how to make fac@@ ul@@ ty and staff aware of children &apos;s food aller@@ gies , and how to handle them should an aller@@ gic reaction occur .
it also recomm@@ ends schools have ep@@ ine@@ phr@@ ine stoc@@ ked -- the e@@ pi@@ pen brand au@@ to-@@ injec@@ tor being most commonly used -- to respond to potentially fat@@ al an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ x@@ is .
state legis@@ lat@@ ures have recently been up@@ dating rules to allow schools to stock ep@@ ine@@ phr@@ ine more easily .
the report also includes a list of typical symp@@ t@@ oms communic@@ ated by children who are having an aller@@ gic reaction .
kids may say , &quot; it feels like something is po@@ king my ton@@ gue , &quot; &quot; my ton@@ gue feels like there is hair on it , &quot; or &quot; my ton@@ gue is t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
parents of inter@@ sex kids can pick &apos; gender un@@ determin@@ ed@@ &apos;
germany became the first european nation to recognize a third gender for bab@@ ies born with ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a .
no longer will new@@ bor@@ ns be rigi@@ dly assigned to male or female .
the new law doesn &apos;t require parents to declare any gender for such children , allowing parents to declare gender &quot; un@@ determined &quot; or &quot; un@@ specified &quot; on their birth certific@@ ates .
the aim of the law was to take the pressure off parents who might make ha@@ sty decisions on sex@@ -@@ as@@ sign@@ ment sur@@ gery for new@@ bor@@ ns , and to fight discrimination against those who are inter@@ sex .
one inter@@ sex person , according to the bb@@ c , said years later , &quot; i am neither a man nor a woman . &quot;
i will remain the pat@@ ch@@ work created by doctors , bru@@ ised and scar@@ red .
an estimated one in 2@@ ,000 children born each year is neither boy nor girl .
they are inter@@ sex , part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the diagno@@ sis of dis@@ orders of sexual development , an um@@ bre@@ lla term for those with at@@ y@@ pical ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , gon@@ ads ( ov@@ aries or te@@ s@@ tes ) , or un@@ usually developed gen@@ itali@@ a .
wall@@ is simp@@ son may have been inter@@ sex .
gender identification is still not well understood , but most experts in the united states say that when sex cannot be determined , it &apos;s better to use the best available information to assi@@ gn it then to wait and monitor the child &apos;s psycho@@ logical and physical development before undertaking sur@@ gery , if at all .
new york city psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t dr. j@@ ack dres@@ cher , who speci@@ ali@@ zes in issues of gender identification , said the new german law &quot; sounds like a good thing . &quot;
inter@@ sex children pose ethical dil@@ em@@ ma .
&quot; some people have life@@ -@@ end@@ an@@ ger@@ ing conditions that require sur@@ gery , but most kids do not , &quot; he said .
you can make a gender as@@ sign@@ ment without sur@@ gery , and then see how identity develops .
the science of knowing how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate .
nobody can answer the questions about why this happens .
it &apos;s like the myster@@ y of why people are gay .
a report fil@@ ed to the european commission in 2011 described inter@@ sex people as different from trans@@ sexual or trans@@ gender people , as their status is not gender related but instead relates to their biological ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female , but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either .
these features can mani@@ fest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics , such as mus@@ cle mass , hair distribution , bre@@ asts and stat@@ ure ; primary sexual characteristics such as re@@ productive org@@ ans and gen@@ itali@@ a ; or in ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ al structures and hor@@ mon@@ es .
the report also gives an overview of the discrimination faced by inter@@ sex and trans@@ gender people in the real@@ m of employment , as well as levels of har@@ ass@@ ment , violence and bi@@ as crimes .
gender non@@ con@@ forming bo@@ ys now have special camp .
already , australia and ne@@ pal allow adults to mark male , female or a &quot; third gender &quot; on their official documents .
in june , a 5@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an , nor@@ ri@@ e ma@@ y-@@ wel@@ by , became the world &apos;s first recognized &quot; g@@ end@@ er@@ less &quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep an &quot; un@@ specified &quot; gender status for life .
german pass@@ ports will have a third design@@ ation other than m or f -- x , for inter@@ sex , according to the interior ministry .
in neighbor@@ ing france , gender issues are still controversial , according to a news report on france 24 .
in 2011 , do@@ z@@ ens of french law@@ makers from that strongly catho@@ lic country signed a peti@@ tion for &quot; gender theory &quot; to be with@@ drawn from school tex@@ t@@ books .
the u.s. website catho@@ lic online has also opposed the german law , writing that &quot; as the world is being drag@@ ged into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , we reverse two more pill@@ ars of civili@@ zation . &quot;
one mar@@ y@@ land mother of a new@@ born also told the baby zone that she would rather see bab@@ ies assigned gender at birth .
&quot; paren@@ ting is stres@@ s@@ ful enough without extra limitations , especially if you don &apos;t know the gender of your child , &quot; she told the paren@@ ting website .
children need stability and certainty .
histor@@ ically , children born with both male and female gen@@ itali@@ a were called her@@ ma@@ ph@@ ro@@ di@@ tes , named for the hand@@ some greek god who had dual sex@@ u@@ ality .
and as little as a decade ago , the medical community thought of gender as a s@@ late that could be er@@ ased and then re@@ drawn .
but now , many are challenging the ethical basis of sur@@ gery , knowing that gender identity is complex , and doctors can sometimes get it wrong , not knowing how a child will feel about their gender as@@ sign@@ ment when they grow up .
&quot; back in the middle of the 20th century , it was called a &apos; psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ric emergency , &apos; &quot; said dres@@ cher .
when these kids were born , you didn &apos;t call the psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ris@@ t , you called a sur@@ ge@@ on .
the prevail@@ ing theory on how to treat children with ambigu@@ ous gen@@ itali@@ a was put forward by dr. john money at joh@@ ns ho@@ p@@ k@@ ins university , who held that gender was mal@@ le@@ able .
he co@@ ined the term &quot; gender identity &quot; and argu@@ ed that social and environmental cu@@ es -- how parents raised a child -- inter@@ acted with a child &apos;s gen@@ es and hor@@ mon@@ es to shape whether the person identified as male or female .
but in one 196@@ 6 case , known as &quot; john / jo@@ an , &quot; his the@@ ories became controversial .
he advis@@ ed the parents of a boy whose pen@@ is had been se@@ vered in a bot@@ ched circum@@ ci@@ sion to have the child fully ca@@ stra@@ ted , removing his te@@ stic@@ les , as well , and to raise him as a girl .
&quot; money presented the case as a successful case of transition , but it was not , &quot; said dres@@ cher .
when the boy was around 15 , he transi@@ tioned back to a boy and married a woman .
but at 38 , he committed su@@ ici@@ de .
dres@@ cher said that now some doctors are still &quot; practic@@ ing that model . &quot;
but in the 199@@ 0s , with the adv@@ ent of the internet , survi@@ v@@ ors of these gender sur@@ ger@@ ies have come forward &quot; not happy with the outcome . &quot;
such was the case with j@@ im bru@@ ce , a 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old writer from mon@@ tan@@ a , who was born with x@@ y male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es but ambigu@@ ous gen@@ it@@ als .
doctors cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t be sure if he had a large cl@@ it@@ or@@ is or a small pen@@ is and were convinced he could never live a &quot; satisfactory life &quot; as a man .
so shortly after his birth in 197@@ 6 , bru@@ ce &apos;s external or@@ gan and te@@ s@@ tes were sur@@ g@@ ically removed and he was raised as a girl .
he was given female hor@@ mon@@ es at age 12 .
&quot; i knew that i was@@ n &apos;t a girl , &quot; he told ab@@ c@@ new@@ s.@@ com@@ .
i was un@@ happy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .
at 18 , he was set for a v@@ ag@@ in@@ op@@ la@@ sty .
but de@@ pressed and knowing something was wrong , he demanded medical records .
what he found out was hor@@ ri@@ fying .
i was ster@@ ili@@ zed at birth -- and no one ever told me .
bru@@ ce was born with a ds@@ d that prevented his body from producing enough te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one to properly develop his gen@@ it@@ als .
after learning the truth , he changed back to a man , taking te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one sho@@ ts and having his bre@@ asts removed .
sur@@ gery ren@@ dered him inf@@ er@@ tile .
today , he ad@@ voca@@ tes for others in an organization called the interface project , trying to norm@@ alize percep@@ tions of those who are inter@@ sex .
but anne tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis , executive director for califor@@ ni@@ a-@@ based legal group ad@@ voca@@ tes for informed choice , wor@@ ries that the german law &quot; invi@@ tes lab@@ eling and sti@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; a lot of activi@@ sts are concerned that what the german rule will do is encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child an &apos; un@@ determined , &apos; &quot; she said .
we are afraid it will encourage intervention .
we think a better process is as@@ signing male or female sex , then waiting .
but we haven &apos;t seen how the law will play out , so all we can do is spec@@ ulate .
tam@@ ar@@ -@@ mat@@ tis said that her organization supports the austr@@ ali@@ an law because &quot; it allows adults to choose to be recognized in a third gender . &quot;
&quot; adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender , &quot; she said .
german law is about as@@ signing it at birth .
that is not a battle young children should have to take up at this point .
when they are grown , they can make decisions about their own bodies .
but dr. ar@@ len@@ e bar@@ at@@ z , a pit@@ ts@@ burgh bre@@ ast radio@@ log@@ ist who has a daughter with a dis@@ order of sexual development and helps hundreds of others in a support group , said the german law will &quot; em@@ power &quot; both parents and children .
bar@@ at@@ z &apos;s daughter k@@ ati@@ e was born with male ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ som@@ es , but has a ds@@ d called complete and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ dro@@ me .
because her and@@ ro@@ gen recep@@ tors are fa@@ ul@@ ty , k@@ ati@@ e developed female characteristics .
she has a v@@ ag@@ ina , but no u@@ ter@@ us or ov@@ aries .
now at 29 , k@@ ati@@ e is married and at the university of pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania , a resid@@ ent in child psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry .
though she is inf@@ er@@ tile , she hopes to become a parent through adoption or ge@@ sta@@ tional sur@@ ro@@ g@@ acy .
&quot; the law gives parents some space not to have to rus@@ h into making decisions themselves , &quot; said bar@@ at@@ z .
it gives them the time to do some tests and figure it out and a period of time before they write &apos; male &apos; or &apos; female . &apos; 
this way , you are ok -- raise the child , love the child .
you have a wonderful baby and enjoy the fun .
we don &apos;t have to rus@@ h into sur@@ gery that is ir@@ rever@@ sible .
&quot; it brings the children into the decision and takes away the an@@ xi@@ ety that motiv@@ ates parents because they don &apos;t feel they are doing the right thing , &quot; she said .
ultimately , the child will decide which sex he or she feels more comfortable with -- and that &apos;s a wonderful thing .
it em@@ powers children to make the decision for themselves .
unknown att@@ ack@@ ers in@@ j@@ ure girl with sho@@ ts fi@@ red from car
unknown att@@ ack@@ ers have in@@ ju@@ red a twel@@ ve-@@ year-@@ old girl in sa@@ x@@ on@@ y-@@ an@@ hal@@ t when fir@@ ing sho@@ ts from a car .
the as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants fi@@ red on a group of children on thursday evening in gen@@ th@@ in , pre@@ sum@@ ably with an air gun .
this was announced by the police in burg .
the girl suffered minor in@@ jury to her left cal@@ f .
rescue workers took the girl to the hospital .
the sho@@ ts came from a small car , which dro@@ ve past a group of six children and suddenly stopped .
wit@@ nesses saw two people sitting in the car .
the as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants also fi@@ red sho@@ ts at a bus stop .
a pan@@ e of glass was sh@@ at@@ tered .
they then dro@@ ve away .
the criminal investigation department is investig@@ ating the matter , it was stated on friday .
thus far , the k@@ emp@@ ten police department can look back on a calm hal@@ lo@@ ween night .
the authorities were only called out twice to deal with children thro@@ wing e@@ gg@@ s against houses .
because the home owners re@@ alised this immediately , the eg@@ g rem@@ n@@ ants could be clean@@ ed off at once , meaning that no material damage occurred .
furthermore , in the town centre area , while a few fire@@ works were set off , no material damage was caused here either .
the residents of the bis@@ ch@@ of-@@ fre@@ un@@ dor@@ fer@@ -@@ we@@ g reported that a car was wra@@ pped in toilet paper and its wheel tri@@ ms sto@@ len .
however , the man found all his wheel tri@@ ms nearby prior to the police arriving , on account of which no further police involvement was required .
living with a fu@@ ture@@ -@@ oriented perspective
if truth be told , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries , lives a dre@@ am@@ y life .
her house is located in a peaceful neighbourhood in stutt@@ gart , with plenty of gre@@ enery , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .
she is only a few minutes from the city centre using public transport .
&quot; hopefully you are@@ n &apos;t afraid of sp@@ id@@ ers ? &quot; as@@ ks wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries , poin@@ ting out a large spi@@ der on the door frame .
i have been looking for a new home for my hus@@ band and myself for some time now .
but you know how difficult that is in stutt@@ gart .
however , the reason for the desire to move is not ar@@ ach@@ no@@ pho@@ bia , but rather the fear of not being able to manage the large number of steps up to their house , and inside their home in their old age , she explained .
furthermore : since under@@ going a men@@ is@@ c@@ us operation , the lady , in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties , has had to experience for her@@ self what it means to move from floor to floor with a dis@@ ability .
only recently , she released a book on the subject of &quot; living happ@@ ily in old age - which type of property is the best for me ? &quot; .
&quot; our home is the best example of a property that simply doesn &apos;t work in old age , &quot; she begins to re@@ count .
when she moved to the ma@@ is@@ on@@ ette with her hus@@ band 20 years ago , it was simply just a pretty apartment in green surroundings .
now , in her mid-@@ fif@@ ties , wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries has different thoughts about it .
however , she is aware that she is one of the few people to actually deal with the topic of &apos; living in old age &apos; .
the majority of people put it to the back of their minds for as long as possible .
only other people get old , she says , sm@@ ir@@ king .
only when the psycho@@ logical stra@@ in becomes severe do people give it consideration .
&quot; but at this stage it can be too late , &quot; said ries .
in her book , the interior decor@@ ator presents 17 housing models for independent living in old age .
&quot; however , which type of residence you choose is always a personal decision , &quot; she explains .
there is no solution to over@@ coming old age .
even if you can afford to spend your reti@@ rement in tus@@ c@@ any or brit@@ t@@ any , you should always take the fact that you may become ill into consideration .
and : &apos; without a sound knowledge of the local language , you can even become lon@@ ely when living the dol@@ ce vit@@ a , &apos; added the author , providing food for thought for those seeking to move abroad .
her models include classic care models , alternative living arrangements and the of@@ ten@@ -@@ mentioned pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; living community .
in old age everyone has their qu@@ ir@@ ks and tic@@ ks .
&apos;@@ however , this type of residential community would not be for me , &apos; she comm@@ ented with a win@@ k .
definitely nothing like student accommodation with a shared bathroom and kitchen .
&apos;@@ in old age you simply need your own space to withdraw to , &apos; said ries .
however , the author does not wish to rule out the possibility that a pen@@ sion@@ ers &apos; residential community can work .
however , it must operate differently to the classic student dig@@ s .
and sometimes you also just want your peace and quiet , &apos; she believes .
with this opinion she is at least not alone in the state capital .
the experience of the@@ res@@ a r@@ ü@@ t@@ ten , head of the citizen &apos;s life in old age service in the state capital , is also that &apos; the majority of old people in stutt@@ gart want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible &apos; .
her agency agency advis@@ es people on the topic of &apos; growing old &apos; .
therefore the experience of the sti@@ f@@ tun@@ g wa@@ ren@@ test consumer study is also that elderly people in particular would accept in@@ conveni@@ ences and limitations just to be able to remain in their usual environment .
nowadays there are many possibilities for design@@ ing the house or apartment in such a way as to be barri@@ er-@@ free .
ries recomm@@ ends that all those working on the ag@@ e-@@ appropriate renov@@ ation of their house or apartment first seek out in-@@ depth information and don &apos;t simply use the first trad@@ es@@ man that comes along .
nowadays there are specialists in renov@@ ation to suit the needs of the elderly .
even in the case of rental apartments some land@@ lor@@ ds can have this work carried out , even if it is just a matter of raising the level of the toilet seat , clari@@ fied the interior designer .
however , it is not always the case that your existing apartment can be made ag@@ e-@@ appropriate and therefore barri@@ er-@@ free , even if it is as beautiful as ever .
wal@@ tr@@ au@@ d ries had to go through this experience her@@ self .
you could of course install a sta@@ ir lift inside the apartment , but the co@@ bb@@ led path up to the door of the apartment , featuring a number of steps would be a much greater hin@@ dr@@ ance .
she will keep looking until she has found the ideal property for her@@ self and her hus@@ band .
she is more afraid of the move than of the spi@@ der on her front door .
the usa still want to prosecu@@ te snow@@ den
the usa have not changed their position regarding the former us secret service employee ed@@ ward snow@@ den .
he is still accused of passing on secret information without authorisation .
he must therefore face criminal proceedings in the usa , said the spo@@ kes@@ person for the us foreign office , j@@ enni@@ fer p@@ sa@@ ki , in washington .
even the most recent statements from snow@@ den will not change this fact .
following a recent meeting with snow@@ den in moscow , german green party politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le appe@@ aled to the usa not to continue to thre@@ aten him with prosecu@@ tion .
p@@ sa@@ ki emphasised that str@@ ö@@ be@@ le &apos;s comments were the views of a parliam@@ ent@@ arian , and not those of a german government member .
secret service wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower , ed@@ ward snow@@ den is , in principle , willing to hold a discussion with the german authorities .
however , he first wishes for his situation to be clari@@ fied .
this was made clear by the former n@@ sa employee , currently sought by the usa , in an open letter that green party politici@@ an han@@ s-@@ christian str@@ ö@@ be@@ le made public on friday following a meeting with snow@@ den , and passed on to the federal government , the federal parliament and the federal public prosecu@@ tor general .
the letter was pur@@ ported to have been wor@@ ded as follows :
to whom it may concern ,
i have been invited to write to you regarding your investigation of mass surveillance .
i am ed@@ ward joseph snow@@ den , form@@ erly employed through contracts or direct hire as a technical expert for the united states national security agency , and defense intelligence agency .
in the course of my service to these organizations , i believe i witn@@ essed syste@@ mic violations of law by my government that created a moral duty to act .
as a result of reporting these concerns , i have faced a severe and sustained campaign of persecu@@ tion that forced me from my family and home .
i am currently living in ex@@ ile under a grant of temporary asylum in the russian federation in accordance with international law .
i am hear@@ ten@@ ed by the response to my act of political expression , in both the united states and beyond .
citizens around the world as well as high officials - including in the united states - have jud@@ ged the rev@@ el@@ ation of an un@@ accoun@@ table system of per@@ va@@ sive surveillance to be a public service .
these sp@@ ying rev@@ el@@ ations have resulted in the proposal of many new laws and policies to address form@@ erly conce@@ aled ab@@ uses of the public trust .
the benefits to society of this growing knowledge are becoming increasingly clear at the same time that claimed risks are being shown to have been mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ated .
though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstr@@ ably positive , my government continues to treat dis@@ sent as def@@ ection , and seeks to crimin@@ alize political speech with fel@@ ony charges that provide no defence .
however , speaking the truth is not a crime .
i am confident that with the support of the international community , the government of the united states will aband@@ on this harmful behaviour .
i hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved , i will be able to cooperate in the responsible finding of facts regarding reports in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authentic@@ ity of documents , as appropriate and in accordance with the law .
i look forward to speaking with you in your country when the situation is resolved , and thank you for your efforts in up@@ holding the international laws that protect us all .

report : obama campaign considered dumping bi@@ den for h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton
president bar@@ ack obama &apos;s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers secre@@ tly considered replac@@ ing vice president jo@@ e bi@@ den with h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton on the 2012 ticket , according to the new york times .
the rev@@ el@@ ation is the most no@@ table bom@@ b@@ shell from mark hal@@ per@@ in and john he@@ il@@ em@@ ann &apos;s heavily anticip@@ ated 2012 campaign t@@ ome , &quot; double down : game change 2012 . &quot;
the times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported thursday evening that the president &apos;s top ai@@ des conducted &quot; extensive grou@@ p-@@ sessions and po@@ ll@@ ing in late 2011 &quot; to gau@@ ge whether the dumping bi@@ den could help bol@@ ster obama &apos;s wan@@ ing re-@@ election hopes .
according to the times &apos; national political correspon@@ dent jon@@ a@@ than martin , the book provides a thorough account of the effort by senior officials inside the campaign and the white house , namely former white house chief of staff bill dal@@ ey , to measure what effect sw@@ app@@ ing former secretary of state clin@@ ton for the vice president would have in the po@@ lls .
the potential switch was a closely guar@@ ded secret within the chic@@ ago campaign infrastructure and inside the o@@ val office .
only half a do@@ zen of the president &apos;s clo@@ s@@ est advis@@ ers -- including dal@@ ey , former obama campaign chief j@@ im mess@@ ina , and former white house senior advis@@ ers david ax@@ el@@ ro@@ d and david pl@@ ou@@ ff@@ e -- knew the change was under consideration .
&quot; double down &quot; claims dal@@ ey spe@@ ar@@ head@@ ed the effort to replace bi@@ den , despite their &quot; close personal rap@@ port , &quot; before ultimately deci@@ ding against the move when their data showed adding clin@@ ton to the ticket w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t &quot; materi@@ ally improve obama &apos;s od@@ ds . &quot;
in an interview with martin , dal@@ ey confirmed that the administration did in fact consider replac@@ ing bi@@ den with clin@@ ton .
&quot; i was vo@@ cal about looking into a whole bun@@ ch of things , and this was one of them , &quot; dal@@ ey told the paper .
you have to remember , at that point the president was in aw@@ ful shape , so we were like , &quot; holy christ , what do we do ? &quot;
while dal@@ ey characterized the research as &quot; due d@@ ili@@ gence , &quot; martin told c@@ n@@ n &apos;s an@@ der@@ son co@@ op@@ er that the re-@@ election campaign made a significant investment in finding out whether the move would pay divi@@ den@@ ds at the po@@ lls .
&quot; campaigns don &apos;t spend the kind of money on po@@ ll@@ ing and focus groups unless they &apos;re seriously considering something , &quot; martin said on ac@@ 3@@ 60 .
it &apos;s un@@ clear , however , whether obama knew his team was exploring the s@@ wa@@ p .
martin told c@@ n@@ n that he asked dal@@ ey whether his th@@ en-@@ bo@@ ss knew about the potential shu@@ ff@@ le .
while dal@@ ey said he doesn &apos;t think the president &quot; was aware &quot; of the potential change , the former chief of staff ad@@ mitted that it &apos;s &quot; possible &quot; obama knew .
martin added that &quot; double down &quot; does not defini@@ tively answer whether the political prob@@ ing reached obama &apos;s desk .
co@@ op@@ er asked martin whether he seriously thought obama did not know about the research into dumping bi@@ den from the ticket .
&quot; possibly , &quot; martin rep@@ lied .
what happens with my e-mail when in transit ?
e-mail is short for electronic mail .
are there technical measures to maintain privacy of correspon@@ dence , similar to that of the traditional postal service , implemented into the design of this inter@@ net@@ -based service ?
when design@@ ing the early internet services , the focus lay on making communication possible .
thus , when developing the underlying technical proto@@ col@@ s , no attention was given to creating a stable foundation for the inter@@ cep@@ tion-@@ proof exchange of mail .
for this reason , a traditional email is more like an open post@@ card than a se@@ aled letter .
when user &quot; anna &quot; sen@@ ds an email to &quot; ben@@ ni &quot; , are the pair &apos;s computers then directly connected ?
anna &apos;s email program or browser first sen@@ ds the mail to her service provider &apos;s mail server .
if she has a g@@ mail account , for example , this would be google .
this mail server sen@@ ds the content to the provider that ben@@ ni uses .
en route , the mail can pass through any number of other servers on the internet .
ben@@ ni can then call up the content from his provider .
are traditional e-@@ ma@@ ils read by third parties on their journey through the net ?
the majority of e-@@ ma@@ ils are read several times by software robo@@ ts en route to the recipi@@ ent .
checks are generally carried out by the sen@@ der &apos;s provider as to whether the mail contains mal@@ ware as an att@@ ach@@ ment .
a virus check is also carried out on the recipi@@ ent systems .
in addition , the providers check whether it is nu@@ is@@ ance or un@@ wanted sp@@ am mail , which are deleted immediately or at least sor@@ ted into a sp@@ am folder .
do the robo@@ ts have other tasks ?
in the case of systems such as g@@ mail , the robo@@ ts also identify the information that google requires for dis@@ playing contex@@ t-@@ based advertising .
if anna and ben@@ ni communicate about their upcoming holiday trav@@ els via g@@ mail , google can display corresponding links to holiday offers .
do unknown individuals also read the e-@@ ma@@ ils ?
the prob@@ ability of un@@ authorised persons reading a mail is extremely low .
however , theore@@ tically , it is possible .
within companies , administr@@ ators are often able to read electronic mail that is sent .
law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal authorisation to inter@@ cep@@ t or take note of e-@@ ma@@ ils .
this may include potential illegal sp@@ ying activities .
is it possible to protect e-@@ ma@@ ils against being read ?
with an encry@@ ption using the open@@ p@@ g@@ p standard , an e-mail can be effectively protected against being read .
with great technical effort , it is also possible to conce@@ al the met@@ ad@@ ata of email communication so that it is not even possible to tell who is communic@@ ating with whom .
how important are y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google within the e-mail market in germany ?
according to a study conducted by con@@ vi@@ os consulting in august 2013 , among the main mail services in private use , y@@ a@@ ho@@ o and google play only a minor role .
while the number of y@@ a@@ ho@@ o mail accounts has fallen recently , google &apos;s g@@ mail managed to grow considerably .
mother bur@@ ied in sh@@ allow forest grave and pension sto@@ len
when his elderly mother died , a man from wol@@ f@@ sburg de@@ vised a plan .
he bur@@ ied the dec@@ eas@@ ed in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
according to police investigations , a 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old wol@@ f@@ sburg resid@@ ent bur@@ ied his dead mother in the woods in order that he might continue to collect her pension and care allow@@ ance .
he first covered up the death of the 8@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old and then po@@ c@@ ke@@ ted the money for more than a year and a half .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old must now face charges of fraud , said a spo@@ kes@@ person on friday .
according to the statement , the man hi@@ d the woman in a forest near hel@@ m@@ ste@@ dt .
the man was already under susp@@ ici@@ on back in may : at that time the fact that medic@@ ations for his care@@ -@@ reli@@ ant mother were no longer required dre@@ w susp@@ ici@@ on .
the pen@@ sion@@ er told investig@@ ators that his mother had travell@@ ed to spain .
the officials found this strange and so continued to investigate .
it was discovered that the mother and son had lived in the same residence for more than 15 years and that he had ca@@ red for her in her final days .
the 6@@ 7-@@ year-@@ old finally acknowledged the death of his mother .
according to police , an au@@ top@@ sy showed no evidence of any capital off@@ ence .
f@@ ancy a g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cre@@ am ?
a british entreprene@@ ur has created the world &apos;s first g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ice cre@@ am - using j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
char@@ lie franc@@ is has har@@ n@@ essed the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of the marine animal to develop the lu@@ min@@ es@@ cent sn@@ ack .
he came up with the idea after reading a research paper on j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and convinced scientists in china to chem@@ ically recre@@ ate the g@@ low@@ ing prote@@ in .
the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with the ea@@ ter &apos;s ton@@ gue - raising the ph level in the prote@@ in and making it g@@ low .
chr@@ is says because the ice cre@@ am lights up when it re@@ acts with the heat of the mouth it means the more you lic@@ k , the bri@@ ghter it becomes .
char@@ lie , founder of the &quot; lic@@ k me i &apos;m delicious &quot; ice cre@@ am company , said : &quot; it is incredible stuff but still at very early days in terms of production , so £ 200 gets you about 2@@ g of the stuff . &quot;
the prote@@ in we are using in the ice cre@@ am re@@ acts with your ton@@ gue at neutral ph .
so as your mouth war@@ ms up the prote@@ in it will raise the ph level and the ice cre@@ am will g@@ low .
we have been testing it out over the past few months and it seemed perfect to share it over hal@@ lo@@ ween because it gives that wonderful g@@ low effect .
it is probably the most expensive ice cre@@ am i have made because the j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish lu@@ min@@ esc@@ ence is four times more expensive than gold .
so each s@@ coo@@ p costs me around £ 1@@ 40 .
it tas@@ tes pretty good though .
char@@ lie &apos;s experim@@ ental company , based in bri@@ st@@ ol , is fam@@ ed for its unusual flav@@ ours including beer , cheese , beef and gold lea@@ f .
but his next creation is set to be even more ambitious .
he said : &quot; i really want to develop an invi@@ sible ice cre@@ am . &quot;
it is in@@ he@@ ren@@ tly impossible because of the re@@ fr@@ action caused by the ice cryst@@ als which make up the ice cre@@ am , but i rec@@ kon we will find a way of doing it .
the ice cre@@ am har@@ nesses the flu@@ o@@ res@@ cent properties of a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish , syn@@ the@@ sized by chinese scientists

for this match he finally has his complete squ@@ ad available , with the exception of h@@ end@@ ric@@ k blo@@ h@@ me who is out with long-term in@@ jury .
like us , da@@ ver@@ den place emphasis on high temp@@ o play .
for this reason , we must keep our errors to a minimum .
however , the top priority is to improve our cover play , which has recently left much to be desired .
da@@ ver@@ den &apos;s co@@ ach thomas pan@@ it@@ z comes across as much more relaxed following his team &apos;s first victory of the season against n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n .
the match was of course a indication of what we are capable of .
however , it by no means makes us fav@@ ou@@ ri@@ tes , as anything can happen in the der@@ by .
nonetheless , pan@@ it@@ z is now looking to come up with the goods in mor@@ sum and thus start a winning stre@@ ak .
jan@@ -@@ mal@@ te jo@@ d@@ at will not be playing .

hal@@ lo@@ ween 2013 : by the numbers
when i was little , hal@@ lo@@ ween was mag@@ ical .
my si@@ ster and i were allowed to eat c@@ and@@ y , stay up late and play dres@@ s-@@ up for the neighbor@@ hood .
nowadays , i &apos;ve become more of a sc@@ roo@@ ge .
i haven &apos;t signed up for the past two years to give out c@@ and@@ y in my apartment and probably won &apos;t this year .
but st@@ ats show that i &apos;m a black she@@ ep when it comes to hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the majority of americans - 15@@ 8 million of them in fact - will be celebr@@ ating hal@@ lo@@ ween this year , spending a total of $ 6.@@ 9 billion on c@@ and@@ y , cost@@ umes and decor@@ ations , according to the national retail federation .
one thing i do look forward to every hal@@ lo@@ ween are the trends .
cost@@ umes are expected to account for $ 1.@@ 2 billion dollars out of the $ 6.@@ 9 billion spent , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
this year , sex@@ y in@@ anim@@ ate objects are all the r@@ age .
women don &apos;t have to be sex@@ y professionals any@@ more ; they can also be sex@@ y foods like piz@@ za , ham@@ bur@@ gers and car@@ ro@@ ts .
as for men , i expect we will be seeing a lot of z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , thanks to the walking dead and i &apos;ll bet the d@@ af@@ t pun@@ k space men will make it into our inst@@ ag@@ ram fe@@ eds this year .
according to google , the highest sear@@ ched cost@@ umes are z@@ om@@ b@@ ies , bat@@ man , pi@@ rates and wit@@ ches .
i gu@@ ess there &apos;s nothing wrong with going traditional .
we dres@@ sed our dogs up last year and to my amaz@@ ement we were not alone .
in fact , americans will spend $ 3@@ 30 million on pet cost@@ umes this year , according to the n@@ r@@ f .
that &apos;s a lot of ir@@ onic hot@@ dog dogs .
when it comes to c@@ and@@ y , we don &apos;t scre@@ w around .
americans will spend $ 1.@@ 9 billion on it this year , according to the ni@@ el@@ sen company .
that &apos;s around 600 million p@@ ounds worth of her@@ sh@@ ey bars , lo@@ l@@ li@@ po@@ ps , milk du@@ ds , t@@ wi@@ zz@@ lers and clar@@ k bars .
that &apos;s great news for the 41 million tr@@ ick@@ -@@ or-@@ treat@@ ers set to take over our neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , according to the u.s. commerce department .
in fact , we will buy and , who are we kid@@ ding , con@@ sume 90 million p@@ ounds of chocolate during hal@@ lo@@ ween .
the one thing we don &apos;t want to con@@ sume , c@@ and@@ y cor@@ n ; and yet nearly 35 million p@@ ounds of it are sold around hal@@ lo@@ ween , according to the national conf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ers association .
that &apos;s about 9 billion individual ker@@ nels of cor@@ n .
it &apos;s a myster@@ y i have yet to solve .
nothing is more qu@@ inte@@ ss@@ enti@@ ally hal@@ lo@@ ween than ha@@ un@@ ted houses .
they have the best names , like &quot; terror behind the walls &quot; ( which , by the way is in an actual prison ) , &quot; ho@@ w@@ l-@@ o-@@ scre@@ am &quot; and &quot; the house of sho@@ ck . &quot;
in fact , there are 1,@@ 200 officially sanc@@ tioned ha@@ un@@ ted houses in the united states gener@@ ating about $ 500 million in revenue , according to america ha@@ un@@ ts , and that includes those aw@@ es@@ ome photos of you mid-@@ pe@@ eing your p@@ ants that your friend puts on fac@@ e@@ book and you can &apos;t take down and then that gu@@ y you like sees the photo and leaves a comment like &quot; nice face . &quot;
finally , let &apos;s talk pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins .
char@@ lie brown introduced us to the great pum@@ p@@ k@@ in when we were kids , and car@@ ving a jack@@ -@@ o-@@ lan@@ ter@@ n is like decor@@ ating a christmas tree - it &apos;s something we &apos;ve done since we were little .
lu@@ cky for us , the &quot; baby in a pum@@ p@@ k@@ in trend &quot; started only last year thanks to p@@ interest , so most of us grew up car@@ ving these gour@@ ds not sitting in them .
this year , americans will spend around $ 10@@ 6 million on pum@@ p@@ k@@ ins , according to the u.s. cen@@ sus bureau .
the jack@@ -@@ o-@@ lan@@ ter@@ n slowly with@@ ering on your front por@@ ch probably came from il@@ lin@@ o@@ is , which grew 5@@ 42 million p@@ ounds of pum@@ p@@ k@@ in this year .

house fire in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ ch@@ ts : rescue services re@@ tri@@ eve char@@ red body
the fire service were called out to hel@@ m@@ bre@@ ch@@ ts late on thursday evening .
a three-@@ bedroom house in the district of hof cat@@ ches fire during the night .
rescue workers re@@ tri@@ eve a char@@ red body from the house .
during a fire in hel@@ m@@ bre@@ ch@@ ts , rescue services found a char@@ red body in a three-@@ bedroom house .
whether this person was living in the house is as yet un@@ clear , said a police spo@@ kes@@ person in bay@@ re@@ u@@ th .
late on thursday evening , fire bro@@ ke out on the ground floor of the house .
when the fire service arrived , the fl@@ ames were already bur@@ sting out of a window .
rescue workers entered the premises and found the body in a bedroom .
this and another bedroom were completely bur@@ nt out .
the entire ground floor suffered damage .
there were no other residents at home during the fire , continued the police spo@@ kes@@ person .
for the time being , the house is no longer hab@@ itable .
the precise cause of the fire was initially un@@ clear .
germany &apos;s largest national church has launched a campaign advertising the minister &apos;s position .
this comes at the same time as a possible short@@ age of ministers : the prote@@ stant lu@@ ther@@ an regional church of han@@ over calcu@@ lates that , as things stand , the current number of around 1,@@ 800 pa@@ st@@ ors will be hal@@ ved by 20@@ 30 .
for the young people of today , the career is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said pa@@ st@@ or ma@@ this bur@@ fi@@ en ( 43 ) in a con@@ vers@@ ation with the prote@@ stant press service .
it is attractive to be able to determine your own daily working rout@@ ine .
with bur@@ fi@@ en , the regional church has for first time commission@@ ed a minister to work full time , endeav@@ our@@ ing to in@@ sp@@ ire young people to study the@@ ology .
at present , fewer and fewer young people are deci@@ ding to study the@@ ology after their ab@@ it@@ ur exam@@ inations ( equivalent to a levels ) .
bur@@ fi@@ en puts this down to the process of sec@@ ul@@ ar@@ isation : &quot; god &apos;s voice is quiet , the world is l@@ oud &quot; .
the job is characterised by great freedom and variety .
i am the master of my own schedule and can therefore turn my focus to what is important to me .
as pa@@ stor@@ al workers , ministers can be close to people .
they earn as much as teachers and can make a good living .
of course wages are higher within the private sector , but on the other hand , the@@ o@@ logi@@ ans have a secure employ@@ er .
this would suit the young people of today , as it is not just about your career , but about having a meaning@@ ful job as well .
according to information from the regional church , which covers three quarters of lower sa@@ x@@ ony , around 60 pa@@ st@@ ors reti@@ re every year .
at the same time , around 40 the@@ ology gradu@@ ates begin as vic@@ ars .
in future it may be difficult to fill positions in spar@@ sely popu@@ lated out@@ lying areas such as har@@ z , em@@ s@@ land or w@@ end@@ land .
among other initiatives , bur@@ fi@@ en wants to organise study days for young people , inv@@ iting famous faces who have studied the@@ ology .
the@@ ology courses offer broad training .
you can even become federal president with a the@@ ology degree .

fire cre@@ ws called to rescue lost pu@@ pp@@ y after she got st@@ uck 50@@ ft above the ground on prec@@ ari@@ ous le@@ dge in a quar@@ ry
cock@@ er sp@@ ani@@ el ru@@ by had run off after she was in a minor road cr@@ ash
she was spo@@ t@@ ted three days later by a dog wal@@ ker tr@@ app@@ ed in the quar@@ ry
fire@@ figh@@ ters ab@@ se@@ il down cli@@ ff face to pl@@ uck the dog from certain death
a pu@@ pp@@ y had a lu@@ cky escape after fire cre@@ ws were called to lift her to safety when she some@@ how got her@@ self st@@ uck 50@@ ft up on a prec@@ ari@@ ous cli@@ ff le@@ dge .
nine mon@@ th-@@ old cock@@ er sp@@ ani@@ el ru@@ by had run off after being involved in a road cr@@ ash on sunday afternoon and survi@@ ved three days alone before being rescu@@ ed from a quar@@ ry on wednesday .
her owners scot@@ t al@@ der@@ son , 25 , and his gir@@ l@@ friend bec@@ ky hall , 20 , were at fla@@ pp@@ it quar@@ ry in den@@ hol@@ me , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , to be re@@ united with ru@@ by and have than@@ ked west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire fire and rescue service .
they had sear@@ ched fran@@ tically for their missing dog and posted appe@@ als on social net@@ working sites after she had ran into the quar@@ ry following the minor accident .
at around 2.@@ 15@@ pm on wednesday , an e@@ ag@@ le-@@ e@@ yed dog wal@@ ker spo@@ t@@ ted ru@@ by on the le@@ dge in the quar@@ ry , str@@ an@@ ded 50@@ ft up .
a technical rescue team from cl@@ ec@@ k@@ he@@ at@@ on fire station rus@@ hed to the scene and ab@@ se@@ iled down to rescue ru@@ by and used a pet tube to transport her up the cli@@ ff .
specialist technical rescue officer and@@ y cla@@ y@@ ton said : &apos; she was in a prec@@ ari@@ ous situation .
she was right in the middle of the cli@@ ff face - 50@@ ft from the top and bottom .
she did not move a mus@@ cle during the rescue - she was fro@@ zen solid .
but she is fine now .
she was eating bis@@ cu@@ its afterwards .
this was a very unusual call@@ -@@ out .
the fact that the dog was spo@@ t@@ ted is un@@ believ@@ able .
specialist technical rescue officer peter la@@ u said : &quot; ru@@ by had a very lu@@ cky escape . &quot;
the potential was there that she could have been very seriously in@@ ju@@ red or worse .
ru@@ by was taken to the ve@@ ts for a check-@@ up and was found to be fine other than exhaus@@ tion and de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
miss hall , from h@@ ali@@ fax , west yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire , said : &quot; watching the rescue was terri@@ fying . &quot;
i could not believe that she was up there in the first place .
it was amazing to get her back in our arms .
the ve@@ t said that if she became too exhaus@@ ted and collap@@ sed she would probably have fallen .
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were amazing .
it was really dar@@ ing what they did .
we are just so grateful and every single one of them was absolutely tremend@@ ous .
mr al@@ der@@ son , from ke@@ i@@ gh@@ ley , added : &quot; we were s@@ ca@@ red that she might fall but she stayed there . &quot;
the fire@@ figh@@ ters were br@@ illi@@ ant .
i just can &apos;t believe where she was .

george ke@@ rev@@ an : europe break@@ -up gives sco@@ ts choice
another day , another independence sc@@ are story .
this time we are war@@ ned that an independent scotland would be required to join the europe@@ -@@ wide fre@@ e-@@ travel zone as a condition of eu membership .
cu@@ e stories about pass@@ port controls at ber@@ w@@ ick and a bar@@ bed wire border along h@@ adri@@ an &apos;s wall .
true , the stra@@ th@@ cl@@ y@@ de paper pointed out the possible economic benefits of fre@@ er movement with the rest of europe , though - predic@@ tably - that did not figure in the head@@ lines .
nor did anyone point out that the eu member states spend much of their time ben@@ ding their formal rules if it su@@ its them .
since scotland isn &apos;t in the schengen area now , continued non-@@ compliance would be a cheap conc@@ ession for brussels to offer up in return for whatever it really wanted out of the sco@@ ts .
so , a non-@@ story , then .
and one that is so long in the to@@ oth it has become fo@@ ssi@@ lis@@ ed : i first heard the &quot; independence means pass@@ port controls &quot; can@@ ard at least 40 years ago .
yet there is an interesting point lost in this re@@ telling of a wh@@ is@@ k@@ ery old tal@@ e .
why should an independent scotland be expected to do europe &apos;s bi@@ d@@ ding , anyway ?
why trade london &apos;s yo@@ ke for that of brussels , especially now ?
here is the real european news : the great , post-@@ war plan to un@@ ite europe has finally st@@ alled .
with the euro crisis , project europe is officially dead .
across the eu , parties which are dedicated to oppos@@ ing the eu , or to sc@@ ra@@ pping the euro as a common currency , are gaining ground .
even in germany , the euro@@ s@@ cep@@ tic alternative for germany party - founded only this year - came from no@@ where to gra@@ b nearly five million votes in september &apos;s federal elections , thus effectively kno@@ cking the free democrats ( equivalent to our own li@@ b de@@ ms ) out of the bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g .
there has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal europe .
however , the current economic crisis has proved a water@@ sh@@ ed .
the au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by berlin and the european central bank , cou@@ pled with the stra@@ it@@ jack@@ et imposed on national economies through adhe@@ rence to the common currency , has led many people to think project europe has gone too far .
the crisis of the euro has little to do with national governments running excessive budget deficits - that was true only of greece .
rather , the euro system loc@@ ked in its members at exchange rates favourable to german ex@@ porters - something german politicians want to keep .
without the possibility of domestic currency de@@ valu@@ ation , southern europe finds itself with a buil@@ t-@@ in productivity dis@@ advantage vis@@ -@@ à@@ -@@ vis germany .
the only rec@@ our@@ se is to sl@@ ash wages and public spending - sp@@ ur@@ red on by berlin .
beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a de@@ eper european productivity mal@@ a@@ ise .
as a result of &quot; green &quot; energy policies imposed by brussels - code for subsid@@ ising french and german energy firms at the consumer &apos;s expense - european industry pays twice as much for electricity , and four times as much for gas , as in the united states .
that is a cri@@ p@@ pling cost dis@@ advantage , as we &apos;ve already seen at gr@@ ang@@ em@@ ou@@ th .
all the wage free@@ zes in the world won &apos;t stop the european petro@@ chemicals industry being ham@@ me@@ red by cheap us sh@@ ale gas .
as a result , re@@ vol@@ t is bre@@ wing , especially in france , once the eu &apos;s main che@@ er@@ leader .
after the war , the french political elite saw the eu as a vehicle to keep germany in check , and to give paris equal b@@ illing in the world with washington .
but berlin no longer needs paris as a pass@@ port to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on europe , leaving the bat@@ tered french economy strugg@@ ling .
result : marine le pen &apos;s right-@@ wing , anti-@@ eu national front has just won a crucial by-@@ election , kno@@ cking the ruling socialists into third place .
the front is now the most popular party in france with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to british labour that they can &apos;t assume a split on the right will automatically favour the left .
what is le pen doing with her new@@ found popul@@ arity among the french white , working class ?
she wants to use next year &apos;s eu elections to create an anti-@@ eu , anti-@@ common currency blo@@ c across the european parliament .
if , as is very possible , anti-@@ eu parties do well in these elections , such a blo@@ c could domin@@ ate the european parliament for the first time .
here &apos;s my point : some@@ time soon growing anti-@@ eu and anti-@@ common currency feeling in europe will co@@ al@@ es@@ ce to kill the euro .
the eu won &apos;t dis@@ appear , but it will rever@@ t to something more like the lo@@ ose &quot; europe of the ( sovereign ) nations &quot; fav@@ oured by general de ga@@ ul@@ le .
germany and a few of its satellite economies might keep the euro but france and southern europe will revi@@ ve their own curren@@ cies .
i expect the uk will distance itself from this project , ho@@ ping to cosy up to the us .
however , washington &apos;s growing interest in the pacific suggests britain will be left out in the atlantic cold .
where does this leave scotland ?
we can choose to be a region of ( essentially ) little england .
or we can defend our own economic interests - which includes telling berlin and brussels where to get off .
i susp@@ ect that scotland could do well inside a loo@@ ser european arrangement provided we kept our own currency .
co-operation with other like@@ -@@ min@@ ded countries will be easier in a non-@@ federal europe of the nations .
otherwise we should consider em@@ ulating norway and re@@ taining our economic independence .
the sn@@ p government in scotland is - remark@@ ab@@ ly-@@ - the most successful anti-@@ au@@ ster@@ ity political movement in europe , having won a spectacular majority in 2011 on the basis of oppos@@ ing the cuts proposed ( and implemented ) by labour &apos;s chancell@@ or ali@@ sta@@ ir dar@@ ling and the subsequent tor@@ y-@@ li@@ b dem coalition .
it would be ri@@ dic@@ ulous now for scotland to vote for independence only to accept au@@ ster@@ ity imposed by berlin and brussels .
early pub@@ er@@ ty : growing older so@@ on@@ er
afric@@ an-@@ american and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic girls tend to reach pub@@ er@@ ty earlier than their white counter@@ parts , research shows .
physical changes don &apos;t mean pub@@ er@@ ty is im@@ minent
there &apos;s no evidence that hor@@ mon@@ es or other chemicals are to blame
experts think the ob@@ es@@ ity ep@@ ide@@ mic might be one tri@@ gger of early pub@@ er@@ ty
the trend toward early pub@@ er@@ ty is not as pron@@ oun@@ ced with bo@@ ys
former c@@ n@@ n correspon@@ dent p@@ at e@@ ther@@ id@@ ge is a journ@@ alist speci@@ alizing in children &apos;s health and family issues .
should a mother be al@@ armed if her daughter begins to spr@@ out bre@@ ast bu@@ ds and pub@@ ic hair at 7 or 8 ?
at the annual conference of the american academy of pedi@@ at@@ ric@@ s this week in or@@ lan@@ do , fl@@ ori@@ da , pedi@@ at@@ ric en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. paul k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z explained that these early physical changes are quite common among american girls and represent a new nor@@ m .
&quot; i spend a lot of time re@@ ass@@ uring parents -- usually , this does not signal a rapid progres@@ sion into full pub@@ er@@ ty , &quot; said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z .
obvious signs of development , such as bud@@ ding bre@@ asts , pub@@ ic and under@@ arm hair and body od@@ or are appe@@ aring so@@ on@@ er in girls .
but there has been only a s@@ light shift in the age of men@@ ar@@ che ( the first period ) over the past four decades .
in the united states , the average age is 12.@@ 5 years , down from 12.@@ 75 in 197@@ 0 .
&quot; once bre@@ asts begin to develop , it takes at least two to three years before men@@ ar@@ che , &quot; said k@@ ap@@ lo@@ wit@@ z , also author of &quot; early pub@@ er@@ ty in girls : the essential guide to cop@@ ing with this common problem . &quot;
time is the most accurate test of how pub@@ er@@ ty is going to progress .
there is debate about what constitutes the actual on@@ set of pub@@ er@@ ty , but it is considered &quot; pre@@ co@@ ci@@ ous &quot; when bre@@ ast enlargement is accompanied by a growth sp@@ ur@@ t before age 8 .
in most cases , the process will slow down or st@@ all -- something a pedi@@ at@@ r@@ ici@@ an can monitor closely .
a more rapid progres@@ sion may warrant tests by an en@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ o@@ log@@ ist to rule out serious problems such as t@@ um@@ ors or cy@@ sts .
there are treatments to delay early men@@ ses and ward off another consequence : pre@@ mature aging of the b@@ ones that ultimately can lead to stun@@ ted growth and being short as an adult .
recommendations for drug or hor@@ m@@ one therapy are based on the child &apos;s age , rate of development , growth rate and emo@@ tional mat@@ ur@@ ity .
psycho@@ social aspects are important , too .

the other big issue is understand@@ able : parents simply don &apos;t want their very young dau@@ gh@@ ters having periods .

jet makers f@@ eu@@ d over seat width with big orders at stake
a row has fla@@ red up between leading plane makers over the width of touri@@ st-@@ class seats on long-@@ distance flights , setting the tone for a bit@@ ter confron@@ tation at this month &apos;s du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show .
the dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-@@ hau@@ l flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most cour@@ ted by airlines , but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest je@@ ts offered by airbus s@@ as and bo@@ eing co .
airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 in@@ ches ( 46 cm ) wide in economy cab@@ ins , but its u.s. arch@@ -@@ ri@@ val bo@@ eing says it should be for airlines to decide .
the dispute comes as plane makers vi@@ e to sell ever@@ -@@ larger versions of their tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ distance aircraft , with potentially record orders expected at the november 17@@ -@@ 21 event .
how the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether se@@ ating is 9 or 10 ab@@ re@@ ast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new &quot; mini-@@ jum@@ bo &quot; jet designs .
bo@@ eing says its rev@@ amp@@ ed &quot; 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x &quot; will hold 4@@ 06 people based on economy seats more than 17 in@@ ches wide and set out 10 in each row .
airbus says the compe@@ ting version of its a3@@ 50 will carry 3@@ 50 people in 18@@ -@@ in@@ ch-@@ wide economy seat laid out 9 ab@@ re@@ ast .
plane gi@@ ants often trade b@@ lows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press .
now , airbus is appe@@ aling directly to the public ahead of the du@@ ba@@ i air@@ show , where the 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x is expected to domin@@ ate with more than 100 orders .
it recently pre@@ viewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing finan@@ ci@@ ers a sli@@ de illu@@ str@@ ating three people squ@@ ash@@ ed together at a restaurant , ti@@ tled &quot; would you accept this ? &quot;
&quot; bo@@ eing is proposing long-@@ distance flying in seats nar@@ ro@@ wer than regional tur@@ bo@@ -@@ pro@@ ps , &quot; said airbus sales chief john lea@@ h@@ y .
as di@@ ets change , people get bigger but plane se@@ ating has not rad@@ ically changed .
between the early 197@@ 0s , when the bo@@ eing 7@@ 47 jum@@ bo defined modern long-@@ hau@@ l travel , and the turn of the century , the weight of the average american 40@@ - to 4@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old male increased by 10 per cent , according to u.s. health department data .
the wa@@ ist of the average 2@@ 1@@ st-@@ century american male is 3@@ 9.@@ 7 in@@ ches , according to u.s. health statistics .
airbus says its ri@@ val is stic@@ king to a seat concept from the 195@@ 0s , when the average gir@@ th of the newly christ@@ ened &quot; jet set &quot; was nar@@ ro@@ wer .
airbus says it has commission@@ ed research sugge@@ sting an extra in@@ ch in seat width impro@@ ves sleep quality by 53 per cent .
bo@@ eing disputes airbus &apos;s figures on seat measure@@ ments and says it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fa@@ res and facilities .
it also says research shows cab@@ in experience depends on more than the width of a seat .
&quot; it really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful , &quot; said bo@@ eing cab@@ ins expert k@@ ent cra@@ ver .
they don &apos;t want us to dict@@ ate to them what makes them prof@@ itable .
they know their business better than anyone else .
for fl@@ yers it is about more el@@ bo@@ w room , but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that could affect ear@@ nings .
behind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least $ 7@@ 00@@ -@@ billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades , enough to tip the sc@@ ales of u.s. and european exports .
as re@@ u@@ ters first reported in july , seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest je@@ ts .
both airbus and bo@@ eing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest tw@@ in-@@ eng@@ ined long-@@ hau@@ l designs than the market leader in that segment , the 3@@ 6@@ 5-@@ seat bo@@ eing 7@@ 7@@ 7-@@ 3@@ 00@@ er .
bo@@ eing &apos;s performance claims depend in part on compar@@ ing the 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x with an original 9-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast 7@@ 77 design .
the gain in unit costs is bl@@ un@@ ted compared with 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast now in use .
&quot; the reason bo@@ eing are doing this is to cra@@ m more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products , &quot; said k@@ ev@@ in ken@@ i@@ ston , head of passenger comfort at europe &apos;s airbus .
on the other hand , analy@@ sts say full 10-@@ se@@ at-@@ per@@ -@@ row cab@@ ins for existing 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ s suggest many passengers are voting for the den@@ ser layout , which may go hand in hand with cheaper fa@@ res .
&quot; eigh@@ teen in@@ ches in seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from a business point of the airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 7@@ 77 , &quot; said cab@@ in inter@@ i@@ ors expert mar@@ y kir@@ by , founder and editor of the run@@ way girl network .
airbus and bo@@ eing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from .
glo@@ be@@ -@@ tro@@ tting jet sel@@ lers even carry tape measures to check on compe@@ ting la@@ you@@ ts .
while bo@@ a@@ sting comfort , all buil@@ ders also offer je@@ ts with high-@@ den@@ sity la@@ you@@ ts for low-@@ cost airlines and regional travel .
airbus offers a 10-@@ ab@@ re@@ ast a3@@ 50 but says it has not yet sold it .
until recently , airbus was stres@@ sing the need for more cab@@ in custom@@ ization by offering wider a@@ is@@ le seats on some of its je@@ ts .
without the support of the only other maker of large modern je@@ ts , experts say its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly , but could di@@ str@@ act from a wave of 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ x sales .
new anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine could take the pleasure out of smoking
scientists have developed an anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine that could take the pleasure out of smoking a ci@@ gare@@ tte .
a single do@@ se of the vacc@@ ine was able to protect m@@ ice against nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction for life .
further tests are needed before starting human tri@@ als , which would take several years , but professor ron@@ ald crystal of we@@ ill cor@@ n@@ ell medical college in new york said the early signs are good .
&quot; we are very hope@@ ful that this kind of vacc@@ ine strategy can finally help the millions of smo@@ kers who have tried to stop , ex@@ hau@@ sting all the methods on the market today , but find their nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction to be strong enough to overcome these current approaches , &quot; pr@@ of cor@@ n@@ ell said .
the new vacc@@ ine contains a harm@@ less virus that has been engine@@ ered to carry the genetic information to make anti-@@ nic@@ ot@@ ine anti@@ bodies .
the virus selec@@ tively inf@@ ects li@@ ver cells , which then start to make a stead@@ y stream of the anti@@ bodies .
the anti@@ bodies hun@@ t down any nic@@ ot@@ ine mo@@ lec@@ ules in the bloo@@ d@@ stream , neutr@@ alising them before they reached the brain , preventing a smo@@ ker from getting a nic@@ ot@@ ine hit .
in tests , vacc@@ inated m@@ ice who were subsequently given nic@@ ot@@ ine continued with their normal activity .
but m@@ ice who had not been given the vacc@@ ine &quot; ch@@ illed out , &quot; say the researchers , a sign that the nic@@ ot@@ ine had reached their bra@@ ins .
the experim@@ ents are described in the journal science trans@@ la@@ tional medicine .
previous tobacco vacc@@ ines failed because they contained anti@@ bodies .
the j@@ ab@@ s had to be given so frequently to keep anti@@ body levels top@@ ped up that they proved expensive and im@@ practical .
but the cost of the new vacc@@ ine is likely to be far lower , because it turns li@@ ver cells into anti@@ body fac@@ tories .
pr@@ of crystal said that if a future human vacc@@ ine was completely safe it could be given to children before they were temp@@ ted to try a ci@@ gare@@ tte , preventing nic@@ ot@@ ine ad@@ diction .
but more likely it would be used by smo@@ kers to qu@@ it .
&quot; they will know if they start smoking again , they will receive no pleasure from it due to the nic@@ ot@@ ine vacc@@ ine , and that can help them k@@ ick the hab@@ it , &quot; he said .
british scientists said the results were interesting but war@@ ned far more research was needed .
tri@@ po@@ di den@@ ies being influenced by o@@ be@@ id
former n@@ s@@ w labor minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di will be investig@@ ated by the state &apos;s corruption wat@@ ch@@ dog .
former n@@ s@@ w minister jo@@ e tri@@ po@@ di has denied changing maritime le@@ ases policy at the request of his political ment@@ or ed@@ die o@@ be@@ id , who had hidden interests in three properties on govern@@ ment@@ -@@ controlled land .
the independent commission against corruption ( ic@@ ac ) on friday wi@@ den@@ ed its inquiry into whether mr o@@ be@@ id lob@@ bi@@ ed several state ministers to have le@@ ases at circu@@ lar qu@@ ay , where the o@@ be@@ ids owned two restaurants and a caf@@ e , renewed without going to ten@@ der after their exp@@ ir@@ ation in august 2005 .
it &apos;s now investig@@ ating alleg@@ ations mr tri@@ po@@ di knew of mr o@@ be@@ id &apos;s secret interest in the properties , after evidence given by mr tri@@ po@@ di &apos;s former depu@@ ty chief of staff , ly@@ n@@ ne ash@@ po@@ le , on thursday .
during years of discussions starting in 2005 the government had been pus@@ hing for the le@@ ases to go to public ten@@ der .
the les@@ sees were against this and also wanted longer terms .
in 2009 le@@ ases for the circu@@ lar qu@@ ay enterprises , which earned the o@@ be@@ ids about $ 2.5 million ann@@ ually , were renewed without going to public ten@@ der .
mr tri@@ po@@ di , who was ports minister from february 2006 until november 2009 , was initially in favour of public tend@@ ers .
but he denied the changes were made at the request of mr o@@ be@@ id , who mr tri@@ po@@ di acknowledged was ur@@ ging a shift in government le@@ ase policy .
a phone trans@@ cript tabled in ic@@ ac showed calls in august and september 2007 between mr o@@ be@@ id , mr tri@@ po@@ di and ste@@ ve dun@@ n , a senior bureaucr@@ at who had come into the ports ministry after working under mr o@@ be@@ id in the fisheries department .
&quot; was the matter being discussed in the course of these telephone conver@@ sa@@ tions the development of the commercial le@@ ase policy , &quot; assi@@ stant commissioner an@@ th@@ ony whe@@ al@@ y asked mr tri@@ po@@ di .
&quot; no , &quot; mr tri@@ po@@ di rep@@ lied .
i can &apos;t remember what was discussed but it definitely was@@ n &apos;t that .
definitely not between myself and mr o@@ be@@ id .
israeli war@@ plan@@ es attack target inside syria , official says
israeli war@@ plan@@ es struck a target inside the sy@@ ri@@ an port city of lat@@ ak@@ ia thursday night , a senior administration official confir@@ ms to fox news .
the official did not specify what the target was , but said there was at least one .

foreign workers on 4@@ 57 vis@@ as could under@@ go &quot; genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess &quot; test
a &quot; genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess &quot; test for foreign workers on 4@@ 57 vis@@ as is being considered by the government as it con@@ tem@@ plates expanding a cr@@ ack@@ down .
the test , if adopted , would be applied through a criteria aimed at preventing 4@@ 5@@ 7@@ s being used to fill un@@ skilled positions or as a back door way to move family and friends to australia .
a government discussion paper was released today as former labor mp max@@ ine mc@@ ke@@ w s@@ lam@@ med the government &apos;s rhe@@ tor@@ ic about foreign workers , saying it could off@@ end australia &apos;s neighbours .
&quot; l@@ oud declarations about &apos; foreign@@ ers getting to the back of the qu@@ eu@@ e &apos; and &apos; aus@@ sie jobs first &apos; are a very un@@ pleasant thro@@ w@@ back to a time when unions demanded a protected labor market , &quot; she told the australia india institute today .
histor@@ ically , that meant it was white labour that had to be protected - and if some in the region saw ec@@ ho@@ es of that historic arti@@ fact , i w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t be surprised .
the discussion paper out@@ lines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister chr@@ is bow@@ en .
immigration minister bren@@ dan o &apos;@@ con@@ nor , who was yesterday in s@@ ri lan@@ ka where he is meeting officials about people s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling , has implemented five of the recommended changes with the remain@@ der under consideration .
if the &quot; genu@@ in@@ en@@ ess &quot; criteria was adopted a visa applicant could be scrut@@ in@@ ised about &quot; whether the nom@@ ination is genuine in circumstances where the nom@@ ine@@ e is a relation or personal associ@@ ate of an owner or relevant person of the spon@@ s@@ oring business . &quot;
businesses could also be required to account for the number of 4@@ 57 visa holders after previously businesses who had intended to spon@@ sor a small number of workers then employed hundreds .
meanwhile , a 3@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old s@@ ri lan@@ k@@ an asylum see@@ ker died of a susp@@ ected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat at christmas island this week .

austr@@ ali@@ an authorities rus@@ hed the man to christmas island hospital , where he died .
a study aim@@ ing to increase the benefits to scotland of the h@@ s@@ 2 rail project has been announced by the uk government .
the work by h@@ s@@ 2 ltd suggests high-@@ speed services to scotland and the north of england will start as soon as phase one opens in 20@@ 26 .
transport minister bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said the project would &quot; bring the uk together . &quot;
scot@@ tish transport minister ke@@ ith brown said he was &quot; ex@@ ci@@ ted &quot; to work with the uk government on the plan .
phase one will consist of a new high speed rail line between london and the west mid@@ lands .
when phase two is completed , lines will run to man@@ ch@@ ester and le@@ eds .
in june the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-@@ speed link between london and the north of england from £ 3@@ 2.@@ 7@@ b@@ n to £ 4@@ 2.@@ 6@@ b@@ n@@ .
the uk government , which has been holding talks with transport scotland , has instruc@@ ted h@@ s@@ 2 ltd to look at further rail capacity and journey time improvements for northern england and scotland .
this is to include the possibility of event@@ ual journey times from gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh to london of three hours or less .
bar@@ on@@ ess k@@ ram@@ er said : &quot; our goal for h@@ s@@ 2 is for a truly national network that will bring the uk and its cities closer together . &quot;
we are driving forward h@@ s@@ 2 because the benefits it will bring are huge .
without it we face a crisis in capacity on our rail network .
but it is also about connec@@ tivity , across the uk 18 cities including gl@@ as@@ go@@ w and ed@@ in@@ burgh will be better connected because of h@@ s@@ 2 .
scot@@ tish secretary ali@@ sta@@ ir car@@ michael added : &quot; today &apos;s announcement is good news for scotland . &quot;
for the scot@@ tish government , ke@@ ith brown called on mr car@@ michael to &quot; un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally &quot; back scotland &apos;s inclusion in the h@@ s@@ 2 network .
mr brown said : &quot; high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to scotland , but also adds scotland &apos;s economic weight to the overall case for high speed rail across britain . &quot;
so we are ex@@ ci@@ ted to work in partnership with the uk government to examine options for bringing high speed rail to scotland , creating benefit for all and comple@@ ment@@ ing the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w-@@ ed@@ in@@ burgh line which the scot@@ tish government is already planning .
i look forward to re@@ viewing the report of the investigation with uk ministers next year and together decide on the next steps .
aircraft electronic device rules to stay in force in australia for now
austr@@ ali@@ an airline passengers will need to continue turning off their tab@@ lets and smart phones during take@@ -@@ off and lan@@ ding despite moves in the us to loo@@ sen regulations covering the devices .
the us federal aviation administration has left the way open for american carri@@ ers to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-@@ books , watch videos or play games on their devices during critical ph@@ ases of flight provided they remain in &quot; air@@ plane &quot; mode .
passengers can already do this during the bul@@ k of a flight but many people find it an@@ no@@ ying to be unable to access their e-@@ books during take@@ -@@ off@@ s and land@@ ings .
austr@@ ali@@ an carri@@ ers are looking at the decision , which requires us carri@@ ers to undertake a massive amount of work to meet the requirements , but have indicated they have no immediate plans to change their procedures .
the civil aviation safety authority also said it was looking at the announcement but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical ph@@ ases of flight were still in place in australia .
&quot; casa currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft , &quot; it said .
the issue is covered by regulations which require aircraft operators to ensure safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members .
vir@@ gin , which has already been talking to casa about extending the use its in-@@ flight wi-fi entertainment system , was am@@ enable to a change but said it would take its lead from the regul@@ ator .
&quot; we would welcome a review by casa into allowing the use of electronic devices because we really do think it will improve the customer experience now that we have ( wireless in-@@ flight entertainment ) on our plan@@ es , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
q@@ ant@@ as said it would stick with the current rules for now .
&quot; our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take@@ -@@ off and lan@@ ding and we have no immediate plans to change that , &quot; it said .
the fa@@ a ruling applies to american airlines .
however , we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers and we will certainly be taking a close look at the fa@@ a &apos;s decision and the reasons behind it .
for us carri@@ ers , the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet .
carri@@ ers will need to prove their plan@@ es can toler@@ ate radio inter@@ ference from mobile devices as well as rev@@ ise manu@@ als , training materials , car@@ r@@ y-@@ on bag@@ gage programs and passenger brief@@ ings .
&quot; once an airline veri@@ fies the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use hand@@ held , light@@ weight electronic devices such as tab@@ lets , e-@@ read@@ ers , and smar@@ t@@ ph@@ on@@ es-@@ at all al@@ titu@@ des , &quot; the fa@@ a said .
in rare in@@ stances of low vi@@ sibility , the crew will instruc@@ t passengers to turn off their devices during lan@@ ding .
the group also recommended that he@@ avi@@ er devices should be safe@@ ly sto@@ wed under seats or in over@@ head b@@ ins during take@@ -@@ off and lan@@ ding .
travelling b@@ v@@ b fans created terrible scenes with fla@@ res in the vel@@ t@@ ins arena before the district der@@ by against sch@@ al@@ ke
bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d announced that there would be serious consequences .
before friday &apos;s bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match against v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , the &apos; ul@@ tr@@ as &apos; respon@@ ded with silence - initially .
it was an unusual , almost g@@ ho@@ stly atmosphere that the fans created until shortly before the k@@ ick@@ -@@ off of the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a match between the german run@@ ner@@ s-@@ up bor@@ us@@ sia dor@@ t@@ m@@ end and v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart , in the signal id@@ una park .
it was mainly the chan@@ ts of away fans that could be heard .
the south stand , on the other hand , where the most loy@@ al - and the lou@@ dest - of b@@ v@@ b fans stand , was initially un@@ usually quiet : no sing@@ ing and no battle cri@@ es .
the &apos; cap@@ o &apos;s &apos; po@@ dium , the individual who usually coordin@@ ates the un@@ ison chan@@ ts , remained empty .
and right at the front , on the stand , a single large flag with the text &quot; sta@@ dium ban section &quot; ble@@ w in the wind .
only when go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper , roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er , was the first b@@ v@@ b player to step onto the field , did che@@ ers briefly er@@ up@@ t , as is usually the case .
when his team mates followed , there was l@@ oud sing@@ ing and scar@@ ves were w@@ av@@ ing - but by no means everywhere .
in the central blocks of the south stand , blocks 12 and 13 , nothing moved .
even sta@@ dium announ@@ cer , nor@@ bert dic@@ kel , speaking once again of the successful results in recent days - the der@@ by victory , the win against ar@@ sen@@ al , the contract extension of co@@ ach j@@ ör@@ gen k@@ lo@@ p@@ p - did not raise spir@@ its .
just five minutes before k@@ ick@@ -@@ off , the cap@@ o clim@@ bed onto his po@@ dium - and the tension that had been almost tangible up until that point , lif@@ ted with a large sh@@ out , as dic@@ kel asked for a sh@@ out from each section of fans as usual .
as always , the south stand was left until the end , and finally the stand re@@ sumed its usual role as the lou@@ dest section of the sta@@ dium .
and as soon as the vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous request for &quot; der@@ by winners stand up &quot; came from the south stand upon k@@ ick@@ -@@ off , everything was back to normal .
the previous silence was indeed a reaction to the events of previous days .
immediately before the local district der@@ by against f@@ c sch@@ al@@ ke 04 , some of the travelling b@@ v@@ b fans fi@@ red fla@@ res into the crow@@ ds of spec@@ t@@ ators and onto the pit@@ ch - and in so doing almost hit go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper roman we@@ iden@@ f@@ ell@@ er .
the k@@ ick@@ -@@ off was dela@@ yed on account of the cha@@ otic scenes ,
as a result , b@@ v@@ b chairman h@@ ans jo@@ achi@@ m wat@@ z@@ ke had invited the heads of the dor@@ t@@ mun@@ d ul@@ tr@@ as fan group to his office - and if wat@@ z@@ ke &apos;s words are to be believed , this was a rather un@@ comfortable meeting for the fan representatives .
&quot; there will be massive impact for the entire ul@@ tra movement , &quot; announced the b@@ v@@ b chairman on thursday evening at a panel discussion in frankfurt .
as an immediate measure , wat@@ z@@ ke prohibited the ul@@ tr@@ as from organis@@ ing cho@@ re@@ o@@ graphy for the home match against v@@ f@@ b stutt@@ gart .
&quot; i have banned it , &quot; he explained .
we cannot ignore the zero tolerance policy regarding py@@ ro@@ techn@@ ics in sa@@ x@@ ony .
in addition , the ul@@ tr@@ as were given the option of several different pun@@ ish@@ ments - they now have until tuesday to decide which one to accept .
otherwise b@@ v@@ b will impose a sanc@@ tion by the end of next week , said wat@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; it will be severe , &quot; assured wat@@ z@@ ke .
it will be interesting to see the re@@ actions in the south stand then .
pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers shine in sing@@ apor@@ e as middle class feel the pin@@ ch
at a pa@@ wn@@ shop in ben@@ de@@ me@@ er shopping centre in sing@@ apor@@ e , jan@@ ani am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a is sw@@ app@@ ing a gold ban@@ g@@ le , ring and pair of ear@@ r@@ ings to pay her dau@@ gh@@ ters &quot; school fees .
&quot; my hus@@ band and i have just bought a house so all my money &apos;s st@@ uck there , &quot; mrs am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a says .
even though she ear@@ ns s $ 3@@ ,000 ( $ 2,@@ 400 ) a month as an administr@@ ator and her hus@@ band works as well , the monthly family income is insufficient , she says .
indeed , such is demand across parts of sou@@ the@@ ast asia - where household debt is rising - that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , where she is carrying out her transaction , this week became the third pa@@ wn@@ shop to list on the sing@@ apor@@ e stock exchange .
pa@@ w@@ ning je@@ well@@ ery is not merely a fast way to land cash - s $ 1,@@ 300 in ms am@@ ir@@ th@@ al@@ ing@@ a &apos;s case - but almost as cheap as un@@ secured bank loans .
typically pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers in sing@@ apor@@ e charge an effective annual percentage rate of 17 per cent , just above the 15@@ .@@ 4 per cent offered at united over@@ seas bank , a local len@@ der with a branch in the same shopping centre .
however , pa@@ wn@@ bro@@ kers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of sal@@ ary , and can arrange loans faster than banks .
hence millions of people across the region are turning to pa@@ wn@@ shops as families feel the squ@@ ee@@ ze from rising living costs and bal@@ lo@@ oning household and consumer debt .
after five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit fu@@ elled by lo@@ ose monetary policy in advanced economies , low@@ er@@ - and mid@@ d@@ le-@@ income families are turning to pa@@ wn shops to make up the difference as their economies slow .
this week standard &amp; poor &apos;s , the rating agency , ci@@ ted increasing household le@@ verage , mainly from rising mort@@ g@@ ages , as a risk factor for asian banks &quot; cred@@ it@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
it said that mal@@ ay@@ sia , thailand and sing@@ apor@@ e had the highest household debt to gross domestic product rati@@ os in asia .
mal@@ ay@@ sia top@@ ped the list at 80 per cent of gdp , up from 60 per cent in 2008 .
econom@@ ists are also wor@@ ried about high levels of consumer debt in thailand , which this week nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly emerged from technical recession .
on thursday , data showed continued export weak@@ ness , and a sof@@ ten@@ ing in consumer demand .
&quot; bottom line is that with costs rising , people in the middle to lower end &#91; of the income scale &#93; will be looking to supple@@ ment their income wherever they can , &quot; says song sen@@ g w@@ un , econom@@ ist at ci@@ mb , a mal@@ ay@@ sian bank .
histor@@ ically high prices for gold in the past two years have added to the rus@@ h to pa@@ wn personal belong@@ ings , as people take the opportunity to cash in the value of their family je@@ well@@ ery .
in sing@@ apor@@ e , about 70 per cent of items pa@@ w@@ ned at the cit@@ y-@@ state &apos;s 200 pa@@ wn out@@ lets are gold .
people are saying &quot; the gold price looks good , let &apos;s pa@@ wn grand@@ ma &apos;s gold chain and get it back next month .
in thailand the largest pa@@ wn@@ shop operator , eas@@ y@@ money , has seen an up to 20 per cent rise in the number of customers using its out@@ lets in recent months .
such is the growth in the pa@@ wn business that valu@@ em@@ a@@ x , operator of the out@@ let at ben@@ de@@ me@@ er and of 15 others like it in sing@@ apor@@ e , plans to expand not only in neighbouring mal@@ ay@@ sia - where it has four shops - but outside asia too , says ye@@ ah le@@ e ching , valu@@ em@@ a@@ x &apos;s executive director .
the company will fund that by using 60 per cent of s $ 6@@ 6@@ m it raised this week in a li@@ sting on the sing@@ apor@@ e stock exchange .

$ 3@@ 25@@ m rescue package for t@@ assi@@ e health
the federal government insi@@ sts a $ 3@@ 25 million rescue package for tas@@ man@@ ia &apos;s ail@@ ing health system has tough conditions attached that will ensure the state government can &apos;t waste the funds .
federal health minister t@@ any@@ a p@@ liber@@ se@@ k has announced the comm@@ on@@ wealth is taking &quot; urgent action &quot; to head off a crisis caused by the island state &apos;s aging population , higher rates of chr@@ onic disease and system constra@@ ints .
the funding , over four years , was decided after government consul@@ tations with tas@@ man@@ ian independent mp andre@@ w wil@@ ki@@ e .
&quot; the government has come up with an emergency rescue package we believe will address the unique challenges faced by the state , &quot; ms p@@ liber@@ se@@ k said today .
the $ 3@@ 25 million package includes a $ 31 million elec@@ tive sur@@ gery b@@ lit@@ z .
an additional 26@@ 00 operations including or@@ tho@@ pe@@ dic and cat@@ ar@@ act sur@@ gery will help clear a back@@ log .
there &apos;s also money for wal@@ k-@@ in clin@@ ics in ho@@ b@@ art and laun@@ ce@@ ston , better after@@ -@@ hospital care , medical specialist training , mental health services and the roll@@ out of personal electronic health record systems in local hospit@@ als .
&quot; these investments respond to the ideas that fron@@ t-@@ line clin@@ ici@@ ans have told me will be the best ways to tend to tas@@ man@@ ia &apos;s health system , &quot; ms p@@ liber@@ se@@ k said .
the minister insi@@ sted the tas@@ man@@ ian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime .
the state would have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive comm@@ on@@ wealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the extra funds .
a three-@@ person commission will be set up to ensure the state is deli@@ vering services as effectively and efficiently as possible .
mr wil@@ ki@@ e today said the $ 3@@ 25 million would count for little &quot; unless it &apos;s followed by genuine reform to put tas@@ man@@ ia &apos;s public health system on a more sustainable foot@@ ing . &quot;
he nevertheless p@@ raised the government for respon@@ ding to his request for urgent assistance which he first raised with the prime minister at the beginning of may .
&quot; i &apos;m hope@@ ful the federal assistance package will go a long way towards taking the state &apos;s public health system off the critical list , &quot; mr wil@@ ki@@ e said .
according to the state government these additional elec@@ tive procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts .
but federal opposition health spo@@ kes@@ man peter du@@ tt@@ on believes today &apos;s announcement is a &quot; b@@ and-@@ aid solution . &quot;
&quot; the reason we are here is that the labor state government ri@@ pped $ 4@@ 30 million out of its health system , &quot; he told ab@@ c tv .
you can &apos;t have a state government ri@@ pping out almost half-@@ a-@@ billion dollars and the comm@@ on@@ wealth put in $ 300 million and pre@@ tend it &apos;s a good news day .
mr du@@ tt@@ on called on ms p@@ liber@@ se@@ k to guarantee that not one dollar out of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .

syria has destroyed its chemical weapons making ability , wat@@ ch@@ dog group says
syria has destroyed critical equipment for producing chemical weapons and po@@ ison gas m@@ uni@@ tions , the global chemical weapons wat@@ ch@@ dog said thursday as fi@@ er@@ ce cl@@ ash@@ es r@@ aged in the country &apos;s north , close to one of the sites where tox@@ ic agents are believed to be stored .
also thursday , a sy@@ ri@@ an acti@@ vis@@ t group said more than 1@@ 20@@ ,000 people have been killed since the start of the country &apos;s civil war nearly three years ago .
the announcement by the organization for the prohibi@@ tion of chemical weapons came one day ahead of the no@@ v .
1 deadline set by the h@@ agu@@ e-@@ based organization for dam@@ as@@ c@@ us to destroy or &quot; ren@@ der in@@ oper@@ able &quot; all chemical weapon production facilities and machinery for mix@@ ing chemicals into po@@ ison gas and filling m@@ uni@@ tions .
the completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is a significant mil@@ est@@ one in an ambitious tim@@ el@@ ine that aims to destroy all of dam@@ as@@ c@@ us &apos; chemical weapons by mid-@@ 20@@ 14 .
destruction of the equipment means that syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .
however , dam@@ as@@ c@@ us still has to start destro@@ ying existing weapons and stock@@ pil@@ es .
the country is believed to have around 1@@ ,000 me@@ tric tons of chemicals and weapons including mu@@ st@@ ard gas and the ner@@ ve agent sar@@ in .
the announcement came as fighting r@@ aged thursday in the town of sa@@ fir@@ a , which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as storage sites , reported the brit@@ a@@ in-@@ based sy@@ ri@@ an observ@@ atory for human rights .
the acti@@ vis@@ t group , which has been tracking the death tol@@ l through a network of activi@@ sts in syria , said thursday that 1@@ 20@@ ,@@ 2@@ 96 people have died .
of those , it said 6@@ 1,@@ 0@@ 67 are civili@@ ans , including 6@@ ,@@ 3@@ 65 children .
on the government side , it said 2@@ 9@@ ,@@ 9@@ 54 are members of president bas@@ ha@@ r as@@ sad &apos;s armed forces , 18@@ ,@@ 6@@ 78 are pro-@@ government figh@@ ters and 18@@ 7 are leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah milit@@ ants .
also among the dead it said were 2,@@ 20@@ 2 army def@@ ec@@ tors and some 5@@ ,@@ 3@@ 75 opposition figh@@ ters , many of them foreign@@ ers .
on july 25 , the u.@@ n@@ . estimated 10@@ 0,000 have died in the conflict since march 2011 .
it has not updated that figure since .
the conflict has forced some 2 million people to fle@@ e the country .
as@@ sad &apos;s troops have been batt@@ ling re@@ be@@ ls , many of them linked to al-@@ q@@ a@@ id@@ a groups , in sa@@ fir@@ a for weeks .
the observ@@ atory said there were cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties on both sides thursday but had no specific@@ s .
the fighting under@@ sco@@ red the dangers the chemical weapons &apos; inspec@@ tors face as they race against tight dead@@ lines in their mission to rid syria of the tox@@ ic ar@@ sen@@ al in the mid@@ st of an ongoing civil war .
a statement from the op@@ c@@ w , which works closely with the united nations , said its team was &quot; now satisfied that it has veri@@ fied - and seen destroyed - all of syria &apos;s declared critical production and mix@@ ing / filling equipment . &quot;
it added that , &quot; no further inspection activities are currently planned . &quot;
earlier this week , the inspec@@ tors said they had completed their first round of veri@@ fication work , visiting 21 of 23 sites declared by dam@@ as@@ c@@ us .
they were unable to visit two sites because of security concerns , the inspec@@ tors said .
on thursday , op@@ c@@ w said the two locations were , according to syria , &quot; abandoned and ... the chemical weapons program items they contained were moved to other declared sites , which were in@@ sp@@ ected . &quot;
it was not immediately clear if the facility in sa@@ fir@@ a was one of the two sites that op@@ c@@ w inspec@@ tors were not able to visit .
syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons that has to be approved next month by the op@@ c@@ w &apos;s executive committee .
&quot; i sal@@ ute the for@@ titude and courage you &apos;ve all demonstrated in ful@@ filling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization , &quot; the wat@@ ch@@ dog &apos;s director@@ -@@ general , ah@@ met u@@ z@@ um@@ c@@ u , said in comments released by the op@@ c@@ w .
now in its third year , the civil war p@@ its the primarily sun@@ ni muslim re@@ be@@ ls against as@@ sad &apos;s government and its security forces , which are st@@ acked with members of his al@@ a@@ wit@@ e sec@@ t , an off@@ sho@@ ot of shi@@ ite islam .
in other developments , the observ@@ atory &apos;s chief ram@@ i ab@@ dur@@ ra@@ h@@ man said there had been a strong explo@@ sion wednesday inside an air defense facility in syria &apos;s coastal province of lat@@ ak@@ ia .
the cause of the b@@ last was not known , he said .
an@@ ger over bal@@ i bom@@ b p@@ lo@@ t@@ ter &apos;s sentence
survi@@ v@@ ors and rela@@ tives of the 20@@ 2 people killed in the 2002 bal@@ i bom@@ bing have re@@ acted with an@@ ger over the sentence given to the last of the p@@ lo@@ t@@ ters to face justice , saying u@@ mar pa@@ te@@ k should face a fir@@ ing squ@@ ad .
pa@@ te@@ k , who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of south-@@ east asia &apos;s most wanted , was yesterday sent@@ enced to 20 years in j@@ ail for his role in building the explo@@ sive devices used in the bom@@ bing .
he could be released within 15 years if granted par@@ o@@ le .
the 4@@ 5-@@ year-@@ old was found guil@@ ty of mass murder for the attack on two night@@ clubs in the popular tourist area of k@@ ut@@ a which left 20@@ 2 people dead , including 88 austr@@ ali@@ ans , and in@@ ju@@ red sco@@ res more .
he was also found guil@@ ty of a number of other terror@@ is@@ m-@@ related charges , including a wave of bom@@ b@@ ings of churches across indonesia on christmas eve in 2000 .
prosecu@@ tors had demanded a life sentence , although they could have pus@@ hed that the man du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; demo@@ lition man &quot; for his reputation as a master bom@@ b-@@ maker be sent@@ enced to death .
the decision has re@@ ign@@ ited pain@@ ful mem@@ ories for per@@ th mother june cor@@ teen , who lost her 3@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old twin dau@@ gh@@ ters jan@@ e and jen@@ ny in the destruction un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed by pa@@ te@@ k and his co-@@ con@@ spir@@ ators almost a decade ago .
fighting back te@@ ars , she said pa@@ te@@ k should have been sent@@ enced to death .
i really feel that he should follow in the foot@@ steps of the other gu@@ ys .
&quot; he should be put in front of the fir@@ ing squ@@ ad , &quot; ms cor@@ teen told a@@ ap .
i have to live every day without seeing more grand@@ children , and my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the sar@@ i club was lev@@ elled when a massive bom@@ b loaded into a van par@@ ked outside was de@@ ton@@ ated just after 11@@ pm on october 12 , 2002 .
peter hu@@ gh@@ es was in pad@@ dy &apos;s bar where a su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ ber de@@ ton@@ ated a back@@ pack loaded with explo@@ si@@ ves just 20 seconds earlier .
he lap@@ sed into a mon@@ th-@@ long com@@ a in the wake of the bom@@ bing , and &quot; died &quot; three times while on life support .
mr hu@@ gh@@ es said pa@@ te@@ k should have shared the same fate as three other members of the j@@ em@@ a@@ ah islam@@ i@@ ah terror cell responsible for the car@@ n@@ age - am@@ ro@@ zi , mu@@ kh@@ las and i@@ ma@@ m sam@@ u@@ dr@@ a - who were executed four years ago .
really , this gu@@ y should get the death penalty before any@@ body .
to keep him alive , well , there &apos;s no reason to keep him alive .
to get 20 years , after killing 20@@ 2 people and in@@ j@@ uring many hundreds , it &apos;s not much .
pa@@ te@@ k is the last of the bal@@ i bom@@ bers to face justice .
he had avoided capture for almost a decade but was eventually ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended in january 2011 in the pa@@ ki@@ stan@@ i town of ab@@ bot@@ tab@@ ad , where us forces killed former al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a chief os@@ ama b@@ in la@@ den less than four months later .
during the trial , an f@@ bi agent testi@@ fied that intelligence reports had revealed pa@@ te@@ k was in pakistan to meet with b@@ in la@@ den in an effort to re-@@ establish links between south-@@ east asian terrorist groups and al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a .
&quot; he didn &apos;t give himself up , &quot; ms cor@@ teen said .
until just recently , he really didn &apos;t feel sorry for how much gri@@ ef he caused other people .
the ver@@ dic@@ t comes ahead of the 10@@ th anniversary of the attack later this year , which will be marked by cere@@ mon@@ ies in bal@@ i and australia .
&quot; there will be a lot of te@@ ars this year , &quot; ms cor@@ teen said .

fa@@ a : air passengers can now use g@@ ad@@ gets on plan@@ es ( but not make cell phone calls )
airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices ga@@ te@@ -to-@@ gate to read , work , play games , watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their cell@@ phones - under mu@@ ch-@@ anticip@@ ated new guidelines issued thursday by the federal aviation administration .
but passengers shoul@@ dn &apos;t expect changes to happen immediately .
how fast the change is implemented will vary by the airline , fa@@ a administr@@ ator michael hu@@ er@@ ta said at a news conference .
airlines will have to show the fa@@ a how their air@@ plan@@ es meet the new guidelines and that they &apos;ve up@@ dating their flight crew training manu@@ als and rules for sto@@ wing devices to reflect the new guidelines .
the fa@@ a said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of port@@ able electronic devices on plan@@ es .
del@@ ta and j@@ et@@ blue were among the air@@ lin@@ ers who have already submitted plans .
&quot; depending on the condition of the plan , we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon , &quot; the fa@@ a said in a statement .
currently , passengers are required to turn off their smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices once a plane &apos;s door clo@@ ses .
they &apos;re not supposed to re@@ start them until the plan@@ es reach 10@@ ,000 feet and the captain gives the go@@ -@@ ahead .
passengers are supposed to turn their devices off again as the plane des@@ cen@@ ds to land and not re@@ start them until the plane is on the ground .
under the new guidelines , airlines whose plan@@ es are properly protected from electronic inter@@ ference may allow passengers to use the devices during take@@ off@@ s , land@@ ings and ta@@ xi@@ ing , the fa@@ a said .
most new air@@ lin@@ ers and other plan@@ es that have been modified so that passengers can use wifi at higher al@@ titu@@ des are expected to meet the criteria .
la@@ ura gl@@ ading , president of the association of professional flight att@@ end@@ ants , welcomed the changes .
&quot; once the new policy is safe@@ ly implemented - and we &apos;re going to work closely with the carrier to do that - it will be a win@@ -@@ win , &quot; gl@@ ading said in a statement .
we &apos;re frank@@ ly ti@@ red of feeling like &apos; hall monit@@ ors &apos; when it comes to this issue .
but connecting to the internet to sur@@ f , exchange em@@ ail@@ s , text or download data will still be prohibited below 10@@ ,000 feet , the agency said .
passengers will be told to switch their smar@@ t@@ phones , tab@@ lets and other devices to air@@ plane mode .
so , still no words with friends , the online scr@@ ab@@ b@@ le-@@ type game that actor al@@ ec bal@@ d@@ win was playing on his smar@@ t@@ phone in 2011 when he was fam@@ ously boo@@ ted off an american airlines jet for ref@@ using to turn off the device while the plane was par@@ ked at the gate .
and he@@ avi@@ er devices such as lap@@ top@@ s will continue to have to be sto@@ wed because of concern they might in@@ j@@ ure someone if they go flying around the cab@@ in .
in-@@ flight cell@@ phone calls also will continue to be prohibited .
regulatory authority over phone calls belongs to the federal communications commission , not the fa@@ a .
fa@@ a may lift ban on some electronic devices during take@@ off and lan@@ ding
last month , national transportation safety board mark ro@@ sen@@ ker , a c@@ bs news national transportation safety expert , said that cell phones are still considered a risk .
&quot; cell phones , that really is an issue , not just because potentially it could create inter@@ ference with na@@ vi@@ ga@@ tional devices , but we do know , according to the f@@ cc , that it could inter@@ f@@ ere with cell phone to@@ wers when they &apos;re in the air , &quot; ro@@ sen@@ ker said .
an industry advisory committee created by the fa@@ a to examine the issue recommended last month that the government permit greater use of personal electronic devices .
pressure has been building on the fa@@ a in recent years to ease restrictions on their use .
cri@@ tics such as sen@@ . cla@@ ire mc@@ cas@@ kill , d-@@ mo . , cont@@ end there is no valid safety reason for the prohibi@@ tions .
the restrictions have also become increasingly difficult to en@@ force as use of the devices has become u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
some studies indicate as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore directions to turn off their devices .
the fa@@ a began restric@@ ting passengers &apos; use of electronic devices in 196@@ 6 in response to reports of inter@@ ference with navigation and communications equipment when passengers began carrying f@@ m radi@@ os , the high-@@ tech g@@ ad@@ gets of their day .
new air@@ lin@@ ers are far more reli@@ ant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the fa@@ a to be resistant to electronic inter@@ ference .
airlines have been offering wi-fi use at cru@@ ising al@@ titu@@ des to passengers for several years .
plan@@ es modified for wi-fi systems are also more resistant to inter@@ ference .
the vast majority of air@@ lin@@ ers should quali@@ fy for greater electronic device use under the new guidelines , hu@@ er@@ ta said .
today &apos;s electronic devices generally em@@ it much lower power radio trans@@ missions than previous generations of devices .
e-@@ read@@ ers , for example , em@@ it only minimal trans@@ missions when turning a page .
but trans@@ missions are stronger when devices are downloading or sending data .
among those pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on passengers &apos; use of the devices has been amaz@@ on@@ .@@ com@@ .
in 2011 , company officials loaded an air@@ lin@@ er full of their kin@@ dle e-@@ read@@ ers and fle@@ w it around to test for problems but found none .
fa@@ a advisory committee members expressed mixed feel@@ ings about whether use of the devices presents any risk .
dou@@ gl@@ as kid@@ d of the national association of airline passengers said he believes inter@@ ference from the devices is genuine even if the risk is minimal .
other committee members said there are only an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ al reports from pil@@ ots to support that the devices can inter@@ f@@ ere with aircraft systems , and most of those reports are very old .
however , the committee recommended the fa@@ a allow pil@@ ots to order passengers to sh@@ ut off devices during instrument land@@ ings in low vi@@ sibility .
a travel industry group welcomed the changes , calling them comm@@ on-@@ sense accommo@@ dations for a trav@@ eling public now bri@@ st@@ ling with technology .
&quot; we &apos;re pleased the fa@@ a recogn@@ iz@@ es that an enjoy@@ able passenger experience is not in@@ compatible with safety and security , &quot; said ro@@ ger do@@ w , ceo of the u.s. travel association .

is europe &apos;s elite ready to do business with britain ?
business for britain launched in april with a ple@@ dge to bring business together and define what the uk &apos;s wealth and job cre@@ ators want to see changed in our relationship with the eu .
to that end , we commission@@ ed the largest and most comprehensive po@@ ll of british business leaders asking them for their thoughts on britain , business and the eu .
you@@ go@@ v pol@@ led over 1@@ ,000 business leaders , broad@@ ly representative of britain &apos;s business sizes , sectors and regions .
the conclusions of the po@@ ll will come as a surprise to many .
we found that the vast majority of businesses are now looking to export outside of europe , focusing on countries that are modern@@ ising and growing while the eu states stag@@ n@@ ate .
they want to see the government pri@@ ori@@ tise new trading links with the li@@ kes of china , india and brazil , rather than getting bo@@ gged down in the long and ar@@ du@@ ous process of re@@ forming the eu &apos;s ar@@ can@@ e institutions .
when asked their views on specific policy areas - ranging from monopo@@ ly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders thought that control of these key competences should be returned to west@@ min@@ ster .
there was general dis@@ content with the single market , with businesses saying that the costs of brussels regulation now out@@ weigh@@ ed the benefits of being part of europe &apos;s trading area - even 40 per cent of large businesses , tradi@@ tionally the most pro@@ -european of companies , agreed .
finally , and most tell@@ ingly of all , our po@@ ll of business leaders found a clear majority wanted to see britain pursue a course of treaty change and a relationship with the eu that is based on trade , not politics .
this finding , which was reflected across the sizes and major business groups , shows that business is pus@@ hing for a &quot; meaning@@ ful change &quot; that brings powers back to the uk .
the sta@@ kes are high - achieving treaty change and a better deal for britain sees a 16 per cent sw@@ ing towards voting to stay in the eu in a referendum .
the prime minister should be in no doubt : this po@@ ll shows that british business backs his plan for re@@ negotiating the terms of britain &apos;s membership of the eu .
it also shows that business exp@@ ects that re@@ negotiation to make a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the uk .
a better deal for british business is possible , and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embar@@ ks on the road to closer economic and fiscal union .
the priority must be jobs and growth in britain and , as the findings of our po@@ ll show , for business this means a renewed focus on trade and a fundamental change in brussels &quot; regulatory approach .
ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m &apos;s alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er says pipel@@ ine in bulgaria starts new gas era
the start of construction of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine in bulgaria marks the launch of one of europe &apos;s largest energy projects , ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m &apos;s chief said .
&quot; a land@@ mark event has taken place today : construction started on the bulg@@ arian section of the south stream gas pipel@@ ine , the most large-scale and important project in europe , &quot; ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m chairman alex@@ e@@ i mill@@ er said in a statement thursday .
this project is a key element of energy security of the whole european continent .
south stream is meant to add diversity to russia &apos;s export routes through europe .
a contractual dispute between ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m and its counter@@ parts in ukraine , which hosts most of russia &apos;s gas for europe , adds a layer of risk to conventional routes , officials say .
mill@@ er said the direct connection to bulgaria , a member of the european union , means geo@@ political risks associated with transit countries are elimin@@ ated &quot; fore@@ ver . &quot;
bulg@@ arian consumers will receive gas from south stream at a dis@@ coun@@ ted rate once the entire project starts operating in 20@@ 15 .
ga@@ z@@ pro@@ m said construction should begin in other down@@ stream countries by year &apos;s end .
the pipel@@ ine is designed for an annual capacity of 2.@@ 2 tr@@ il@@ lion cu@@ b@@ ic feet of natural gas .

he conce@@ ded the y@@ m@@ ca &apos;s opening statement to the commission was also in@@ accurate in claim@@ ing &quot; there have been external aud@@ its of the y@@ m@@ ca that have recognised the y@@ m@@ ca as being at the fore@@ front of child safety . &quot;
evidence before the commission is that y@@ m@@ ca was notified that it received the second lowest of four possible rat@@ ings in a department of education and communities quality audit in august this year .
mr h@@ are , who started with the y@@ m@@ ca when he was 21 , conce@@ ded management &quot; from myself down &quot; failed by recru@@ iting lord and failed to make sure staff were clear about their obligations to report child safe policy bre@@ aches .
earlier this year lord was convic@@ ted for sexual off@@ ences against 12 bo@@ ys during the two years he worked at the y@@ m@@ ca .
he was j@@ ail@@ ed for a minimum of six years .
but mr h@@ are rejected the suggestion the y@@ m@@ ca had a cultural problem which prevented staff from reporting lord &apos;s bre@@ aches of child safety .
staff gave evidence they observed bre@@ aches including lord being alone with children , bab@@ y@@ sitting them priv@@ ately , having them sit on his la@@ p , saying he loved one and le@@ tting them play with his mobile phone .
dani@@ elle oc@@ k@@ well , who was supervis@@ ed by lord and asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour , testi@@ fied she found the y@@ m@@ ca car@@ ing@@ ba@@ h children &apos;s services manager j@@ acqu@@ i bar@@ n@@ at who supervis@@ ed lord &quot; very in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ating and hard to approach a lot of the time . &quot;
the ceo said he did not accept staff &apos;s evidence that they were un@@ comfortable with reporting up@@ wards to their managers .
rather , he said , their friend@@ ships with lord cl@@ ou@@ ded their jud@@ g@@ ements about reporting him .
mr h@@ are said he had provided his view to the y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w board that the lesson for the organisation from the &quot; jon@@ a@@ than lord incident &quot; was &quot; not about reporting &quot; by staff , and the board agreed with him .
mr h@@ are said the decision to get staff to sign confid@@ enti@@ ality agreements soon after the alleg@@ ations emerged was made by y@@ m@@ ca general manager of children &apos;s services li@@ am wh@@ it@@ ley .
he said it was intended to avoid contam@@ ination of evidence but was &quot; over@@ ze@@ al@@ ous &quot; and po@@ or@@ ly executed .
y@@ m@@ ca n@@ s@@ w was not a child safe organisation at the time jon@@ a@@ than lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , child sex abuse expert professor ste@@ ph@@ en small@@ bone of gri@@ ff@@ ith university told the commission .
he said there were &quot; serious problems &quot; in recru@@ it@@ ment , scre@@ ening , in@@ duc@@ tion , training and supervision of staff .
the hearing ad@@ jour@@ ned until december 20 .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir said he &apos;d se@@ ize the chance to return as britain &apos;s prime minister - but acknowled@@ ges a com@@ e@@ back is unlikely .
in an interview over@@ night to mark the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 5@@ 9-@@ year-@@ old ai@@ red his views on various domestic policies .
since he stood down in june 2007 after a decade as leader , mr bla@@ ir has largely avoided discussing british politics , con@@ fin@@ ing most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as en@@ vo@@ y to the quar@@ tet of middle east peac@@ em@@ ak@@ ers .
asked if he would return to the post of prime minister , mr bla@@ ir was quo@@ ted by london &apos;s evening standard as saying : &quot; yes , sure , but it &apos;s not likely to happen is it , so ... &quot;
as crow@@ ds of hor@@ se@@ -@@ showing experts gathered in car@@ di@@ ff to battle it out for horse of the year , they knew the competition would be tough .
but nobody was quite ready for three-@@ year-@@ old f@@ ent@@ on kir@@ k@@ land .
not yet in school and just months on from taking his first steps , the to@@ d@@ d@@ ler and his pet sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y to@@ ff@@ ee tro@@ t@@ ted through the three roun@@ ds with ease to take the top prize - leaving their 30 adult oppon@@ ents tra@@ iling behind .
the in@@ separ@@ able pair - who are the same height - were comm@@ ended for appearance , behaviour and style at the annual contest run by sun@@ ny@@ bank equ@@ e@@ strian centre , in ru@@ dry near car@@ di@@ ff .
taking to the stage against men and women in smart bow@@ ler h@@ ats , he ti@@ pped his flat cap at a ja@@ un@@ ty angle and par@@ aded two-@@ year-@@ old to@@ ff@@ ee around the ring .
f@@ ent@@ on was lau@@ ded by jud@@ ges for natural handling skills well beyond his years .
and to@@ ff@@ ee received top marks for his appearance and person@@ ality .
f@@ ent@@ on was given to@@ ff@@ ee as a third birth@@ day present last march and has practi@@ sed with the sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y every day since .
his mother don@@ na , 30 , said : &quot; f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee are a great double act . &quot;
they were up against all com@@ ers but the two of them wal@@ ked off with the gold cup and ro@@ set@@ te .
it was only the second time he had compe@@ ted with to@@ ff@@ ee and we were all ec@@ sta@@ tic when he won .
complete str@@ ang@@ ers in the arena all thought he was so phenomen@@ al they wanted photos taken with him .
the youn@@ g@@ ster , from the village of nan@@ ty@@ gl@@ o , near e@@ bb@@ w val@@ e , south wal@@ es , is following in the foot@@ steps of his a@@ un@@ t shar@@ on ho@@ wel@@ ls , who has been showing horses for more than 10 years .
mrs ho@@ wel@@ ls said : &quot; the whole place was electric and everybody was che@@ ering and cla@@ pping . &quot;
he was running on sand down the full length of the arena and even though he looked so tiny he did a mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous job .
f@@ ent@@ on is animal ma@@ d - he lo@@ ves horses , trac@@ tors and farms and has got two ch@@ ick@@ ens which he looks after .
the way he has started he &apos;ll be at the horse of the year show before long - and i &apos;m sure he &apos;ll do well .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the annual horse show said : &quot; f@@ ent@@ on is only three but he knows how to handle his pon@@ y . &quot;
they are a great team together .
the jud@@ ges marked f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee on how well they were turned out and the way they presented in the show ring .
they look for good te@@ am@@ work between the pon@@ y and the hand@@ ler - f@@ ent@@ on and to@@ ff@@ ee were the best in the ring .
i &apos;m sure f@@ ent@@ on was helped by his cu@@ te clothes , he really looked the part .
china ple@@ a paper &apos; to be over@@ hau@@ le@@ d@@ &apos;
a chinese newspaper that made a fron@@ t-@@ page appeal for the release of a re@@ porter accused of de@@ fam@@ ation is to be over@@ ha@@ ul@@ ed , a press regul@@ ator says .
the gu@@ ang@@ z@@ hou@@ -based new express made a rare public ple@@ a for the release of journ@@ alist chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
but mr chen subsequently ad@@ mitted on television that he had taken bri@@ bes to fabric@@ ate stories about a part state@@ -@@ owned company .
now the new express is to under@@ go &quot; full rec@@ ti@@ fication , &quot; the regul@@ ator said .
the &quot; rec@@ ti@@ fication &quot; order came from the gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong administration of press and publication , radio , film and television .
a preliminary investigation showed that y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group &apos;s new express had published several un@@ true reports about listed company zo@@ om@@ lion in the period of september 2012 to august 2013 .
&quot; new express &apos;s ed@@ it@@ orial management was dis@@ ordered , &quot; the regul@@ ator said in a statement .
it said it had decided to &quot; impose an administrative penalty on chen y@@ ong@@ z@@ ho@@ u by re@@ vo@@ king his re@@ porter &apos;s license . &quot;
it had also &quot; instruc@@ ted y@@ ang@@ chen@@ g evening news group to undertake a complete rec@@ ti@@ fication of new express , and recommended they investigate the relevant responsible persons at new express and immediately rev@@ ise new express &apos;s leadership team . &quot;
mr chen wrote several articles for the new express alleg@@ ing financial ir@@ regul@@ arities at a construc@@ tion-@@ equipment company called zo@@ om@@ lion .
after he was de@@ tained , his newspaper published two fron@@ t-@@ page appe@@ als for his release , saying it backed his journ@@ alism .
but mr chen then appeared on state television ad@@ mitting he had published false stories for money .
&quot; in this case i &apos;ve caused damages to zo@@ om@@ lion and also the whole news media industry and its ability to earn the public &apos;s trust , &quot; he told state broad@@ cas@@ ter c@@ c@@ tv .
i did this mainly because i han@@ ke@@ red after money and f@@ ame .
i &apos;ve re@@ alised my wr@@ ong@@ doing .
following mr chen &apos;s apo@@ logy , new express issued a fron@@ t-@@ page apo@@ logy , saying it had failed to properly check his reports .
several high-@@ profile susp@@ ects have made tele@@ vised conf@@ essions recently .
experts say conf@@ essions are still rout@@ inely co@@ er@@ ced , despite a change in the law earlier this year ban@@ ning the authorities from forcing anyone to inc@@ ri@@ min@@ ate themselves .
us@@ -@@ mexico drug tunnel with its own railway found
one of the most sophisticated drug s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ling tun@@ nels between the usa and mexico has been found , complete with its own lighting , v@@ enti@@ lation and electric rail systems .
us authorities described the four foot by three foot tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret pass@@ ages they have ever discovered .
the tunnel , which zi@@ g@@ z@@ ag@@ s the length of nearly six football pit@@ ches , links ware@@ houses near ti@@ ju@@ ana , mexico and san di@@ e@@ go , usa .
the area is filled with non@@ descri@@ pt ware@@ houses , making it easier to conce@@ al tr@@ uc@@ ks being loaded with drugs .
the tunnel was sh@@ ut down before any drugs made it through un@@ detec@@ ted , authorities said .
authorities se@@ ized eigh@@ t-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half tons of mari@@ ju@@ ana and 3@@ 27 p@@ ounds of co@@ ca@@ ine in connection with the tunnel &apos;s discovery , according to court records .
three men who authorities say worked as drivers were charged with pos@@ session of mari@@ ju@@ ana and co@@ ca@@ ine with int@@ ent to distribute .
they face prison sent@@ ences between 10 years and life imprison@@ ment if convic@@ ted .
in no@@ gal@@ es , ari@@ z@@ ona , s@@ mu@@ gg@@ lers ta@@ p into vast underground dra@@ in@@ age can@@ als .
the tunnel is the eigh@@ th major pass@@ age discovered in san di@@ e@@ go since 2006 .
some of the largest tun@@ nels have been discovered after central mexico &apos;s mari@@ ju@@ ana har@@ v@@ est in october , which presents drug car@@ te@@ ls with a challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers .
in 2010 , authorities found a roughly 7@@ 00@@ -@@ yard pass@@ age equipped with rail tracks that extended from the kitchen of a ti@@ ju@@ ana home to two san di@@ e@@ go ware@@ houses .
or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and mir@@ anda ker@@ r still love each other
actors or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om and model mir@@ anda ker@@ r want to go their separate ways .
however , in an interview , blo@@ om has said that he and ker@@ r still love each other .
mir@@ anda ker@@ r and or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om are parents to two-@@ year-@@ old fl@@ y@@ n@@ n .
actor or@@ lan@@ do blo@@ om announced his separation from his wife , super@@ model mir@@ anda ker@@ r .
in an interview with us journ@@ alist k@@ ati@@ e cou@@ ric , which is to be broad@@ cast on friday ( local time ) , blo@@ om said , &quot; sometimes life doesn &apos;t go exactly as we plan or hope for &quot; .
he and ker@@ r still love each other , emphasised the 3@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old .
&quot; we &apos;re going to support one another and love each other as parents to fl@@ y@@ n@@ n &quot; .
ker@@ r and blo@@ om have been married since 20@@ 10@@ . their son fl@@ y@@ n@@ n was born in 2011 .
according to dic@@ tion@@ aries , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a sub-@@ category of vege@@ tari@@ an@@ ism , yet the two do differ considerably .
for while vege@@ tari@@ ans allow themselves to con@@ sume cre@@ am tar@@ ts , ice cre@@ am or a strong ed@@ am , these in@@ dul@@ g@@ ences are off the menu for ve@@ g@@ ans .
milk , cheese , eg@@ g - alongside avoiding meat and fish , ve@@ g@@ ans ref@@ rain from eating all products of animal origin - even hon@@ ey is not permitted .
you might ask what is left , however , upon closer inspection the world of ve@@ gan nutri@@ tion is characterised by great res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
&quot; spre@@ ads are very popular , &quot; explained ute hen@@ kel@@ mann the owner of the local health food store , which provides a host of special products for ve@@ g@@ ans .
re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor also li@@ kes to visit the store on &quot; dom@@ gas@@ se &quot; .
the new ze@@ al@@ ander has been ve@@ gan for 13 years , and in lam@@ per@@ the@@ im he can find ( almost ) everything that he needs to get by . &quot; in 1997 i adjusted my di@@ et and became a vege@@ t@@ arian &quot; .
at the turn of the millennium i took the next step and became ve@@ gan .
&quot; however , it was@@ n &apos;t just the di@@ et that convinced me , but also my choice of shoes , &quot; said proc@@ tor , who pre@@ fers artificial leather over normal leather .
he re@@ alised that you can also overcome all other daily concerns without animal products .
first and foremost , being ve@@ gan is a matter of eth@@ ics .
&quot; i don &apos;t want animals to have to die for me , &quot; said proc@@ tor , expressing the ma@@ xi@@ m of ve@@ g@@ ans , which applies to all their consumer behaviour .
rather than missing bur@@ gers , scr@@ amb@@ led e@@ gg@@ s or gu@@ m@@ mi bears , the ve@@ gan has quickly discovered entirely new products that really in@@ sp@@ ire him .
&quot; it is a double bonus , &quot; says proc@@ tor now , &quot; in actual fact being ve@@ gan is not about doing without , it &apos;s not about as@@ ce@@ tic@@ ism , but rather it is an enh@@ anc@@ ement &quot; . regarding the as@@ sumption that when you convert your di@@ et you are reducing your choice of meal options , proc@@ tor puts this down to force of hab@@ it .
and it is precisely this conditioning that results in many a well-@@ inten@@ tioned attempt failing .
&quot; the temp@@ tation factor is a decisive factor in causing many to quickly give up , similar to with smoking , &quot; says proc@@ tor , providing a comparison .
and he argu@@ es : &quot; certain flav@@ ours are not linked to animal produce &quot; .
often it is the her@@ bs or the type of preparation that provide the flav@@ our .
&quot; you can , however , create the same effect in other ways , &quot; explains the ve@@ gan .
for example , when atten@@ ding a bar@@ bec@@ ue party , proc@@ tor brings au@@ ber@@ gin@@ es , mus@@ h@@ rooms and also a few ve@@ gan sa@@ us@@ ages .
he ensures a balanced , varied di@@ et , whereby everything should also have a good hear@@ ty flav@@ our .
of course you want to have something with a bit of b@@ ite , that is fair enough .
&quot; it should be ta@@ sty , but this doesn &apos;t necessarily mean anim@@ al-@@ based food , &quot; said proc@@ tor .
he has not suffered any damage to his health or eating dis@@ orders - another wide@@ -@@ spread as@@ sumption .
conver@@ ting has had a positive effect for me .
i do not con@@ sume any foreign cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol and have increased my vit@@ am@@ in in@@ take .
there are top athle@@ tes who also have an exclusively ve@@ gan di@@ et .
&quot; my blood values are excellent - i have myself checked on a regular basis , &quot; revealed proc@@ tor .
many cri@@ tics of ve@@ gan@@ ism war@@ n in particular of the lack of vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 .
&quot; because animals are fed on fo@@ d@@ der instead of gra@@ zing , it is du@@ bi@@ ous whether the vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 content in meat sold in free@@ z@@ ers is actually high , &quot; comm@@ ented proc@@ tor .
for ve@@ g@@ ans there is also the option of taking the co-@@ en@@ zy@@ me in the form of tab@@ lets .
&quot; my b@@ 12 values are fine , &quot; he explained .
proc@@ tor does not have to travel far to buy food .
there are basic food@@ stuffs available everywhere , and every super@@ market now has so@@ ya milk and other products .
i can find everything i need loc@@ ally .
i only purchase special items now and again .
&quot; many people over@@ look the fact that even though read@@ y-@@ made ve@@ gan products are expensive , it is well-known that this is also the case for &quot; normal &quot; read@@ y-@@ made products .
in any case , the preparation of ve@@ gan dishes is much cheaper and less time consum@@ ing than commonly assumed .
&quot; in home cooking , there is much to be discovered - with a few minor t@@ wea@@ ks you can achieve good , if not sometimes better results , &quot; said proc@@ tor .
mar@@ gar@@ ine in place of but@@ ter , a little more ba@@ king pow@@ der and bic@@ ar@@ bon@@ ate of so@@ da in place of eg@@ g - proc@@ tor has even managed to ast@@ on@@ ish his in-@@ laws with his ve@@ gan cheese ca@@ kes .
the ve@@ gan adds new sp@@ ice to family parties .
when you co@@ ok together there is a certain dynamic - cooking takes on new value .
&quot; the situations that may arise are as varied as the people themselves , &quot; said proc@@ tor .
of course he has already met with s@@ cep@@ tic@@ ism .
do you not like my food any more ?
&quot; should i feel bad now because i drink milk ? &quot; - as a ve@@ gan you have to be tac@@ t@@ ful in such matters .
&quot; i do not dis@@ approve of people , i am part of this society , &quot; said proc@@ tor , expla@@ ining that he was not choosing a life of isolation .
and on closer observation , the everyday world does not appear quite so &apos; un@@ -@@ ve@@ gan &apos; - and ve@@ g@@ ans are not quite as limited in their everyday lives as is commonly assumed .
fast food is also permitted .
chi@@ ps are available everywhere !
&quot; many don@@ er ke@@ ba@@ b houses offer fal@@ a@@ fe@@ l , or even vege@@ t@@ arian yu@@ f@@ ka , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
in a piz@@ zer@@ ia he avoi@@ ds pa@@ sta dishes or just orders a piz@@ za without cheese , all just a question of hab@@ it .
restaurants are slowly adap@@ ting to things .
&quot; when i began eating a ve@@ gan di@@ et 13 years ago , things were even more difficult , &quot; says the new ze@@ al@@ ander , and he points out : &quot; you have to talk with people , make them aware &quot; .
&quot; if enough requests are made , they will perhaps be inc@@ lined to expand their men@@ us , &quot; he hopes .
there are ve@@ gan restaurants opening up , such as the kom@@ b@@ ü@@ se in man@@ n@@ heim or café vo@@ gel@@ fre@@ i .
proc@@ tor hopes that other restaurants will also have at least one ve@@ gan dish on the menu .
essentially , ve@@ gan dishes are for everyone .
anyone can eat them , they are the exact opposite of exclusive .
&quot; meat dishes , on the other hand , are exclusive , in the tru@@ est sense of the word , as they rule others out , &quot; assess@@ ed proc@@ tor .
&quot; if you want to avoid food scand@@ als , ve@@ gan@@ ism is a safe way to rule out the majority of scand@@ als from the outset , &quot; says proc@@ tor .
however , purchasing ve@@ gan products can be difficult to start with .
o@@ ince you come to understand that pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts , in particular , may also contain animal addi@@ tives as a colour@@ ant , people seem to quickly lose courage when following a code of eth@@ ics with so many hur@@ d@@ les and pit@@ falls .
therefore , for this reason and others , re@@ u@@ ben proc@@ tor and lars th@@ om@@ sen have written a book . &quot; ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - ti@@ er@@ is@@ che in@@ hal@@ ts@@ st@@ off@@ e und i@@ h@@ re alterna@@ ti@@ ven &quot; ( ve@@ gan@@ is@@ sim@@ o - animal ingredients and their alternatives ) explains the many ingredients hidden in both food@@ stuffs and cleaning agents .
&quot; you gradually develop an internal scan@@ ner and you know which symb@@ ols and lo@@ gos you have to look out for &quot; . proc@@ tor has learned that &quot; it is sometimes better too take small steps rather than to stand still or st@@ um@@ ble &quot; .
ve@@ gan@@ ism is an important moral comp@@ ass , which has an effect on your consci@@ ousness .
perhaps he won &apos;t manage to help you break old hab@@ its al@@ together , but at least he man@@ ages to te@@ ach consumers to cri@@ tically question their hab@@ its .
stock exchange operator nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x keeps its customers on ten@@ ter@@ ho@@ o@@ ks .
trading at the nas@@ da@@ q options market was inter@@ rup@@ ted on friday afternoon , german time .
in an announcement , the operator ci@@ ted technical problems as the reason .
on the other ele@@ ven options markets , including two also operated by nas@@ da@@ q om@@ x , business continued as normal .
the most recent incident is the latest in a series of both small and large break@@ down@@ s suffered by the stock exchange operator .
as recently as last tuesday , the nas@@ da@@ q in@@ d@@ ices were not calculated for one hour due to data transfer errors .
in august of this year there were two break@@ down@@ s in a single week .
first of all , us investment bank gol@@ d@@ man s@@ ach@@ s sent large quantities of incorrec@@ t purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems .
as a result , the stock exchange operators required almost an entire day to look through and delete the orders .
two days later , half of all stock dealing in the usa came to a stand@@ still for several hours , due to a computer failure in the nas@@ da@@ q exchange .
furthermore , last year the li@@ sting of fac@@ e@@ book on the stock exchange caused quite a fur@@ ore .
the nas@@ da@@ q systems could not cope with the flo@@ od of purchase and sales orders , the exchange supervisory authority established at a later date , imposing a record penalty of 10 million dollars on the company .

british police serve ass@@ ange with ex@@ tradition notice
b@@ ti@@ tish police served an ex@@ tradition notice today on wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks founder ju@@ lian ass@@ ange , who has taken refu@@ ge in ecu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in london and requested asylum .
scotland yard said they had served a &quot; sur@@ ren@@ der notice &quot; on the 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old austr@@ ali@@ an requiring him to appear at a police station , adding that failure to do so would make him further liable to arrest .
ass@@ ange faces ex@@ tradition to sweden over sex crime alleg@@ ations , having exhaus@@ ted his options under british law when the supreme court over@@ turned his appeal against ex@@ tradition earlier this month .
fe@@ aring stockholm would pass him on to the us , he sought refu@@ ge at ecu@@ ador &apos;s emb@@ ass@@ y in london on june 19 , asking the south american country for political asylum .
scotland yard has &quot; served a sur@@ ren@@ der notice upon a 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old man that requires him to attend a police station at date and time of our choosing , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ man said .
he remains in breach of his ba@@ il conditions .
the emb@@ ass@@ y dec@@ lined to comment on the serving of the police notice .
ass@@ ange fears he will be ex@@ tradi@@ ted from sweden to the united states to face possible es@@ pi@@ on@@ age charges , after rele@@ asing more than 2@@ 50@@ ,000 us diplomatic cab@@ les on the wi@@ kil@@ ea@@ ks anti-@@ sec@@ rec@@ y website .

tax on foreign property owners to bur@@ st london &apos;s bu@@ b@@ ble
the treas@@ ury have provi@@ sion@@ ally co@@ sted out the c@@ g@@ t measure but are awa@@ iting a final decision from mr os@@ borne , who , in the 2012 budget , introduced a 7 % rate of st@@ amp duty for homes co@@ sting more than £ 2@@ m and annual charges for bu@@ yers who choose to hold homes in a company rather than as individuals .
already the st@@ amp duty take for residential property in the bor@@ ough@@ s of west@@ min@@ ster and ken@@ sing@@ ton &amp; ch@@ el@@ sea , which stood at £ 7@@ 08 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , exce@@ eds the combined total for northern ireland , wal@@ es , scotland , the north east , north west and yor@@ k@@ sh@@ ire and the hum@@ ber put together .
mr co@@ ok said : &quot; following increases in st@@ amp duty of high value homes and the introduction of associated anti-@@ avo@@ idance legislation , it is very difficult to argue that high value property is under@@ -@@ tax@@ ed ir@@ respective of the effect of the out@@ -@@ dated council tax system . &quot;
&quot; but this move could make some foreign investors re@@ tic@@ ent to buy property in london or current owners re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant to sell , &quot; he added .
prime property - the top 5 % to 10 % of the housing market by price - in the aff@@ lu@@ ent south-@@ west london bel@@ t , which stret@@ ches from ful@@ ham to w@@ im@@ ble@@ don , has increased by a record 11.@@ 8 % over the past year .
prices in central london continued to show stead@@ y year-@@ on-@@ year growth of 5.@@ 6 % but were over@@ sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ ed by a bur@@ ge@@ oning &quot; domestic market &quot; with the city &apos;s south west , north ( 7.@@ 4 % ) and east ( 6.@@ 5 % ) all experiencing an up@@ tic@@ k , according to research from sa@@ vill@@ s .
scientists have sh@@ ed more light on how the movements of a dog &apos;s tail are linked to its mo@@ od .
earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wa@@ g their tails more to the right ( from the dog &apos;s point of view ) , while ner@@ vous dogs have a lef@@ t-@@ dominated sw@@ ish .
but now scientists say that fellow can@@ ines can spot and respond to these sub@@ tle tail differences .
pr@@ of geor@@ gio v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a , a neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ enti@@ st from the university of tren@@ to , said : &quot; it is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimul@@ i that invo@@ kes positive or negative emo@@ tions . &quot;
here we attemp@@ ted to look at it in other species .
he added that just as in humans , for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for lef@@ t-@@ handed movement and vice vers@@ a , and the two h@@ emis@@ p@@ he@@ res played different roles in emo@@ tions .
to find out more about how dogs react to the lo@@ p-@@ sid@@ ed tail wag@@ s of other dogs , the researchers monitored the animals as they wat@@ ched films of other dogs .
they measured the pe@@ ts &apos; heart rates and analy@@ sed their behaviour .
it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other
pr@@ of v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said : &quot; we presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a natur@@ alistic version or a sil@@ hou@@ ette to get rid of any other con@@ founding issues , and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right . &quot;
when the animals saw an otherwise expres@@ sion@@ less dog move its tail to the right ( from the tail@@ -@@ wag@@ ging dog &apos;s point of view ) , they stayed perfectly relaxed .
but when they spo@@ t@@ ted a tail ve@@ er pre@@ domin@@ antly to the left ( again from the tail@@ -@@ sw@@ ishing dog &apos;s point of view ) , their heart rates pic@@ ked up and they looked an@@ x@@ ious .
pr@@ of v@@ all@@ or@@ ti@@ gar@@ a said he didn &apos;t think that the dogs were inten@@ tionally communic@@ ating with each other through these movements .
instead , he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shoul@@ dn &apos;t feel wor@@ ried about .
he said : &quot; if you have several meetings with other dogs , and frequently their tail wag@@ ging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour , and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour , you respond on the basis of that experience . &quot;
the researchers say the findings could give owners , ve@@ ts and tra@@ in@@ ers a better insight into their animal &apos;s emo@@ tions .
dog behaviour expert john br@@ ad@@ sha@@ w , a visiting fellow at the university of bri@@ st@@ ol &apos;s school of veter@@ inary science , said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to can@@ ines .
last year a team from the university of l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggres@@ sive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog .
and in another research paper from the university of victori@@ a in canada , he said : &quot; dogs were more likely to approach a robo@@ t dog when its &apos; tail &apos; was made to wa@@ g left rather than right , rather than becoming an@@ x@@ ious - the opposite way around to the italian study . &quot;
he said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpre@@ ting the animals in the films or robo@@ -@@ dogs as can@@ ines .
a study of how dogs respon@@ ded to real dogs could help , he explained .
&quot; while there is considerable evidence from many different m@@ am@@ m@@ als that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes , much of the detail still has to be ham@@ me@@ red out - and dogs are no exception , &quot; he said .
however , given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way , sometimes the other .

po@@ pe franc@@ is to name first car@@ din@@ als in february
po@@ pe franc@@ is will create new car@@ din@@ als of the catho@@ lic church for his first time on february 22 , the v@@ ati@@ can announced thursday .
car@@ din@@ als are the high@@ est@@ -@@ ran@@ king cl@@ er@@ gy in the catho@@ lic church below the po@@ pe , and they &apos;re the ones who el@@ ect po@@ pes , so franc@@ is will be appoin@@ ting his first group of men who will ultimately help choose his success@@ or .
there are now 20@@ 1 car@@ din@@ als .
however , once a car@@ din@@ al reach@@ es 80 he is no longer permitted to participate in the election of a po@@ pe -- this falls to a group of 120 &quot; car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors . &quot;
in a statement announ@@ cing the news , father feder@@ ico l@@ om@@ bar@@ di , a v@@ ati@@ can spo@@ kes@@ man , said a meeting of all the existing car@@ din@@ als would be held before the cere@@ mony to elev@@ ate the new car@@ din@@ als , known as a consi@@ story .
&quot; po@@ pe franc@@ is has decided to communicate his decision to con@@ vo@@ ke february &apos;s consi@@ story in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving the participation of car@@ din@@ als from different parts of the world , &quot; l@@ om@@ bar@@ di said .
j@@ ack val@@ ero of catho@@ lic vo@@ ices said that by february , the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors was likely to have dro@@ pped .
he said usually a po@@ pe would name as many car@@ din@@ als as was needed to raise the number of car@@ din@@ al elec@@ tors back to 120 and as many car@@ din@@ als aged over 80 as he wanted .
next year &apos;s consi@@ story would be significant because it would be the first since franc@@ is was elected in march this year , val@@ ero said .
at the moment there is a sort of bi@@ as towards europe and especially towards italy .
&quot; it will be interesting to see whether the new po@@ pe will nom@@ in@@ ate car@@ din@@ als from the rest of the world to restore the balance , &quot; he said .
for@@ ty percent of roman ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics are in south america , but they have a tiny number of car@@ din@@ als .
the car@@ din@@ als will also be the first to be chosen since franc@@ is formed the council of car@@ din@@ als , a group of eight car@@ din@@ als from around the world t@@ asked with looking into ways to reform the church .
in the past the po@@ pe decided everything on his own .
&quot; now franc@@ is has selected these eight car@@ din@@ als to help him , &quot; val@@ ero said .
he said it was &quot; quite possible &quot; that franc@@ is would ask the car@@ din@@ als for advice .
but we &apos;ve not been in that situation before -- it &apos;s all completely new .
val@@ ero said po@@ pes typically elev@@ ated bis@@ ho@@ ps from large places to the position of car@@ din@@ al but that franc@@ is was &quot; full of surpris@@ es -- so we don &apos;t know who he &apos;ll name . &quot;

on some of the tr@@ uc@@ ks , the front seats may have a def@@ ect in the rec@@ lining mechanism .
as a result , the se@@ at@@ backs fail to comply with federal auto safety standards on head re@@ stra@@ ints .
&quot; if the vehicle is struck from behind , the head re@@ stra@@ int may not properly protect occup@@ ants , increasing the risk of in@@ jury , &quot; according to the notice posted on the national highway traffic safety administration website .
the rec@@ alled models were built between august 1 and september 10 .
g@@ m &apos;s tr@@ uck roll@@ -@@ out began in june and represents the most important vehicle launch for the no . 1 u.s. autom@@ ak@@ er since its 2009 bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy restructuring .

an obama vo@@ ter &apos;s cr@@ y of des@@ pair
i voted for president obama twice , sharing hope in possibility of change
he says obama has had worthy efforts th@@ war@@ ted by go@@ p ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism
ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism can &apos;t exc@@ use ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are website wo@@ es , dr@@ one attacks
obama &apos;s 2008 campaign mem@@ o@@ ir is a sad remin@@ der of what might have been
na@@ than@@ i@@ el p. mor@@ r@@ is is a secon@@ d-@@ year student at har@@ v@@ ard medical school .
i &apos;m reading a terri@@ bly sad book these days .
it &apos;s a book that i thought would up@@ lift me during the dol@@ dr@@ ums of secon@@ d-@@ year medical school , and re@@ new in me a sense of hope .
it &apos;s called &quot; the aud@@ acity to win , &quot; and it &apos;s a mem@@ o@@ ir of bar@@ ack obama &apos;s 2008 presidential campaign .
when i &apos;m finished with my patient wri@@ te-@@ ups at night and get into bed , the book returns me to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your bre@@ ath away .
the election turned out to be a lands@@ li@@ de , and news an@@ ch@@ ors pa@@ used to reflect on the historic nature of the hour .
my class@@ mates cri@@ ed with joy , and my parents saved every newspaper they could find .
a young team of vi@@ sion@@ aries was head@@ ed for the white house , and the nation was ready for change .
during obama &apos;s transition to office in 2008 , he had an 82 % approval rating .
and then i close the book .
cutting to the present is a ru@@ de awa@@ k@@ ening , like sn@@ app@@ ing out of a dream .
it &apos;s hard to remember those days of optim@@ ism -- they seem a dist@@ ant memory , a sad remin@@ der of opportunities gone by .
change indeed happened , in the years since i cast my first bal@@ lot .
it was simply nothing i could have imag@@ ined .
i credit obama with great and varied accompl@@ ish@@ ments , from the pass@@ age of the affordable care act to our military exit from iraq , the end of &quot; don &apos;t ask don &apos;t tell , &quot; to the killing of os@@ ama b@@ in la@@ den .
moreover , i believe that par@@ tis@@ an ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism has up@@ ended too many efforts to push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care , and closing the base at gu@@ ant@@ an@@ am@@ o bay , among others .
but , after the countless times in which i have found myself defending the obama administration to colleagues and pe@@ ers , i &apos;ve reached a limit to the explanations that i can provide .
i &apos;ve reached a point of political des@@ pair .
republic@@ an ob@@ struc@@ tion@@ ism cannot explain allowing the bu@@ gging of foreign leaders , nor having dr@@ ones strike inno@@ cent children over@@ seas .
it cannot explain having the national security agency collect data on the private lives of americans , nor prosecu@@ ting wh@@ ist@@ le-@@ b@@ low@@ ers who reve@@ al government wr@@ ong@@ doing .
it cannot account for ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ating an@@ war al-@@ aw@@ la@@ ki , an american citizen , without a trial , nor shir@@ king public funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns .
it cannot justify the findings of a report that says the white house &apos;s efforts to silence the media are the &quot; most aggres@@ sive ... since the ni@@ x@@ on administration . &quot;
and , most recently , it cannot exc@@ use the failure to design a simple website more than three years since the affordable care act was signed into law .
i don &apos;t know if this is what i should have expected .
if , at 18 years old , i was supposed to figure out that governance may contradic@@ t the political campaigns that prece@@ de it .
obviously , elec@@ tive office isn &apos;t a predic@@ table course , as the oppos@@ ing political party and ran@@ dom events , such as the new@@ town mass@@ ac@@ re , will shape our public con@@ vers@@ ation .
yet , of all of the examples that i have listed above , they largely seem to be of the administration &apos;s own choosing .
that is what trou@@ b@@ les me most of all .
i voted for obama again in 2012 , but not because i was ex@@ ci@@ ted by his candi@@ d@@ acy .
mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney presented a conf@@ using and un@@ refined alternative who could not seem to lock down his policies or his positions .
i felt that a second term for obama , free from the pres@@ sures of future elections , would ful@@ fill the hope that we had heard of for so long .
still , as obama &apos;s approval rating san@@ k below 45 % this week , returning to 2008 through that book has become that much har@@ der .
it makes me year@@ n for the many promises that dis@@ appeared .
this week i was reading the por@@ tion of the book descri@@ bing how obama suffered a huge loss to clin@@ ton in the pen@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ania primary .
at a post-@@ mor@@ te@@ m campaign meeting , he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to the purpose of their cause .
&quot; i want us to get our mo@@ jo back , &quot; he said .
we &apos;ve got to remember who we are . &apos; 
it &apos;s five years later , mr. president , and i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t agree with you more .
the opinions expressed in this comm@@ entary are solely those of na@@ than@@ i@@ el mor@@ r@@ is .
cli@@ ve pal@@ mer claims pm ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has conflict of interest over paren@@ tal leave scheme
bil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e mp cli@@ ve pal@@ mer says prime minister ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t has a conflict of interest over his paren@@ tal leave scheme because his dau@@ gh@@ ters might get pregn@@ ant and benefit from it .
the mining mag@@ n@@ ate , who is in a dispute about paying a $ 6 million carbon tax bill , made the claim as he tried to brus@@ h off questions about whether he had a conflict .
the pal@@ mer united party could control up to four votes in the sen@@ ate that may be crucial in deci@@ ding if the carbon and mining taxes are a@@ xed .
but mr pal@@ mer claimed it was only ministers who could have a conflict of interest and said mr ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters stood to personally benefit from policies .
&quot; he &apos;s got a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid paren@@ tal leave because if any of those dau@@ gh@@ ters get pregn@@ ant , he &apos;ll have a direct interest whether they get leave or not , &quot; mr pal@@ mer said .
two months after the election , the electoral commission officially declared mr pal@@ mer the winner of the sun@@ shine coast seat of fair@@ fax by 53 votes , after a re@@ count .
mr pal@@ mer called for over@@ hau@@ l of election coun@@ ting to speed up the process .
ton@@ y ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s dau@@ gh@@ ters fran@@ ces and brid@@ get .
should this election be decided two months after we stopped voting ?
&quot; we need to have a better system , &quot; he said .
why is it that we shoul@@ dn &apos;t have a system where you can walk in , pun@@ ch your details into a computer , vote immediately and have a result at 6.@@ 30 that night ?
mr pal@@ mer also critic@@ ised the use of p@@ enc@@ ils to mark bal@@ lots .
is it because they can ru@@ b out the result if someone doesn &apos;t like it ?
in this day and age having a pen@@ cil seems extraordinary .
the electoral commission has been stu@@ dying options for electronic voting and recently released a joint discussion paper with new ze@@ al@@ and .
mr pal@@ mer , 59 , said his policies included an international airport for the sun@@ shine coast and he would take &quot; very seriously &quot; his new job .
public office is about public service .
&quot; we seek no re@@ ward , except the re@@ ward of history that we can at a critical time serve this community , &quot; he said .
r@@ bs sus@@ pen@@ ds two fore@@ x trad@@ ers
royal bank of scotland has suspended two trad@@ ers in its foreign exchange division according to two people familiar with the situation , in another sign that the global pro@@ be by regul@@ ators into the susp@@ ected man@@ ip@@ ulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining tr@@ action .
some of the world &apos;s largest banks , including u@@ bs , bar@@ cla@@ ys , deutsche bank and r@@ bs , have confirmed they are co-@@ operating with regul@@ ators in investigations into the world &apos;s largest financial market , where $ 5.@@ 3@@ t@@ n changes hands each day .
the two trad@@ ers would be the first r@@ bs employees to be suspended in the wid@@ ening pro@@ be that ec@@ ho@@ es the lib@@ or inter@@ bank l@@ ending man@@ ip@@ ulation scand@@ al .
the bank , which dec@@ lined to comment on the sus@@ pensions , confirmed this month that it has received requests for information from regul@@ ators .
&quot; our ongoing inquiry into this matter continues and we are co-@@ operating fully with the f@@ ca and our other regul@@ ators , &quot; the bank said two weeks ago .
last month , people close to the situation said that r@@ bs had turned over records of em@@ ail@@ s and inst@@ ant messages to the uk regul@@ ator , the financial conduct authority , sent to and from a former trad@@ er .
this trad@@ er , richard us@@ her , left r@@ bs in 2010 and is understand to have be given leave from his current position as european head of fore@@ x spot trading at j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan .
ro@@ h@@ an ram@@ ch@@ and@@ ani , head of european spot trading at cit@@ i , went on leave this week , while mat@@ t gar@@ din@@ er , a former senior curren@@ cies trad@@ er at bar@@ cla@@ ys and u@@ bs , was suspended by standard char@@ tered this week .
none of these trad@@ ers have been accused of any wr@@ ong@@ doing .
mr us@@ her &apos;s inst@@ ant message group included ban@@ kers at bar@@ cla@@ ys and ci@@ ti@@ group , people close to the situation said .
u@@ bs said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after the swiss regul@@ ator , fin@@ ma , said it was investig@@ ating susp@@ ected man@@ ip@@ ulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of swiss banks .
at least six authorities glob@@ ally - the european commission , fin@@ ma , switzerland &apos;s competition authority we@@ ko , the f@@ ca , the department of justice in the us and the hong kong monetary authority - are looking at alleg@@ ations that ban@@ kers col@@ lu@@ ded to move the curren@@ cies market .
h@@ s@@ bc , ci@@ ti@@ group , j@@ p@@ mor@@ gan and credit su@@ is@@ se have also launched internal prob@@ es or received requests for information from regul@@ ators , said people familiar with the situation .
banks are s@@ cour@@ ing through years &quot; worth of inst@@ ant messages and em@@ ail@@ s to search for in@@ stances of wr@@ ong@@ doing .
news about the prob@@ es has r@@ att@@ led trad@@ ers in an area that has been one of the bigger profit drivers of investment banks &apos; trading units in past years but which has been challeng@@ ed this year as low vo@@ la@@ tility in curren@@ cies cuts opportunities for spec@@ ul@@ ators .
some ban@@ kers have tried to play down the aff@@ air by saying the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to man@@ ip@@ ulate , but senior trad@@ ers are saying this is not necessarily true .
a senior trad@@ er said that despite the huge volume of daily foreign exchange trading , the frag@@ ment@@ ation of liqui@@ dity between different trading platforms and banks &quot; increasing use of their own internal platforms meant that &quot; you can start to get an impact on the market at quite small ticket prices . &quot;
the news came on the same day as credit su@@ is@@ se announced it had dis@@ missed a trad@@ er at its london exchange tr@@ aded funds desk this week after he had caused a nearly $ 6@@ m loss late last year .
the bank promp@@ tly notified the relevant authorities and has been co-@@ operating with its regul@@ ators .
&quot; we are confident the trad@@ er acted alone and that the matter has been contained , &quot; credit su@@ is@@ se said .
ho@@ ar@@ ding on the bec@@ h@@ tle p@@ lot pain@@ ted
a group belonging to the &quot; sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese &quot; citizen &apos;s initiative has given the ho@@ ar@@ ding on the bec@@ h@@ tle p@@ lot on the spa promen@@ ade in bad her@@ ren@@ al@@ b a fac@@ e-@@ lift .
in addition , they have clean@@ ed and wi@@ den@@ ed the foot@@ path , a press release announced .
the planned covering of the dil@@ ap@@ id@@ ated house to the re@@ ar of the p@@ lot was not permitted for safety reasons , as the premises were at risk of collap@@ sing .
al@@ f@@ red ab@@ el , who currently man@@ ages the site , arranged the &apos; fac@@ e-@@ lift &apos; in cooperation with his colleague , rein@@ hard dom@@ ke , from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
before the citizen &apos;s initiative project , a ban@@ ner with the message &quot; we are in favour &quot; was put up .
however , this did little to di@@ str@@ act the 20 or so members of the citizen &apos;s initiative from their project .
their mo@@ tto , on the large b@@ ill@@ board stated &quot; we are against un@@ finished buildings &quot; .
in so doing they wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ru@@ ins on the sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese - should the huge project one day fail .
ch@@ at@@ ting with many people passing by the &quot; construction site &quot; , it became clear that many citizens believe the execution of the project would make things much better for the town , although many have the same questions as the citizen &apos;s initiative regarding the scale of the planned project .
however , they are beginning to resi@@ gn themselves as the town continues to st@@ all in providing answers , said a statement from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
we have now been told that the public statements made by the may@@ or are also having an impact .
in may , in the meeting of the town council , he said that he fe@@ ared for the outcome of the spa should the population vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on the sch@@ we@@ iz@@ er wi@@ ese in the local referendum .
some appear ut@@ ter@@ ly fri@@ ghten@@ ed by it , others per@@ cei@@ ve it as a &quot; bl@@ at@@ ant attempt to black@@ mail &quot; the population , continued the press release from the citizen &apos;s initiative .
the citizen &apos;s initiative than@@ ked those who don@@ ated paint and all those who l@@ ent a hand .
ran@@ gn@@ ick s@@ col@@ ding for ref@@ s : man@@ e is no di@@ ver
as satisfied as r@@ al@@ f ran@@ gn@@ ick is with the present winning form of the austrian bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a tab@@ le-@@ top@@ p@@ ers , red bu@@ ll salzburg , the sporting director of the &quot; bu@@ lls &quot; expressed equal dis@@ appointment with the re@@ fe@@ re@@ es .
&quot; there is currently a dangerous trend , with man@@ e and al@@ an being du@@ b@@ bed as &apos; di@@ vers &apos; , &quot; he said at a press conference in sal@@ burg on thursday , in defence of the two tr@@ ick@@ y off@@ ensive players .
the most recent cause for ran@@ gn@@ ick &apos;s criticism was the yellow card for man@@ e at 3 : 0 against gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g last sunday , whereby the sen@@ eg@@ al@@ ese stri@@ ker was pen@@ alised for supposed play acting - ad@@ mit@@ tedly this was not justified , as shown by tv foot@@ age .
&quot; a bl@@ at@@ ant wrong decision , &quot; comm@@ ented ran@@ gn@@ ick , who referred to har@@ k@@ am as being &quot; completely out of his depth &quot; .
har@@ k@@ am also played &quot; his part &quot; in the es@@ cal@@ ation between salzburg co@@ ach ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t and gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g tra@@ iner ad@@ i h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter after the game .
he firmly def@@ ended his german comp@@ at@@ ri@@ ot : &quot; in each individual situation i would have beha@@ ved in the same way as ro@@ ger sch@@ mid@@ t &quot; .
sch@@ mid@@ t himself did not wish to have any contact with his colleagues after the sk@@ ir@@ m@@ ish with h@@ ü@@ t@@ ter .
i do not know why .
&quot; after all , i was the one who was insul@@ ted , &quot; emphasised the 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old .
however , with regard to the winning run , ran@@ gn@@ ick san@@ g his team &apos;s pra@@ ises .
&quot; there are only two words for it : really good , &quot; he stated .
there is not a lot you can critic@@ ise .
most of all , the manner in which the team is playing is impressive .
we must stay composed and keep it up .
there will hardly be any squ@@ ad changes in the winter transfer window .
there is no major reason to change anything .
&quot; unless a player comes forward and expres@@ ses the desire to leave the club , &quot; explained ran@@ gn@@ ick .
supreme court up@@ holds obama health care law
in a major victory for the obama administration , the us supreme court today rul@@ ed bar@@ ack obama &apos;s signature health care law is constitutional .
by a 5-@@ 4 vote , the jus@@ tic@@ es rul@@ ed the patient protection and affordable care act &apos;s individual mandate - which requires citizens to buy health insurance by 20@@ 14 or else pay a penalty - was constitutional under the tax@@ ing power of the government .
chief justice john ro@@ ber@@ ts sid@@ ed with the four more liberal members of the court while jus@@ tic@@ es sc@@ alia , thomas , ali@@ to and ken@@ ne@@ dy dis@@ sen@@ ted .
the court also u@@ ph@@ eld the remaining sections of the 27@@ 00 page law , and further held that the health care law &apos;s requirement that states increase medic@@ aid eli@@ gi@@ bility or else lose all federal medic@@ aid funding is not un@@ constitu@@ tionally co@@ er@@ ci@@ ve .
the suit to block the law was brought by 26 states and the national federation of independent business .
the law was vigor@@ ously opposed by each of the major republic@@ an presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season , including pre@@ sump@@ tive nom@@ ine@@ e mit@@ t ro@@ m@@ ney .
norway : nor@@ we@@ gian village lights itself up with huge mir@@ r@@ ors
using huge mir@@ r@@ ors , the residents of a nor@@ we@@ gian village have brought light to their dre@@ ary valley .
due to the low level of sun@@ shine , from autumn until spring the village of r@@ ju@@ k@@ an in the ve@@ st@@ f@@ jor@@ d valley normally langu@@ ishes in the shado@@ ws of the surrounding mountains .
with three gi@@ gan@@ tic mir@@ r@@ ors , each 45 metres t@@ all , a centur@@ i@@ es-@@ old dream came true on wednesday .
&quot; finally ! &apos; , ra@@ ved may@@ or ste@@ in@@ ar ber@@ gs@@ land at the in@@ aug@@ ural cere@@ mony , tele@@ vised by broad@@ cas@@ ter t@@ v@@ 2 .
some valley residents lay back on sun loun@@ gers , while others safe@@ ly put on their sun@@ gl@@ asses .
up until now , those hun@@ gr@@ y for sun@@ shine in the winter had to travel to a nearby peak by cable car .
ten years ago , local artist martin an@@ der@@ sen presented the proposal of direc@@ ting the sun into the valley using mir@@ r@@ ors .
however , this basic idea had been talked of in the location since 19@@ 13 .
after several years of debate , the town council finally approved the project , which cost 5 million kr@@ one ( around eur 6@@ 15@@ ,000 ) .
a similar construction has provided sun@@ shine to the italian alpine resort of vi@@ gan@@ ella for a number of years .
the post is hardly ever emp@@ ti@@ ed on sun@@ days
&quot; many citizens will not yet have noticed that red do@@ ts indic@@ ating a sunday post collection are still to be found on many post boxes in the town centre and its distric@@ ts. however , if you read the small print on the yellow boxes operated by post ag , you will quickly find out that the boxes are no longer emp@@ ti@@ ed on sun@@ days and holidays , &quot; announced the f@@ dp .
an inquiry by the f@@ dp confirmed this .
only the post boxes in front of the post office building at ern@@ st-@@ lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 36 and at j@@ ak@@ ob@@ -@@ m@@ ü@@ ll@@ er-@@ stra@@ ß@@ e 1 in h@@ ü@@ t@@ ten@@ fel@@ d are still emp@@ ti@@ ed .
whether there are still sunday collections in ho@@ f@@ heim and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten is not addressed in the inquiry by the f@@ dp .
the f@@ dp spo@@ kes@@ person for social and you@@ th-@@ related affairs , fr@@ it@@ z r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k wants to di@@ g de@@ eper into this .
the sunday collection is an important postal service , especially in the case of scheduled post .
&quot; the company is rad@@ ically and un@@ accep@@ tably cutting back on this , despite the price increase for letters in january 2013 .
thomas bit@@ t@@ ner , liberal party parliamentary group and municip@@ al association chairman , is supporting his fellow group members : &quot; what an@@ no@@ ys me , is the fact that the collection times have been changed or cancelled on the quiet here &quot; .
in so doing , the postal service is miles off the mark when it comes to public acces@@ sibility .
&quot; at least the post boxes in the districts of ne@@ us@@ ch@@ lo@@ ß and ros@@ eng@@ ar@@ ten must still be emp@@ ti@@ ed on sun@@ days , &quot; said bit@@ t@@ ner and r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k in un@@ ison .
it is also the case for the town centre that those citizens in particular who are not mobile must also be able to access a post box with a sunday collection on foot .
in the town parliament , r@@ ö@@ h@@ ren@@ bec@@ k asked whether the town council was planning discussions with the postal service regarding this matter .
may@@ or er@@ ich ma@@ i@@ er respon@@ ded that the postal service had not communic@@ ated with lam@@ per@@ the@@ im .
to the best of his knowledge , however , there is a sunday collection in ho@@ f@@ heim .
their party has spoken out in favour of priva@@ tisation .
&quot; decisions will then be made elsewhere , &quot; said ma@@ i@@ er .
frankfurt parking fees to increase dram@@ atically
parking in frankfurt could soon be notic@@ e@@ ably more expensive .
the city mag@@ i@@ str@@ ate today discussed a sub@@ mission by the head of the department for transport , ste@@ fan maj@@ er ( green party ) .
according to the proposal , parking fees are to be increased by 50 per cent .
this increase will not , however , be the result of raised prices , but rather the fact that time inter@@ val permitted by parking meters and tic@@ ke@@ ting machines will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .
the city council must reach a decision on this in december .
the retail committee of the frankfurt chamber of industry and commerce believes that this is &quot; not a good idea &quot; .
the option of parking right outside their businesses is &quot; an advantage to smaller re@@ tail@@ ers that must not be un@@ de@@ res@@ ti@@ mated . &quot; .
the ver@@ ke@@ hr@@ s@@ club deutsch@@ land ( german traffic club ) is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is &quot; completely appropriate and actually long over@@ due &quot; .
local public transport will also become more expensive .
fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt : quick moves take hosts by surprise
with a s@@ len@@ der squ@@ ad , the ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt her@@ ren i team ( men &apos;s first team ) ste@@ pped into the sch@@ ill@@ er school gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um in re@@ ut@@ ling@@ en to face t@@ g g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ingen of the sw@@ ab@@ ian al@@ b region .
the al@@ b men stood on the other side of the net with what was undoubtedly a more experienced team .
however , it soon became evident that , due in part to their age , they could not really keep up with the fast pace of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt team .
g@@ ö@@ n@@ n@@ ingen found it extremely difficult to cope with the hard and well-@@ posi@@ tioned off@@ ensive moves .
they repeatedly missed the passes and attacks coming clean@@ ly over the net from sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z and their bloc@@ king game was not up to scr@@ at@@ ch .
clear vic@@ tories in the first two sets clearly demonstrated the superi@@ ority of the fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt team in all areas .
faced with this overwhel@@ ming and mat@@ ch-@@ determin@@ ing performance , the third set was won following a somewhat t@@ ame and spirit@@ less performance , for a final score of 3 : 0 ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .
on 2 november , when they play tv ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n , who managed a clear victory in n@@ ag@@ old , they will step onto the court to face a much stronger oppon@@ ent .
ts@@ v fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt i : dom@@ ini@@ k b@@ ä@@ u@@ er@@ le , y@@ anni@@ k b@@ ü@@ ch@@ le , se@@ bas@@ tian d@@ ö@@ l@@ ker , fe@@ li@@ x p@@ ä@@ l@@ chen , ste@@ fan r@@ ä@@ ller , sim@@ on sch@@ en@@ k and e@@ du@@ ard schul@@ z .
in the b class , two teams from ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n and fre@@ u@@ den@@ stadt faced off in the m@@ urg@@ tal@@ hal@@ le in ba@@ i@@ er@@ s@@ br@@ on@@ n .
they produced a har@@ d-@@ fought two-@@ hour match .
ner@@ ves on both sides , particularly when receiving the ball , resulted in errors and lost points ; there was even a lack of passing at times and at some critical moments o@@ vere@@ ag@@ er@@ ness saw potential points was@@ ted .
however , in this even@@ ly mat@@ ched game , the great physical effort of mar@@ c@@ us bl@@ as@@ ut@@ to &apos;s ts@@ v team proved decisive in spite of tremend@@ ous commitment by both teams .
maintenance day at the small &apos; eng@@ l@@ än@@ der@@ h@@ ü@@ t@@ te@@ &apos;
for what was then the fifth maintenance day in the follow-up to the natur@@ a 2000 project in upper hot@@ z@@ en@@ wal@@ d , a group of dedicated participants met at the small eng@@ l@@ än@@ der@@ h@@ ü@@ tte ( eng@@ lish@@ man &apos;s cot@@ tage ) in ib@@ ach
following suggestions from the population , the of the valley in the area of the cot@@ tage was to be cle@@ ared , said may@@ or hel@@ mu@@ t ka@@ is@@ er .
according to ka@@ is@@ er , many hi@@ kers refer to this area as the show@@ piece of the sch@@ lu@@ ch@@ ten@@ ste@@ i@@ g , where the landscape provides the ideal framework for fantastic views .
he than@@ ked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasised that the maintenance day is a suitable instrument through which to strengthen the connection between people and nature ,
he is offering every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .
at the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration .
this environmental aspect was explained by fri@@ e@@ deri@@ ke tribu@@ ka@@ it of the department of nature conservation of the fre@@ i@@ burg regional council , following the gre@@ e@@ ting by regional counc@@ ill@@ or ti@@ l@@ man bol@@ l@@ ach@@ er , who had taken on the role of pat@@ ron and w@@ ished the campaign every success .
according to tribu@@ ka@@ it , the tourist objective of the vision coinci@@ ded with the goal of preser@@ ving the now extremely over@@ grown old all@@ m@@ end gra@@ zing pa@@ st@@ ure , with its specific protected habit@@ ats , through its opening and connection to the still existing gra@@ zing land .
certain species , such as rare but@@ ter@@ f@@ lies or gr@@ as@@ sho@@ pp@@ ers , cannot get past barriers in the form of forest areas .
they require these clear pa@@ th@@ ways in order to preserve their species .
tribu@@ ka@@ it said that she did not want to fail to use this opportunity to say a word in defence of the planned bio@@ sphere area .
the current measures do not integrate se@@ am@@ lessly into these plans .
a bio@@ sphere area offers the chance for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised unesco status , and thus offers an extension to what has been achieved thus far with the life project and the previous care days .
after the various statements , forest ran@@ ger chri@@ stop@@ h we@@ h@@ le and life project manager cor@@ ne@@ lia bis@@ ch@@ off divided the help@@ ers into groups .
the larger trees had been cut down in advance , although forest trac@@ tors were on-@@ call if required .
one group of help@@ ers were to take care of the clear@@ ance of juni@@ per bus@@ hes and the maintenance of a dry stone wall .
the objective was to create a clear view at the view@@ point .
l@@ ö@@ ff@@ ingen : kö@@ p@@ fl@@ er still the only candidate
information online : although l@@ ö@@ ff@@ ingen , the small town of ba@@ ar , with its 7@@ ,@@ 5@@ 14 residents , can be described as having an int@@ act infrastructure , forwar@@ d-@@ looking school , youth and senior citizens policies and its own municip@@ al energy companies , thus far no-@@ one has registered as a second ma@@ yor@@ al candidate .
so far , the only candidate to succeed may@@ or nor@@ bert bru@@ gger , who is no longer running on account of his age , is 4@@ 6-@@ year-@@ old ban@@ ker and business econom@@ ist di@@ e@@ ter kö@@ p@@ fl@@ er from l@@ ö@@ ff@@ ingen .

google , sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i su@@ ed over nor@@ tel patents
the group that own@@ s thousands of former nor@@ tel patents fil@@ ed a bar@@ r@@ age of patent law@@ su@@ its on thursday against cell phone manufacturers including google , the company it out@@ bid in the nor@@ tel bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy au@@ ction .
ro@@ ck@@ star , the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um that bought the nor@@ tel patents for $ 4.@@ 5 billion , su@@ ed sam@@ sung electronics co ltd , ht@@ c cor@@ p , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and four other companies for patent infringement in u.s. district court in tex@@ as .
ro@@ ck@@ star is jointly owned by apple , microsoft , black@@ ber@@ ry , er@@ ic@@ s@@ son and sony .
google is accused of in@@ fr@@ inging seven patents .
the patents cover technology that helps match internet search terms with relevant advertising , the law@@ suit said , which is the core of google &apos;s search business .
representatives for sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i , ht@@ c and ro@@ ck@@ star could not immediately be reached .
sam@@ sung , hu@@ a@@ we@@ i and ht@@ c all manufacture phones that operate on google &apos;s and@@ ro@@ id operating system , which compe@@ tes fi@@ er@@ ce@@ ly with apple and microsoft mobile products .
in 2011 google placed an initial $ 9@@ 00 million bid for nor@@ tel &apos;s patents .
google increased its bid several times , ultimately offering as much as $ 4.@@ 4 billion .
after losing out to ro@@ ck@@ star on the nor@@ tel patents , google went on to acquire motor@@ ola mobility for $ 12.@@ 5 billion , a deal driven partly by motor@@ ola &apos;s library of patents .
&quot; despite losing in its attempt to acquire the pat@@ ent@@ s-@@ in-@@ suit at au@@ ction , google has infring@@ ed and continues to infring@@ e , &quot; the law@@ suit said .
ro@@ ck@@ star is seeking increased damages against google , as it claims google &apos;s patent infringement is will@@ ful , according to the compla@@ int .
egypt swe@@ ars in first freely elected president
mo@@ ham@@ ed mor@@ si takes the o@@ ath of office but his day of tri@@ um@@ ph is unlikely to mark end of political stri@@ fe in egypt .
islam@@ ist mo@@ ham@@ ed mor@@ si promised a &quot; new egypt &quot; as he took the o@@ ath of office to become the country &apos;s first freely elected president , succe@@ eding ho@@ s@@ ni mu@@ bar@@ ak who was ous@@ ted 16 months ago .
at his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation before the supreme constitutional court , mor@@ si also became the arab world &apos;s first freely elected islam@@ ist president and egypt &apos;s fifth head of state since the over@@ throw of the mon@@ arch@@ y some 60 years ago .
he took the o@@ ath before the court &apos;s 18 black@@ -@@ ro@@ bed jud@@ ges in its n@@ il@@ e-@@ side seat built to res@@ em@@ ble an ancient egyp@@ tian temple .
&quot; we asp@@ ire to a better tomorrow , a new egypt and a second republic , &quot; mor@@ si said during a sole@@ m@@ n cere@@ mony shown live on state television .
&quot; today , the egyp@@ tian people laid the foundation of a new life - absolute freedom , a genuine democracy and stability , &quot; said mor@@ si , a 6@@ 0-@@ year-@@ old us@@ -@@ trained engine@@ er from the muslim bro@@ ther@@ hood , a fundament@@ alist group that has spent most of the 8@@ 4 years since its inc@@ ep@@ tion as an out@@ la@@ wed organisation har@@ sh@@ ly targeted by succ@@ essive governments .
hundreds of soldiers and polic@@ em@@ en guar@@ ded the building as mor@@ si arrived shortly after 11@@ am local time in a small motor@@ c@@ ade .
only several hundred sup@@ porters gathered outside the court to che@@ er the new president and , in a departure from the presidential pom@@ p of the mu@@ bar@@ ak years , traffic was only briefly hal@@ ted to allow his motor@@ c@@ ade through on the usually busy road lin@@ king the city centre with its southern sub@@ ur@@ bs .
deri@@ ded as the bro@@ ther@@ hood &apos;s un@@ char@@ is@@ matic &quot; spare ty@@ re , &quot; his personal presti@@ ge has sur@@ ged since his victory and his delivery of a friday speech that tried to present him as a candidate not just of islam@@ ists but of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 u@@ pris@@ ing against the author@@ itarian mu@@ bar@@ ak .
&quot; egypt today is a civil , national , constitutional and modern state , &quot; mor@@ si , we@@ aring a blue business suit and a red ti@@ e , told the jud@@ ges in the woo@@ d-@@ pan@@ elled chamber where he took the o@@ ath of office .
mor@@ si later travell@@ ed to ca@@ iro university where he was to make his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation address .
he was given an official welcome by an army band that played the national an@@ them as he stood to attention .
military rul@@ er field mar@@ sh@@ al hus@@ sein tan@@ ta@@ w@@ i was in att@@ end@@ ance .
his arrival was gre@@ e@@ ted with chan@@ ts of , &quot; the army and the people are one hand , &quot; from the hundreds gathered in the university &apos;s main lec@@ ture room .
established in 19@@ 08 as a bas@@ tion of sec@@ ular education , ca@@ iro university later became a strong@@ hold of islam@@ ist student groups in the 197@@ 0s .
mor@@ si took a symbo@@ lic o@@ ath on friday in ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r square , birth@@ place of the u@@ pris@@ ing that ended mu@@ bar@@ ak &apos;s author@@ itarian rule last year , and vo@@ wed to rec@@ la@@ im presidential powers stri@@ pped from his office by the military council that took over from the ous@@ ted leader .
but by agre@@ eing to take the official o@@ ath before the court , rather than before parliament as is custom@@ ary , he is bo@@ wing to the military &apos;s will in an indication that the contest for power will continue .
mor@@ si &apos;s speech in ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r square was filled with dramatic popul@@ ist ge@@ st@@ ures .

work@@ er falls from lad@@ der : seriously in@@ ju@@ red
on thursday , a 5@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old work@@ er in e@@ gg@@ el@@ s@@ berg fell from a lad@@ der while replac@@ ing a broken external sensor and was seriously in@@ ju@@ red .
the man from lam@@ pre@@ ch@@ t@@ sha@@ us@@ en wanted to replace a broken heating sensor on the external fac@@ ade of a guest house .
as he was climbing the lad@@ der , which was re@@ sting on the roof gu@@ t@@ tering , it sli@@ pped away and the man fell onto the concrete below .
he suffered serious in@@ jur@@ ies and was taken by the &quot; chri@@ stop@@ hor@@ us 6 &quot; rescue helicop@@ ter to the salzburg regional hospital .
rap@@ ist in south africa : two life sent@@ ences
nine months after the brut@@ al ra@@ pe and mu@@ ti@@ lation of a 17@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl in south africa , the perpe@@ tr@@ ator was condemned to two life sent@@ ences on friday .
this was reported by broad@@ cas@@ ter sab@@ c .
the victim later died as a result of the serious in@@ jur@@ ies .
joh@@ ann@@ es k@@ ana had already been found guil@@ ty of the crime at the start of the week .
the crime had caused nation@@ wide hor@@ ror .
the then 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old had rap@@ ed an@@ ene boo@@ y@@ sen in february in an industrial estate in bre@@ d@@ as@@ dor@@ p , near ca@@ pe@@ town .
for 14 hours , doctors batt@@ led to save the life of the victim , ultimately in v@@ ain .
the sight of the young girl was so hor@@ ri@@ fic that the care@@ rs and nur@@ sing staff required psycho@@ logical support .
during the trial , k@@ ana ad@@ mitted to having been in a bar with boo@@ y@@ sen on the night of the attack .
he also ad@@ mitted to be@@ ating and rap@@ ing her , however he denied being responsible for the death of the girl .
the police had initially assumed that there were multiple att@@ ack@@ ers , however , they released two susp@@ ects from cust@@ o@@ dy as the evidence against them was insufficient .
during the proceedings the public prosecu@@ tion also emphasised that they were convinced that k@@ ana was alone at the time of the attack .
rap@@ es are almost part of everyday life in south africa : there are around 6@@ 4@@ ,000 reports of sexual as@@ sa@@ ult every year .
this is almost ten times as many as in germany , although with a population of 82 million people , germany has a much higher number of residents than south africa ( 50 million ) .
police and women &apos;s associations in south africa , however , es@@ timate the number of un@@ reported cases of sexual as@@ sa@@ ult to be 10-@@ 25 times as high .
jum@@ bo visits the home of black forest ham
jum@@ bo on the search for the &quot; world &apos;s best ham &quot; : for the tv programme &quot; galile@@ o &quot; , the pro@@ 7 star visited bon@@ n@@ dorf .
the pres@@ enter established one thing right from the outset : the most important thing when it comes to ham are the leg@@ s of por@@ k - tur@@ bo f@@ atten@@ ing does not provide a good basis for this .
can ham bought in a super@@ market be as good as a quality product ?
ul@@ i , bo@@ ss of the large ham factory in sch@@ war@@ z@@ wal@@ d , explained to jum@@ bo how the bon@@ n@@ dorf company , &quot; ad@@ ler &quot; , operates .
&quot; germany &apos;s mo@@ st-@@ loved ham , &quot; said jum@@ bo , presenting the black forest ham .
he could only enter the factory when we@@ aring hair protection and a white co@@ at .
jum@@ bo also had to first dis@@ inf@@ ect his hands before he could reach for the micro@@ phone .
jum@@ bo seen getting something to keep him going at a fast food restaurant in wal@@ d@@ sh@@ ut
&quot; here they work with huge quantities , &quot; comm@@ ented the television producers , ast@@ on@@ ished by the mass production of black forest ham .
16@@ ,000 jo@@ ints of meat per week speak for themselves .
weight , f@@ at content and colour : ul@@ i explained what was required for the best quality .
the majority of the pi@@ gs are slau@@ gh@@ tered at six months old .
television with standards ?
even specific details such as the ph value of the meat play a role .
the dar@@ ker the meat , the higher the ph value .
&quot; i would be cur@@ ious what would happen if you were to measure ro@@ ber@@ to blan@@ co , &quot; said jum@@ bo cy@@ n@@ ically .
here the standard of private television production is presented in its pu@@ rest form .
nonetheless , it is worth watching .
the vie@@ wer sees that jo@@ ints are still car@@ ved by hand .
after all : black forest ham tradi@@ tionally arri@@ ves on the shel@@ f bon@@ eless .
the secret of the ham is the mix of her@@ bs combined with salt .
the appearance of the smoking tower and furn@@ ace remind jum@@ bo of a sub@@ marine .
the tr@@ ick : here f@@ ir branches in the smo@@ ker provide the special flav@@ our of black forest ham .
after 20 days in the smo@@ ke , the ham is finally almost black .
&quot; and now the s@@ lic@@ e will dis@@ appear inside jum@@ bo , &quot; he said , announ@@ cing his sam@@ pling of the product .
&quot; that is really delicious , &quot; said the tv star in conclusion .
all those involved will be happy with that evaluation .
thought travel agents were a thing of the past thanks to the internet ?
flight centre seem to be bu@@ cking the trend .
the company has upgrad@@ ed its full year profit forec@@ ast and is looking to record ear@@ nings from holi@@ day@@ makers in australia and the united kingdom .
the travel company now exp@@ ects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $ 3@@ 25 million and $ 3@@ 40 million , compared with the $ 30@@ 5 million to $ 3@@ 15 million it previously forec@@ ast .
if the current guidance is achieved it will represent a 12 to 17 per cent growth on the record $ 2@@ 9@@ 0.@@ 4 million profit it achieved in 2011 / 12 .
managing director gra@@ ham tur@@ ner said flight centre had made 8 per cent profit in the first half and had started the second half strongly especially in austr@@ ali@@ an and uk non-@@ business travel .
&quot; year@@ -to-@@ date , our 10 countries are prof@@ itable and several are on track for record full-@@ year ear@@ nings before interest and tax contributions , &quot; he said .
this includes australia and the united kingdom , which are typically our largest profit gener@@ ators .
in australia the leisure business re@@ boun@@ ded during the second half which off@@ set a slightly weak@@ er domestic corporate travel market .
similarly in the uk , flight centre &apos;s leisure business performed well while corporate clients were spending less .
its us business had reco@@ vered its losses during its seas@@ on@@ ally weak@@ er first half and was expected to deliver its third con@@ secu@@ tive full year profit .
flight centre shares were up 3@@ c at $ 3@@ 8.@@ 20 yesterday .
schools ur@@ ged to focus more on ma@@ ths , sp@@ elling and gram@@ mar
english literature courses will require pu@@ pil@@ s to study at least one sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are play , a 19th century novel , romantic po@@ e@@ try and contemporary british fic@@ tion from 19@@ 14 on@@ wards .
the ex@@ am will also feature &quot; un@@ seen texts &quot; to encourage wider reading ;
a combined english literature and language course will be sc@@ ra@@ pped .
from 20@@ 15 , pu@@ pil@@ s will be required to take a stand@@ alone g@@ c@@ se in language , with strong incentives to choose english literature as a separate quali@@ fication .
the department for education is due to release the new sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ uses in english and ma@@ ths tomorrow - the first subjects to under@@ go a radical over@@ hau@@ l .
it will make changes in other core subjects next year .
in a separate move , of@@ qu@@ al , the exam@@ s regul@@ ator , will un@@ ve@@ il a sha@@ ke@@ -up of the structure of g@@ c@@ ses , with a new gr@@ ading system and less cour@@ se@@ work .
speaking in the summer , michael go@@ ve , the education secretary , said there was a &quot; widespread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence , &quot; insi@@ sting g@@ c@@ ses would be &quot; more challenging , more ambitious and more rigor@@ ous . &quot;
studies show that english schools de@@ vote less time to ma@@ ths - 1@@ 16 hours a year or three hours a week during term time - than in most countries .
by comparison , austr@@ ali@@ an schools provide an average of 14@@ 3 hours a year and pu@@ pil@@ s do around 13@@ 8 hours in sing@@ apor@@ e .
while there will be no formal requirement to de@@ vote more of the timetable to ma@@ ths , coalition sources said the extensive ma@@ ths g@@ c@@ se - combined with more weigh@@ ting for the subject in league tables - was likely to encourage schools to provide extra teaching .
the sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us will place a greater focus on &quot; real world problems , &quot; including financial mathem@@ a@@ tics .

sal@@ em : joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner at the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical discussion forum
at the next ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical discussion forum on monday 21 october , in the ne@@ ues museum des sch@@ losses ( new castle museum ) , the focus will be on the topic of &quot; to hel@@ l with hel@@ l - the@@ ological refl@@ ec@@ tions on how we now approach the notion of end times &quot; .
the speaker will be joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner .
the ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical discussion forum is an initiative of the catho@@ lic and prote@@ stant churches in sal@@ em , the sal@@ em castle and the lake con@@ stance district cultural office .
at the forum , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner wants to address the question of how people today view the &quot; end times &quot; after death .
while people in past centuries were over@@ ly conscious of it , focusing on the pictures of heav@@ en and hel@@ l &quot; that up until now have defined our ideas &quot; , contemporary pro@@ p@@ he@@ tic teaching on the hope of consum@@ mation is characterised more by a certain bas@@ h@@ ful@@ ness , or even speec@@ h@@ less@@ ness .
&quot; the greater hope has been well and truly cast out of christi@@ ans by religious cri@@ tics , &quot; said the speaker .
they have &quot; provided us with so many question marks , that we seem to have lost our ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation marks &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner continued : &quot; however , the crucial challenge to this remains fear of death &quot; .
associated with this is the matter of that long@@ ing , &quot; that dreams that everything will be good at the end &quot; .
joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner , born in 196@@ 2 in bad@@ en-@@ ba@@ den , studied catho@@ lic the@@ ology and bio@@ logy from 198@@ 2 to 1989 at the al@@ bert lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g &apos;s university in fre@@ i@@ burg .
in 1997 she gradu@@ ated as a doctor of the@@ ology , also in fre@@ i@@ burg .
a post-@@ doc@@ toral lec@@ turing quali@@ fication in fundamental the@@ ology and ec@@ um@@ en@@ ical the@@ ology followed in 2003 at the west@@ f@@ ali@@ an wil@@ hel@@ m &apos;s university .
since 2010 , joh@@ anna ra@@ h@@ ner has occupied a chair for systematic the@@ ology in the institute for catho@@ lic the@@ ology at the university of kas@@ sel .
ge@@ is@@ ling@@ en : more than 100 young ca@@ th@@ ol@@ ics from kle@@ iner heu@@ berg stand together in the confirmation of their profes@@ sion of faith
in two services , 10@@ 1 15 and 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds from the am kle@@ in@@ en heu@@ berg pa@@ stor@@ al care unit were confirmed .
in the morning , the service was accompanied by the lau@@ dat@@ o-@@ si group , while the afternoon service featured &apos; the spirit &apos; youth cho@@ ir .
upon receiving the confirmation sac@@ ram@@ ent , the young people accepted their b@@ ap@@ tism and asked for the power of the holy spirit .
over recent months those being confirmed , under the direction of de@@ ac@@ on rein@@ er de@@ h@@ ner and the assistance of several church members , have been preparing for the special day .
in various projects , they learned of the different tasks involved in christian church life and attended the youth day in un@@ ter@@ mach@@ tal together .
ill@@ men@@ see : second mountain bike race en@@ th@@ uses participants
in fantastic weather , 2@@ 14 cy@@ cli@@ sts came to ill@@ men@@ see to take on the circuit , over the hills and around the lake .
this was announced by ul@@ rich kno@@ bel of the organis@@ ing ill@@ men@@ see sports club .
among the participants there were also numerous am@@ ate@@ ur cy@@ cli@@ sts who wanted the chance to practice their ho@@ b@@ by in a competitive environment , in particular over the short distance of 15 kilometres with a 300 metr@@ e clim@@ b .
two top-@@ class junior cy@@ cli@@ sts were also in the starting lin@@ e-@@ up for the competition : fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er from bad wal@@ d@@ see and pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel from a@@ ach@@ -@@ lin@@ z came with the recommendation of having achieved good positions at the german champion@@ ships .
the pair managed to break away from the field in keeping with expectations .
as was the case the previous year , fe@@ li@@ x bad@@ er managed to hold on to a small lead right to the end and def@@ ended his title as the overall winner of the short distance race
once again , pas@@ cal tre@@ u@@ bel took second place .
in the ladies &apos; race it was the@@ res@@ a du@@ ell@@ i of team al@@ b@@ tr@@ au@@ m who managed to take top place on the po@@ dium .
in second and third places were anne a@@ del from ill@@ men@@ see and le@@ oni@@ e tre@@ i@@ ber from ow@@ ingen .
the increasing number of ri@@ ders that live or work in the area is a fantastic development .
and it was not only about top performance - the entire range of athle@@ tic ability was represented .
participants &apos; ages were also wide@@ -@@ ranging , with the youn@@ g@@ est star@@ ters at ten years old up to the oldest at over 70 .
this year , there were even more absolute top athle@@ tes at the starting line for the main race .
four cy@@ cli@@ sts managed to break away from the top regional rac@@ ers .
these included phili@@ p@@ p pan@@ ger@@ l , a semi-@@ professional mountain bi@@ ker from the black tus@@ k racing team .
together with a team m@@ ate , pan@@ ger@@ l has already twice been crow@@ ned world champi@@ on in the 12@@ -@@ hour race .
this year he became european champi@@ on in this special discipline .
also compe@@ ting was ro@@ land b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt , who has already claimed two german du@@ ath@@ l@@ on champion@@ ships .
after 45 kilometres and a clim@@ b of 9@@ 00 metres , the leading ri@@ ders were nec@@ k and nec@@ k on the final straight in front of the dre@@ i-@@ se@@ en-@@ hall .
pan@@ ger@@ l sp@@ ed over the finish line in first place .
only one second later , the experienced b@@ aller@@ ste@@ dt managed to take second place in the overall stand@@ ings .
her@@ mann and war@@ th@@ mann then reached the finish line simultaneously to take joint third in the overall stand@@ ings .
in the ladies &apos; race , christi@@ ane co@@ h@@ s@@ mann achieved the fas@@ test time in the main race .
are@@ ane bl@@ er@@ sch from bin@@ z@@ w@@ ang@@ en took second place , ahead of nat@@ as@@ ch@@ a wer@@ ner from stutt@@ gart .

dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le is one of the top 10 c@@ n@@ n her@@ oes of 2013 .
you can vote for him , or any of the other top 10 her@@ oes , to be c@@ n@@ n her@@ o of the year .
that person will receive $ 2@@ 50@@ ,000 to continue their extraordinary work .
for 21 years , geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le wat@@ ched his ill father sli@@ p in and out of consci@@ ousness , trav@@ eling to hospit@@ als that we@@ ren &apos;t equipped to help him .
j@@ ame@@ f b@@ wel@@ le was in@@ ju@@ red in a 198@@ 1 car accident near y@@ a@@ oun@@ de , camer@@ o@@ on &apos;s capital .
he suffered only a broken arm at first , but an inf@@ ection developed and spread to his brain , creating a hem@@ atom@@ a that would affect him for the rest of his life .
&quot; there were no neu@@ ro@@ sur@@ ge@@ ons in camer@@ o@@ on , &quot; geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le said .
we would have taken him out of camer@@ o@@ on if we had the money .
instead , b@@ wel@@ le spent years es@@ cor@@ ting his father to over@@ crow@@ ded clin@@ ics and hospit@@ als , getting whatever treatment they could get .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy , &quot; b@@ wel@@ le said .
you can leave home at 5 a.m. , running to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .
there are a lot of patients .
some people can die because they are waiting .
the situation has@@ n &apos;t changed much since b@@ wel@@ le &apos;s father passed away in 2002 .
in camer@@ o@@ on , there is only one doctor for every 5@@ ,000 people , according to the world health organization .
for comparison &apos;s sake , the ratio in the united states is one doctor for every 4@@ 13 people .
and even if they could see a physi@@ ci@@ an , many camer@@ o@@ oni@@ ans cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t afford it .
two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three-@@ quarters of the country &apos;s heal@@ th-@@ care spending is private .
&quot; the only problem they have is poverty , &quot; b@@ wel@@ le said .
and with poverty , they cannot enjoy their life .
seeing his father and so many of his country@@ men suffer , b@@ wel@@ le was determined to do something about it .
dr. geor@@ ges b@@ wel@@ le and his team of volunte@@ ers have performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year .
he became a doctor himself , working as a v@@ as@@ cu@@ lar sur@@ ge@@ on in y@@ a@@ oun@@ de &apos;s central hospital .
and he started a non@@ profit , as@@ co@@ vi@@ me , that trav@@ els into rural areas on week@@ ends to provide free medical care .
since 2008 , he and his group of volunte@@ ers have helped nearly 3@@ 2@@ ,000 people .
almost every friday , he and up to 30 people j@@ am into v@@ ans , ti@@ e medical supplies to the roof@@ s and travel across r@@ ough ter@@ rain to visit villages in need .
their lu@@ ck doesn &apos;t always hold out .
they &apos;ve had to push vehicles through rivers and mu@@ d more than once .
but when they arrive , they receive a true her@@ oes &apos; welcome : a fe@@ ast , sing@@ ing and d@@ ancing , and the best accommo@@ dations the community can offer .
in these villages , free medical care is truly a cause for celebr@@ ation , and b@@ wel@@ le -- with his big sm@@ ile and boun@@ dless energy -- is more than happy to join in the fun .
the next morning , the team begins meeting with hundreds of patients .
&quot; we are receiving 500 people in each trip , &quot; b@@ wel@@ le said .
they are coming from 60 kilometers around the village , and they &apos;re coming on foot .
each of these weekend clin@@ ics provides a variety of medical care .
many people are treated for mal@@ aria , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , mal@@ nutri@@ tion , di@@ abe@@ tes , par@@ a@@ sites and sex@@ ually transmitted diseases .
others might receive cr@@ ut@@ ches , a pair of don@@ ated e@@ ye@@ gl@@ asses or free birth certific@@ ates -- documentation that &apos;s required for school but that many im@@ pover@@ ished families simply can &apos;t afford .
in the even@@ ings , the team will do simple sur@@ ger@@ ies with local an@@ es@@ the@@ sia .
operations are usually done in a scho@@ ol@@ house , town hall or home ; after the procedure , patients get up and walk to the recovery area to make way for the next person .
with the group &apos;s gener@@ ator lighting the operating room and s@@ ani@@ tiz@@ ing equipment , b@@ wel@@ le and his volunte@@ ers work into the early hours of sunday morning .
it &apos;s a back@@ breaking pace , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .
&quot; they are be@@ ating dr@@ ums all night to keep us awa@@ ke and continue our work , &quot; b@@ wel@@ le said .
on sunday , the team heads back to the city , ti@@ red but proud of their work .
the group -- a mix of camer@@ o@@ on@@ ian doctors and foreign medical students -- has performed 700 free sur@@ ger@@ ies in the past year , and they know that their help can make a world of difference to those they help .
one man explained that the free her@@ nia sur@@ gery he &apos;d received will allow him to work again .
&quot; this will change my future with my family , &quot; the man said .
in addition to holding these weekend clin@@ ics and working as a hospital sur@@ ge@@ on , b@@ wel@@ le also works nights at private medical clin@@ ics around y@@ a@@ oun@@ de .
it &apos;s this second job , he said , that funds about 60 % of his non@@ profit ; the rest is covered by private don@@ ations .
&quot; i &apos;m not sure when he sle@@ eps , &quot; said k@@ ati@@ e o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , a secon@@ d-@@ year medical student from dre@@ x@@ el university in phil@@ ade@@ l@@ phi@@ a and volunte@@ er with b@@ wel@@ le &apos;s group .
he is always either at the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns .
for medical and nur@@ sing students such as o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley , who come from the united states and europe to join b@@ wel@@ le on his missions , it &apos;s a hand@@ s-@@ on opportunity they &apos;d never get at home .
&quot; we &apos;ve been able to s@@ cru@@ b in on sur@@ ger@@ ies where we help b@@ lot blood away or hold tools for dr. b@@ wel@@ le , &quot; o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said .
that &apos;s not something you &apos;d ever get to do in america as a secon@@ d-@@ year medical student .
the student volunte@@ ers usually pay their own way to camer@@ o@@ on , often arriving with don@@ ated medical supplies .
but once they arrive in y@@ a@@ oun@@ de , their board , transportation and instruc@@ tion are covered by b@@ wel@@ le .
&quot; he &apos;s a her@@ o , without a doubt , &quot; o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley said .
he gives his life to this organization , and his desire to help the camer@@ o@@ on people is ever@@ lasting .
for b@@ wel@@ le , the near@@ -@@ constant work@@ load isn &apos;t a hard@@ ship .
helping others live happ@@ i@@ er lives , ful@@ filling a promise he made to his father , is something that brings him great joy .
&quot; i am so happy when i am doing this work , &quot; b@@ wel@@ le said .
and i think about my father .
i hope he sees what i am doing .
to make people lau@@ gh , to reduce the pain , that &apos;s why i &apos;m doing this .

master@@ ing the struggle to perf@@ ection .
the role of s@@ anti@@ ago , the old man in hem@@ ing@@ way &apos;s novel &quot; the old man and the sea &quot; , is perfectly suited to hor@@ st jan@@ son .
jan@@ son is an old hand himself when it comes to his profes@@ sion , the art of acting .
the old man , s@@ anti@@ ago , is the best there is when it comes to fishing .
as such , the pair comple@@ ment one another super@@ bly .
you almost think that you can see the fol@@ ds in the old man &apos;s nec@@ k , of which young fisher@@ man man@@ olo spe@@ aks .
when s@@ anti@@ ago s@@ its ar@@ ched over on the chair , ti@@ red of life , this is a genuine emo@@ tion for jan@@ son .
furthermore , the role of the old fisher@@ man is a character role , through and through , which jan@@ son masters excell@@ ently .
hem@@ ing@@ way told the story of a figh@@ ter , a cour@@ ageous man who doesn &apos;t give up and who ultimately win@@ s the battle against the fish as a result of his knowledge and his strong will .
for long periods , jan@@ son is the only per@@ former on the stage .
he man@@ ages to focus the audience &apos;s attention on himself , with the result that his mono@@ lo@@ gues never become bor@@ ing , not even for just a moment .
his efforts to finally pul@@ l the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that members of the audience forget that the sea in question consists merely of water bott@@ les , illu@@ min@@ ated in blue .
director j@@ ens has@@ sel@@ mann has the old man in the boat perform in front of fis@@ cher@@ dorf .

tourism : des@@ cent to the roman@@ s
bene@@ ath cologne , a se@@ wage channel from roman times , measuring around 120 metres in length , has been preserved .
anyone visiting cologne cannot miss the cathedral .
the two to@@ wers , measuring around 15@@ 7 metres , extend into the heav@@ ens , making it europe &apos;s second t@@ all@@ est church building .
however , only a few visitors who mar@@ vel at the two or@@ n@@ ate church to@@ wers realise that there is much to discover bene@@ ath the cathedral .
ra@@ iner schul@@ ze is an expert when it comes to the cologne under@@ world .
the meeting point for his tours is the cologne tourism service centre , right at the cathedral .
the tour begins in a somewhat un@@ spectacular fashion : &quot; we begin in the underground car park , &quot; says schul@@ ze .
in the 197@@ 0s , the city fa@@ thers wanted a car@@ -@@ friendly city , and therefore the only sections of the old city wall that remain are those that were not too t@@ all .
the majority of the users of the parking garage therefore now hur@@ ry past the roman re@@ lic@@ s and simply drop off their car .
however , anyone who takes a closer look on parking level d@@ 2 will discover an archae@@ ological site , cor@@ don@@ ed off by metal rail@@ ings .
ru@@ ins measuring five metres t@@ all , made from stones around the size of the pal@@ m of your hand , are waiting to be discovered .
&quot; these are rem@@ n@@ ants of the roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century a.@@ d , &quot; explains schul@@ ze .
before returning to day@@ light , schul@@ ze has participants take a gl@@ ance into a dark , 15@@ -@@ metr@@ e sha@@ ft on the upper parking level .
this is the well of the old cathedral , which is bare@@ ly noticed at all these days .
the next stop on the tour is the pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um , where participants once again des@@ cen@@ d to the dep@@ ths .
here we find the residence of what was once the most powerful man to the north of the alps , the pra@@ et@@ or of the c@@ ca@@ a .
one visitor wants to know what c@@ ca@@ a means .
&quot; the ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ation stands for &quot; col@@ onia cla@@ u@@ dia ara ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ in@@ en@@ si@@ um &quot; , which is basically amounts to &quot; city under roman law and city of the ag@@ ri@@ pp@@ ini@@ ans , founded under emper@@ or cla@@ u@@ di@@ us at the site of the al@@ t@@ ars for the imperi@@ al cul@@ t &quot; .
and the pra@@ et@@ ori@@ um refers to the former govern@@ or &apos;s palace and the centre of power of the roman empire on the rh@@ ine .
from the exhibition v@@ esti@@ bu@@ le , a tunnel leads to the preserved roman se@@ wer , measuring around 120 metres in length .
&quot; if you want you can take a peaceful stroll along a section of the so-called clo@@ ac@@ a maxim@@ a , &quot; says schul@@ ze , encouraging the guests .
schul@@ ze has one more surprise .
once he has collected the key from the information desk , he leads the group to a 16@@ -@@ metr@@ e , accessible sha@@ ft .
&quot; we are now in the mi@@ k@@ we , a rit@@ ual jewish bath , &quot; he explains .
the jewish con@@ gre@@ gation built their bath deep into the ground in order to reach the gr@@ ound@@ water essential for rit@@ ual washing .
to this day the diff@@ ering water levels caused by the var@@ ying levels of the rh@@ ine can be read at the lower end of the mi@@ k@@ we , the origin@@ s of which tr@@ ace back to the eigh@@ th century .
the mi@@ k@@ we is to form part of an archae@@ ological area at the town hall square , on which construction work is set to begin shortly .
however , it will be a few years before it is complete .
le@@ g almost h@@ acked off : ro@@ ck@@ er re@@ trial
a bloo@@ dy attack within the &apos; ro@@ ck@@ er &apos; scene is to be re-@@ investig@@ ated after more than four years .
proceedings for attemp@@ ted murder , gri@@ ev@@ ous bo@@ d@@ ily harm and material damage , brought against two 30@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds have begun before the frankfurt district court .
they are being accompanied by strict security precau@@ tions .
the accused initially remained silent .
they are said to have been active within the ro@@ ck@@ er scene and to have at the time belong@@ ed to the ban@@ di@@ dos .
the public prosecu@@ tor accused them of having stab@@ bed and be@@ aten three men in a car in fin@@ ow@@ furt , together with unknown accompl@@ ices .
all the victims were seriously in@@ ju@@ red , with one man almost losing a le@@ g .
the victims were said to have belong@@ ed to the compe@@ ting gan@@ g , the hel@@ l &apos;s ang@@ els .
one is said to have been a high-@@ ran@@ king member from berlin .
it seems that the attack was prece@@ ded by a car ch@@ ase involving several cars .
according to acc@@ us@@ ations , this was part of a tur@@ f war and represented a demonstration of power .
the two accused were acqu@@ it@@ ted in an initial trial at the beginning of 2012 .
at the time , a speaker for the court said that it could not be proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloo@@ dy f@@ eu@@ d .
the as@@ sa@@ il@@ ants had wor@@ n mas@@ ks and had not been recognised .
the federal supreme court repe@@ aled the ver@@ dic@@ t following an appeal by the public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office and referred the case back to the district court for a re-@@ trial .
one of the accused is currently serving time in an open prison on account of another off@@ ence .
proceedings initially mainly involved the reconstruction of the series of events on the night of the crime .
the police inspec@@ tor responsible at the time was invited as a witness .
the central point of focus was on mobile phone conver@@ sa@@ tions between the accused and third parties , which the police had inter@@ cep@@ ted .
what makes things difficult is that ro@@ ck@@ ers almost always observe what they consider to be complete silence appe@@ aring before the court - they say absolutely nothing .
this also applies in the case of the victims .
in the first trial , only one of the victims spoke out .
when asked , public prosecu@@ tor ste@@ fan gol@@ fi@@ er of the frankfurt ( oder ) public prosecu@@ tor &apos;s office said that new evidence had come to light since the previous trial .
a further ele@@ ven days of proceedings have been scheduled for the trial .
the thro@@ wa@@ way society does not think
the night was long , the music l@@ oud and the atmosphere good , but at some point everyone has to go home .
except : in the st@@ om@@ ach@@ s of those in the passenger and back seats , hun@@ ger stri@@ kes .
of course , this may be down to the od@@ d cock@@ tail or glass of bu@@ bb@@ ly !
so what could be more natural than to cas@@ ually pul@@ l into the next dri@@ ve-@@ through to pick yourself up a little treat ?
i admit , i am right with you with it comes to pic@@ king up some fast food late at night , or early in the morning as the case may be .
a few chi@@ ps , a co@@ ke , a bur@@ ger - and then straight home and into bed !
however , on the way home the clear differences between me and other hun@@ gr@@ y clu@@ b@@ bers become evident .
what is wrong with people who continually throw their fast food bags out of the car window ? !
at the weekend in particular , dis@@ car@@ ded paper bags can be found at the side of the road and in car parks .
&quot; why is this ? &quot; i ask myself .
are the people too st@@ up@@ id to take their bags home or throw them into the ne@@ arest rub@@ b@@ ish b@@ in ?
after all , waste paper does more than spo@@ il the landscape .
bags have also been seen covering transport facilities such as cr@@ ash barriers , thus causing accidents .
however , the so-called &quot; thro@@ wa@@ way society &quot; does not think about such th@@ ing@@ s. they probably do not even know what the term even means .
if you are often out and about in the evening , more often than not with several people in the car , you will know what a back seat can look like after having parti@@ ed through the night : clothes , bott@@ les and other rub@@ b@@ ish begin to p@@ ile up .
a few bags won &apos;t make much of a difference there - in contrast to on the street where no-@@ one wants to tr@@ ample through other peoples &apos; lef@@ to@@ ver food .
i can see the day coming when towns and municip@@ alities will get fed up cle@@ aring up - and the fast food cha@@ ins will have to operate a deposit scheme for their bags .
obama &apos;s health care walk back
am@@ id a fire@@ stor@@ m of criticism , president obama yesterday wal@@ ked back his of@@ t-@@ repeated , un@@ ambigu@@ ous promise that &quot; if you like your health plan , you can keep it . &quot;
with hundreds of thousands receiving cancellation notic@@ es from their providers , republic@@ ans have s@@ lam@@ med the president in recent days for mis@@ leading the american public .
yesterday , obama t@@ weak@@ ed his original ple@@ dge .
&quot; for the vast majority of people who have health insurance that works , you can keep it , &quot; he said in a speech in bo@@ ston .
addressing what he called the &quot; fl@@ ur@@ ry in the news &quot; about the can@@ cel@@ lations , obama ur@@ ged americans receiving these notic@@ es to shop for new coverage in the marke@@ t@@ place .
most people are going to be able to get better , comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projec@@ ted .
&quot; you &apos;re going to get a better deal , &quot; he said .
the administration has said it should come as no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who purchase insurance on their own may be forced to switch plans because their coverage doesn &apos;t meet the new standards required under the affordable care act .
&quot; let me say directly to these americans : you deserve better , &quot; se@@ beli@@ us said in testi@@ mony before the house energy and commerce committee in washington .
se@@ beli@@ us , who is over@@ seeing implementation of the affordable care act , said the launch of the online marke@@ t@@ place has gone &quot; mis@@ er@@ ably &quot; since october .
&quot; i am as fru@@ stra@@ ted and an@@ gr@@ y as anyone , &quot; she said .
i am e@@ ager to earn your confidence back .
an ex@@ as@@ per@@ ated se@@ beli@@ us ut@@ tered that phrase , caught by a hot mic , to an ai@@ de se@@ ated behind her at yesterday &apos;s house hearing following a cont@@ enti@@ ous exchange with rep@@ . bil@@ ly long , r-@@ mo . , over whether she should be required to en@@ roll in ob@@ am@@ ac@@ are .
more than three hours into the hearing , long repeatedly pressed se@@ beli@@ us on why the &quot; architec@@ t &quot; of the affordable care act has not volun@@ tar@@ ily for@@ gone govern@@ ment@@ -@@ spon@@ so@@ red insurance to purchase a plan through health@@ care@@ .@@ go@@ v , which she is now pit@@ ching to millions of americans .
the government in jerusal@@ em fails to confirm an attack on the sy@@ ri@@ an air@@ force base
on thursday , an american government official , who w@@ ished to remain anonymous , made a statement to american news broad@@ cas@@ ter c@@ n@@ n , st@@ ating that israeli figh@@ ter plan@@ es had att@@ acked an air@@ force base in the sy@@ ri@@ an town of lat@@ ak@@ ia the day before .
the target was &quot; missi@@ les and related equipment &quot; , which the israeli government fe@@ ared were intended for the leban@@ ese he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah , according to c@@ n@@ n .
the sy@@ ri@@ an and leban@@ ese media , as well as arab@@ ic broad@@ cas@@ ter al-@@ arab@@ i@@ ya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of lat@@ ak@@ ia was fi@@ red upon during the night from wednesday to thursday , and the israel@@ is were identified as the responsible party .
israeli television broad@@ cas@@ ter channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in lat@@ ak@@ ia , in which russian s-@@ 12@@ 5 ne@@ wa@@ -@@ type defence missi@@ les and a battery of sa@@ -@@ 3 missi@@ les could be seen , which according to channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport war@@ heads weigh@@ ing up to 70 kil@@ o@@ gram@@ s .
un@@ sure , the government in jerusal@@ em has not officially confirmed the attack .
however , press agency re@@ u@@ ters has also quo@@ ted an anonymous israeli government official as saying that he believed that israel had carried out the attack , but was not sure .
in any case , a spo@@ kes@@ person for the israeli ministry of defence said : &quot; we are not comm@@ enting on these reports &quot; .
journ@@ alist ron ben@@ -@@ y@@ is@@ ha@@ i , writing for daily newspaper ye@@ di@@ oth ah@@ ron@@ oth , emphasised that the sy@@ ri@@ an regime had already previously attemp@@ ted , in some cases successfully , to deliver ground to air missi@@ les to he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah .
the israeli government had previously repeatedly war@@ ned that any attempt by syria to supply he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a &quot; red line &quot; , which would result in a military response .
john ker@@ ry says us sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately &quot; in unprecedented admission
john ker@@ ry has indicated a sof@@ ten@@ ing of the u.@@ s &apos;s def@@ ensive stance on its surveillance programmes with an unprecedented admission that on occasions its sp@@ ying has &quot; reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . &quot;
the secretary of state also ad@@ mitted that he &apos;d been guil@@ ty , along with bar@@ ack obama , of being on &quot; automatic pilot &quot; as incen@@ di@@ ary rev@@ el@@ ations from wh@@ ist@@ le@@ b@@ lower ed@@ ward snow@@ den about the n@@ sa &apos;s sp@@ ying activities emerged .
the lea@@ ks have put the us government at the centre of a diplomatic stor@@ m with its allies .
speaking to an open government conference in london via video link , mr ker@@ ry said : &quot; there is no question that the president and i and others in government have actually learned of some things that had been happening on an automatic pilot because the ability has been there , going back to world war two and to the very difficult years of the cold war , and then , of course , 9 / 11 . &quot;
he then became the first high-@@ ran@@ king member of the u.@@ s government to admit that us sp@@ ying had cros@@ sed the line , but emphasised that no one &apos;s rights had been ab@@ used .
he said : &quot; in some cases , it has reached too far in@@ appropri@@ ately . &quot;
and the president is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse .
i assure you inno@@ cent people are not being ab@@ used in this process .
mr ker@@ ry insi@@ sted , however , that the n@@ sa was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives .
he added : &quot; we &apos;re dealing in a new world where people are willing to b@@ low themselves up . &quot;
there is radical extre@@ mis@@ m in the world that is hel@@ l-@@ b@@ ent and determined to try to kill people and b@@ low people up and attack governments .
so what if you were able to inter@@ cep@@ t that and stop it before it happens ?
we have actually prevented air@@ plan@@ es from going down , buildings from being blo@@ wn up , and people from being ass@@ ass@@ inated because we &apos;ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans .
meanwhile , u.s. law@@ makers will head to europe to help address concerns abroad about alleg@@ ed u.s. sp@@ ying and convince the europeans of the need to continue joint anti-@@ terrorism efforts with the u.s. , the chairman of a sen@@ ate sub@@ committee on european affairs said on thursday .
sen@@ ator chr@@ is mur@@ ph@@ y of connec@@ tic@@ ut said he spoke with european parliament members and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-@@ terrorist organizations because of fru@@ stration over surveillance by the national security agency .
&quot; it &apos;s really important for u.s. national security interests for europeans to stay on board with us with respect to our mutual anti-@@ terrorism endeav@@ ors , &quot; mur@@ ph@@ y , a first-@@ term democr@@ at and chairman of the sen@@ ate foreign relations sub@@ committee on european affairs , said in an interview from washington .
and i &apos;m going to europe to make it clear to them that we need to continue to work together in comb@@ at@@ ting terrorism , not@@ with@@ standing their an@@ ger over these n@@ sa programs .
news reports that the n@@ sa swe@@ pt up millions of phone records in europe have fra@@ yed relations with some u.s. allies , though the agency &apos;s chief said this week that they were in@@ accurate and reflected a mis@@ understanding of met@@ ad@@ ata that nato allies collected and shared with the united states .
other rev@@ el@@ ations ci@@ ted documents le@@ ak@@ ed by snow@@ den that the n@@ sa monitored german chancell@@ or ang@@ ela mer@@ kel &apos;s cell@@ phone and those of up to 34 other world leaders .
the national intelligence director , james cla@@ pper , def@@ ended sp@@ ying on allies as necessary and said it &apos;s comm@@ on@@ place on both sides .
am@@ id the u@@ pro@@ ar , mur@@ ph@@ y said his office is arran@@ ging the cong@@ res@@ sional trip , expected to take place this year , and hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both cham@@ bers .
names of other participating law@@ makers were to be released in coming days .
he said the it@@ iner@@ ary is still being worked out .
while mur@@ ph@@ y said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships , he said some &quot; tough love &quot; will also be dispen@@ sed .
he said european leaders need to be honest with their own people about the kind of es@@ pi@@ on@@ age programs they &apos;ve used for years themselves .
&quot; while we can amend our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of europeans , they also need to come to terms with the fact that we &apos;re not the only ones that are out there sp@@ ying , &quot; mur@@ ph@@ y said .
meanwhile , mr ker@@ ry is scheduled to head this weekend to the middle east and poland to address ran@@ c@@ or over u.s. strategies in the syria , egypt and iran as well as u.s. surveillance activities .

austr@@ ali@@ an woman appe@@ als th@@ ai j@@ ail time
a 2@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old sy@@ d@@ ney woman sent@@ enced to 15 days j@@ ail in ph@@ uk@@ et for fal@@ sely claim@@ ing she was as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ted by a taxi driver is appe@@ aling the ver@@ dic@@ t and has been granted ba@@ il .
ste@@ vi@@ e ro@@ ch@@ elle b@@ am@@ ford was initially found guil@@ ty by a ph@@ uk@@ et provin@@ cial court on june 15 of making false claims after telling th@@ ai police a local taxi driver , with two other men re@@ stra@@ ining her , carried out the as@@ sa@@ ult in the early hours of sunday june 10 .
however , c@@ c@@ tv foot@@ age later revealed she had returned to her hotel safe@@ ly after becoming separated from her austr@@ ali@@ an bo@@ y@@ friend .
ph@@ uk@@ et police inter@@ viewed b@@ am@@ ford for two days before she conf@@ essed to fabric@@ ating the story .
she was held in local police cells before the court hearing .
b@@ am@@ ford was sent@@ enced to serve the 15@@ -@@ day prison term at a low security de@@ tention centre on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of ph@@ uk@@ et rather than in an adult women &apos;s j@@ ail .
she is the daughter of former austr@@ ali@@ an league player peter tun@@ ks , who has appe@@ aled to the department of foreign affairs in can@@ ber@@ ra to assist his daughter .
tun@@ ks told sy@@ d@@ ney &apos;s sunday te@@ leg@@ raph the whole family was &quot; extremely concerned &quot; about his daughter &apos;s welfare and wanted her back in australia .
&quot; it &apos;s obviously been a worrying time but we &apos;re hope@@ ful to have her back home safe@@ ly as soon as possible , &quot; tun@@ ks said .
