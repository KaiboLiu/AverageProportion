( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time staff and college graduates become main players
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal social security bureau released the latest wage guidance price for 2006 for the year of work in 2006 on the 6@@ th , with 120 positions , 11 more than the previous one . the original salary increase was lowered by 11 , while the original salary increase was lowered .
according to a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently more than 1 million employees are employed in shanghai .
according to a report by " zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , " college graduates and part - time workers are the main components of the hours - time workers force .
through the investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of them were part - time staff , with a share of 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly engaged in work with a high technical skill level , such as transl@@ ation and part - time staff ratio , to 8@@ 1.@@ 77 % , and the health and health quality of 6@@ 1.@@ 66 % .
high income is a result of the fact that many people are engaged in hours - time jobs .
it is lear@@ nt that the monthly income of individual jobs can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be difficult to find a job to do so , as if the voice is interpre@@ ted , and the monthly income of work posts can be as high as 2,000 yuan , such as con@@ sign@@ ment of financial work during the second half of the year .
and to satisfy individual interests and expand their knowledge level is also a good way to get favor@@ ite employees for part - time jobs .
for example , when a certain enterprise is the human resources department manager , mr. gu will spend a few hours to handle the financial account of a foreign representative office .
mr ko@@ o considered that the biggest gain from part - time employment was to keep up with the continuous up@@ d@@ ating of knowledge and to have the opportunity to involve another area . of course , the monthly income of 2,000 yuan also had a certain degree of en@@ tic@@ ement .
as the employment thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours of work is low , the form of work is flexible and free , and it is gradually favor@@ ed by many graduates who are job - see@@ kers , and 14@@ 4 percent of the hours of work are graduates of tertiary and secondary schools .
at first i did n't want to do an hour job , but after several months i felt it was more difficult to get a good good good good news for the work of the dprk 's ninth five - year plan .
after gradu@@ ating from university student huang xiao@@ huang , his job was not as satisfactory as he was . in the end , he hung up his name at a hotel and played the background music with a pi@@ an@@ o .
i am quite satisfied with the work now , one hour , 100 yuan , the environment , and i am now going to do a few hours of work , and looking for a few more hours .
it is learned that the hours - old work has become a practice of accumul@@ ating experience for some graduates who are job - hun@@ ting to tem@@ per their work skills and enhance communication skills to increase their social experience .
the graduates are working hours mainly in knowledge and skills , and they are more skilled in speci@@ alization , such as transl@@ ation , time - intensive evol@@ ution , and time - based performing jobs , with a ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
job - see@@ kers are not required to work in a small number of hours , such as food promotion agents and fre@@ ight deal@@ ers , etc. , and the unemployed person can be appointed through simple training .
statistics show that the number of employees who were originally unemployed was 3@@ 9.@@ 9 percent , of which the percentage of retail unemployed was 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of cat@@ ering industry to 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and the proportion of the cat@@ ering industry became an important channel for unemployed people to find jobs in an hour .

chinese expert : us pre@@ ach@@ ing military threat against china
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to support the us defense policy on arms sales to taiwan , which was submitted to the us congress a few days ago , said the white house , which is the first time in the " four - year defense assessment " report , which is officially submitted by the us congress .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the military threat theory of china is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new document for guiding national defense of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , and it directly men@@ tions two terms -- namely , china or the china , and says that m@@ ig@@ u@@ es , as a major and newly rising power , china has the greatest potential to compete with the united states in military competition , and if the united states does not adopt countermeasures , china may develop destruc@@ tive weapons and thus break the us traditional military
the chinese academy of military sciences ' world military studies department resear@@ cher yao yun@@ zhu said : although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the strategic report on national defense that china is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's m@@ old as a new strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called " sh@@ ack@@ le china military threat theory . "
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " us president bush also submitted to congress a " report on the 2007 fiscal year , " with the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if you add this to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for national defense in fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' tr@@ ick of fabr@@ icating the theory of the theory of the imper@@ ial thr@@ ust of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's inv@@ ading enemy . its purpose is to strive for more defense spending and to fish for more profits for the huge us arms industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times in the drafting of the white paper on china 's national defense , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national defense spending has generally declined .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounted for more than half of the national fiscal expenditure for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense budget was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the us national defense spending , and the per capita military spending of the people was only about one - 60 of the united states , with the per capita military spending of about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the area of us territory is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so great . who is actually the military force that exceeds the right defense need ? this is self - pro@@ claimed m@@ entary defensive .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said : the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the state of china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
china 's national defense white paper , 2004 , says that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and current im@@ pending de@@ fici@@ encies will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of beijing university 's international relations institute said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has been trying to form a cabinet to break through the border , said the official
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what new policies will hamas implement have a direct bearing on the relevant parties ' corresponding policy orientation in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future developments .
the prime minister 's position has fallen behind , and who has come ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some people outside the world were worried that hamas prime minister could be m@@ ud@@ d@@ led with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their dis@@ agreement to a hamas government that has the real right and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustment , and it is a good choice to choose an independent person .
according to reports , to obtain the international recognition as the greatest extent , hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to choose the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of j@@ ah@@ ir@@ i he@@ ir , who is independent of the islamic ji@@ had , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the premier 's position is bl@@ o@@ oming , the most crucial thing for the prime minister should try as much as possible to less@@ en the t@@ ough@@ est fla@@ v@@ or of hamas , only in this way can it guarantee the success of forming the cabinet .
how should power be distributed ?
within the party , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " shi@@ he@@ it " carried an analysis saying that hamas has gathered in the hands of people through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and is in@@ compatible with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah to jointly form a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
there is no question of whether or not a cabinet should be formed within fat@@ ah , and all factions advocate participation in the new government and thus achieve something , while the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make a legislative k@@ ick of the opposition party , which is a positive opposition party .
the informed sources pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as ' advice , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the allocation of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative yuan framework to break away from the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific name list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - like government has also become a form of cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative yuan member will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form the cabinet after the new term of office on 16 june . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course will the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another difficult problem facing the formation of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and refuse to participate in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 november that armed resistance was the strategic option of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership and management of armed forces .
hamas has been elected as the first largest party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom , and has allowed its subordinate armed factions to leg@@ alize q@@ ass@@ am brig@@ ades , which is also the way to leg@@ alize them into government security institutions .
hamas once proposed that armed forces of various factions be united as the armed forces of the palestinian people , but they did not receive a wide response , and they were also criticized by the islamic ji@@ had organization of palestine .
palestine currently has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions , which have lo@@ ose organizational relations , and also have some armed factions . for example , the pr@@ ist@@ ina of the al@@ us@@ a in sh@@ ant@@ ou .
hamas , responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are doing their own things and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate their security management rights .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , while the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of the ministry of interior .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further documents have been made .

at present , we are working for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and is also the first inland - to - land inspection station in china .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
through more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar exploration has made tremendous achievements in the world 's polar exploration , but compared with other major polar - looking countries , there is still a relatively large gap between china and the world . we must catch up with the m@@ im@@ ic .

new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) with the high - resolution digital television ( c@@ m@@ t ) , the price of high resolution television machines has continued to decline and the market has been expanding , and us television broadc@@ asters have also stepped up their efforts to introduce corresponding high - definition television programs .
the newly created super@@ m@@ ate us r@@ ow@@ m@@ er has become the american broadcasting industry 's most important play@@ er in gre@@ eting the era of high - definition television .
according to a recent report by the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill stipul@@ ating that the american broadcasting industry must stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals in an all - round manner on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and only digital signals can be broadcast .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the us television program has already set a clear timetable .
high resolution digital television on one hand depends on consumers to purchase television sets , while on the other hand , it depends on the production organization to provide high - resolution digital programs .
although digital television has been repeatedly mentioned in the past few years , it has never become a reality .
this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast by the consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets will exceed traditional television sets for the first time this year , and 8@@ 55 % of the digital television sets are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient kid@@ ney - cre@@ m@@ ation
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the japanese government has decided to develop a bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical kid@@ ney - making kid@@ ney , which is not only in the form of a separate sub@@ stitu@@ tion of human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of re@@ taining the material ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents . it is easy to trans@@ plant . with the deepening of research , it is expected to bring good to the patients with kid@@ ney disease .
according to a report by the " ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i shim@@ b@@ un , " the newly developed biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney mainly consists of two parts , and some are the arti@@ ficial fil@@ tr@@ ation of xie waste and water di@@ stances from the blood , while the other part is the re@@ entry of the cu@@ le@@ x of di@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ er cell@@ s , which is used to re@@ return to the blood , such as the original water division and the am@@ in@@ o base .
the m@@ ill made the kid@@ ney , and the m@@ ice made by the people were all made up of the sil@@ k line of the middle sky , and the inner part of the si@@ z@@ able th@@ ick la@@ yer of the cell@@ s is filled with ur@@ ine cell@@ s that dis@@ solve the function of sub@@ stitu@@ te t@@ se .
this type of sk@@ in cell@@ s can make many blood trans@@ fu@@ sion analysis causes my@@ ster@@ ious de@@ fici@@ ency , and the vari@@ ant of the product of the in@@ sec@@ t is de@@ formed into a body of in@@ sec@@ tici@@ de and return to the blood , and at the same time , can also bring the blood cell@@ s and the mineral resources that are essential to their bodies to enter the blood .
the past human kid@@ ney - making process was based on the le@@ ak@@ age of le@@ op@@ ard , and it could not be completely removed , and it was not necessary to return the ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents of am@@ mon@@ ia and other elements to the blood .
researchers used the she@@ ep to carry out bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ic@@ ine trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , using pi@@ g - pi@@ g cell@@ s on the central space sil@@ k line for arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that man - made kid@@ ney has been able to function .
they are currently developing bi@@ olog@@ ists and kid@@ ney - making kid@@ ney - making and will start clin@@ ical research after testing their safety .
china 's power production safety still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power supervision and control commission ( s@@ s@@ s@@ ic ) said on the 13@@ th that although the overall situation of power safety in 2005 remained stable , the production safety of power was still facing severe challenges .
shi yu@@ bo , vice chairman of the state electric power supervision and administration commission , said at the fifth meeting of the national power safety production committee held here that in 2005 , china 's overall power production safety was stable , and the power supply task was successfully completed , and the power supply and power supply was basically ensured , and the power supply equipment safety and general power generation accidents reduced by a big margin , and the power equipment safety and general power generation safety level was raised to a higher level .
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the supply and demand situation of power supply and the successive operation of large numbers of newly built generating units , new problems will be faced with in the production of power safety .
these challenges include the im@@ bal@@ ances of seas@@ onal def@@ ective electricity short@@ ages in some regions , the situation of power supply and demand in some areas remains tight , and the good mechanism for power - related coal prices has not taken shape , resulting in a relatively big problem in coal supply , and at the same time , the problem of reduced coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and the stable operation of power generating units will seriously affect the stable operation of some power generating units , the weak power structure ,
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be continuously exposed . how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become new problems .
in view of the work of power safety in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said : we should further strengthen the basic work of power production safety management , speed up the establishment and improvement of an emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation in power plants and networks , jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the construction of the dam , strengthen the safety management of power construction , and ensure the smooth
it is learned that in light of the new situation in power safety management , the power supervision committee will carry out revision and improvement this year the " provisional regulations on investigating an electric power production accident " promulgated . meanwhile , the relevant documents on the safety of the dam and the second system for protecting power supply will be issued successively this year .
in 2005 , china 's entire society had 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 89 - billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t - hours power , an increase of 13.@@ 4@@ 55 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand , the contradiction between coal , power , oil , and transportation is still quite conspicuous , and various power enterprises have taken effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , there was no particularly serious equipment accident in power production nationwide .
there were 74 power gr@@ id accidents , 1@@ 27 less than the same period last year , and 4@@ 27 equipment accidents were reduced by 13@@ 2 times compared with the same period last year .
south african envoy to china says there is no such thing as organizing criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the south african embassy in china ( m@@ fa ) has been working on a " new strategy " to promote the development of the south african national economy , said the minister , who is the first to be held in south africa , on wednesday .
he also said that the south african government will do everything possible to crack down on all forms of crime .
he said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero and hopes that every one of the foreigners working in south africa will be given the safety of the lives and property of the foreigners who work in south africa .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been successively killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this matter and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further strengthen their awareness of safety and precau@@ tions , and overseas chinese have strengthened unity and friendship among themselves and cooper@@ ated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we express our most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
" we are satisfied with this , " said ship@@ man , adding that the south african government is now investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese fujian woman , on 5 february , who was killed in south africa , and a suspect has been arrested .
police are now hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspects involved in the shooting of hong kong businessmen in january this year have been arrested by the south african police and the property of the victims has been recovered .
speaking on the possible impact of the chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents would indeed cast a shad@@ ow on trade between the two countries and on exchanges in other fields , and would have a negative impact . however , from a long - term perspective , the impact should not be m@@ ud@@ d@@ led .
according to the south african embassy tourism commissioner , the embassy received a total of over 2,000 chinese tourists in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 has clearly affected the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 3 percent over the same period last year .
currently there are 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and there are villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that south africa 's gap between rich and poor , high unemployment rate , and rampant gun fire have not been threatened , and therefore the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and homes , and they are more easily acc@@ es@@ sible to criminals who seek money and attack .

( winter games , stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : there is a possibility that the distribution of the nov@@ el incident may not be un@@ settled .
du@@ ling@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the news analysis : the distribution of the products may not be settled yet
xinhua news agency , k@@ ao ying
although italy repeatedly said that the winter olympics was un@@ covered during the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al , athletes who were found to be using stimul@@ ants may be confronted with the tem@@ pt@@ ation of j@@ in@@ ine . however , judging from various circumstances , this situation is unlikely to happen to the main cur@@ ti@@ s of the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al of this winter olympics , the first stimul@@ ant of the stimul@@ ant of the russian winter sports games .
the winter games in du@@ ju@@ an broke the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening of the games on the 16@@ th . o@@ . al@@ e@@ k@@ le@@ a was found using a drug - violation card .
the i@@ oc announced the next day that the dispatch of al@@ ga@@ e had been out of the winter olympics , and the two women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual med@@ als in the winter olympics had also been depriv@@ ed of .
the international winter champion@@ ships have been held on the same day , and the two - year penalty decision on the allocation of the nov@@ a race has been made .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes have been found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games and will be dis@@ qualified and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and using stimul@@ ants by athletes is a criminal act , and the judicial organ has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants and to def@@ y the law by def@@ ying the law for three to three years .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of fru@@ it@@ less barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to conduct the sports games according to the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to search the venue for athletes to stay in the olympic village , but the prote@@ sters will still be subj@@ ected to investigation by the italian prosecu@@ tor 's office .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the du@@ in@@ ness winter olympics , pe@@ ter k@@ r@@ ish@@ nan , who has handed over to the du@@ ju@@ an prosecu@@ tor 's office for the incident .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter k@@ an@@ tor have not confirmed this .
the two teams of the russian winter team , an@@ an , de@@ to@@ ov , disclosed at noon on 17 april that al@@ ex@@ a had left du@@ ling and returned to china .
he has been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that once a lev@@ a is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be unable to make a m@@ ess .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government had been playing a positive role in the fight against stimul@@ ants at the winter olympics , even if the italian prosecu@@ tor had really got involved in this matter , it would be hard to say .
according to the old italy 's judgment on the use of stimul@@ ants by its own athletes , the maximum penalty for the in@@ mates is nothing but a two year imprisonment suspended for two years and a cur@@ ve for execution of m@@ iti@@ g@@ ation .
therefore , p@@ es@@ a senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re , who is a senior reporter of the italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ a news agency , said that it is very difficult to make a m@@ ess in the prison , and that the most likely amount is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be held in a abs@@ ence of trial , the italian police could not possibly have sent al@@ ga@@ e to foreign countries to take the sentence back .
if al@@ ga@@ e refused to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would have no way to take her .

the preliminary test results of the den@@ mark national veter@@ inary administration also showed that 30 dead sw@@ ans were not infected with the avian flu virus .
