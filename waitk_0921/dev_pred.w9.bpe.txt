according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai labor and social security bureau , currently the number of hours working in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a report in the china youth daily , college graduates and part - time workers are the major component of the h@@ our@@ ly contingent .
through direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , over half of the staff are part - time personnel , and the proportion of them is 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly engaged in the work of relatively technical , such as transl@@ ation jobs , part - time personnel ratio as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7@@ 7 % , and fit@@ ness of 6@@ 1.@@ 6 % .
the high income is an important reason why many people are engaged in the work of concurrently working hours .

to satisfy individual interest and to expand their knowledge - based field is also an important reason why the employees are interested in joining the same job hours .
for example , when mr. gu , a manager of a certain enterprise , is a manager of human resources department , he will take several hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign mer@@ ch@@ ant representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the biggest earn@@ ings from the con@@ current position was that his knowledge had been constantly updated , and that he had the opportunity to involve another field . of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had a certain degree of en@@ tic@@ ement .
as the employment thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours is low , the work style is flexible and free , and many of the graduates currently seeking employment are gradually favor@@ ed , 14@@ 4 % of them are college and secondary school graduates who have been working in the past three years .
at the beginning , i did not want to do an hour work , but after several months i felt it was better than the nine to five days to work .
after gradu@@ ating from university , the college graduate , huang did not find his job as satisfactory . finally , he hung up in a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am very satisfied with my present work , at one hour 100 yuan , and the environment is good . what i want to do now is to find a few hours of work .
it is learned that an hour - long work has become a job - see@@ ker who has accumulated experience in work and has improved his skills in work and communication skills .
the graduates are working hours mainly in a knowledge - based and techn@@ ically - skilled job - transl@@ ation posts , such as higher - professional transl@@ ation posts , a strong age - oriented performing arts , with a ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
the technical requirements for some of the jobs are not high , such as food promotion promotion promotion personnel , fre@@ sh@@ men , etc. , and the unemployed personnel can be appointed through simple training .
the data shows that among the employees working in the h@@ ire , the proportion of those working in the middle and the number of unemployed in the retail sector reached 3@@ 9@@ ,000 , of which the proportion of the unemployed in retail business reached 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of cat@@ ering and cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and that an hour - time job became an important channel for the employment of unemployed personnel .

prc expert : us ' prov@@ oc@@ ative ' military threat ' un@@ justi@@ fi@@ able accus@@ ation
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to grant the right to the united states a " four - year defense review " to the congress recently , which is the most likely challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is unreasonable accus@@ ations against china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the china military threat theory is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report exp@@ ounds on china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt in three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s , directly men@@ tions 15 times to two phr@@ ases : china or china 's influence , and the two phr@@ ases of china 's population , which are major and emerging powers , china has the greatest potential to engage in military competition with the united states . if the united states does not adopt counter measures , china will very likely develop its military superiority and thus destroy its traditional
yao yun@@ zhu , a resear@@ cher at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defined russia 's nuclear power as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially its so - called china threat theory .
major general peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted a government budget for fiscal year 2007 to congress on the same day , including $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion for national defense budget .
if the p@@ aw@@ n plus the additional budget for military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , setting a new historical high , peng guang@@ qian said , this is almost the same as the total amount of military expenditure of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said that the us tr@@ ick of fabr@@ icating the threat of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's do@@ ings of the enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense spending and to gain more profits for the huge us arms industrial bloc .
according to experts , compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has been a military expert who has participated in many times in the chinese national defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of china 's national defense expenditure in the same period has shown a trend of decline .
official data show that in comparison with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounted for nearly 10 percentage points of the national financial expenditure for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 trillion yuan , only about 1 / 14 of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people was only about 1 / 60 of the united states , and the per capita military spending was about one - third of the us military 's .
the size of the united states ' territory is r@@ oughly the same as that of china 's territory , but the difference in military expenditure is huge , and it is not to mention who 's military strength exceeds the proper defense needs .
peng guang@@ qian said :
director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become oppon@@ ents in the military field in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly takes the path of peaceful development and impl@@ ements a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been fo@@ ol@@ ed in the past and now , and will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed over 100,000 troops in asia alone .
zhu feng , professor at the institute of international relations of beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively promote constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet building
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has found a breakthrough in forming a cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 17 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative election , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world .
what kind of new policy will hamas implement will directly affect the corresponding policy orientation of the various parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that involve future development .
the prime minister 's post has left no one .
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people outside were worried that the hamas prime minister might have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader mar@@ shall , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government headed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international concerns .
the united states and israel explicitly expressed their dis@@ agreement to a hamas government that holds real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting the independent is a policy of compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international approval as much as possible , hamas leaders at home and abroad who had gathered in egypt recently decided to choose the chairman of the board of directors of the sha@@ h@@ b@@ ar islamic university , j@@ ah@@ mad@@ i - me@@ h@@ r@@ ar@@ i , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been received by the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in hos@@ se@@ in said that the most important thing in the prime minister 's appointment is to play down hamas 's tough - minded character as much as possible , and that only by doing so can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to distribu@@ te power ( sub@@ head )
within the palestinian territories , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian newspaper " shi@@ '@@ a " carried an analysis saying that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but in governing , it lacks experience and has a close cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the governing experience .
hamas proposed to establish political partners with fat@@ ah after the election and jointly set up a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive response to this day .
at present , there are different opinions within fat@@ ah on whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government , thus doing something . another faction refused hamas 's invitation . it is willing to be a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that , in the dis@@ su@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a cabinet that is independent of par@@ tis@@ an aff@@ iliation outside the framework of the legislative council .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government can no longer be regarded as a form of forming a cabinet that can ligh@@ ten external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council took office on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course to follow in arming the people ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel have taken a very tough attitude , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and refuse to participate in government affairs with guns .
hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces are in fact two levels of the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas elected as first largest legislative party through democratic and free means , and it has made its subordinate armed factions , the same as the p@@ aw@@ n of the government , the way to bring them into line with the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to re@@ unify all factions into the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a wide response , and was also met with a protest by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ a@@ af@@ ar ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions , such as the pan@@ as@@ onic marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , whose organization relations are lo@@ ose , such as the pan@@ ama of the ar@@ s@@ ay@@ a marty@@ rs .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own administration and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , while the new government 's internal affairs department is under centralized control .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further report has been made .

sun zhi@@ hui , director of the state oce@@ an@@ ic administration , said :
the " report " shows that on 24 march 2005 , the 21 st ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion team of china successfully completed its mission to return to shanghai . the inspection lasted 15@@ 1 days and was 2,@@ 6@@ 500 n@@ au@@ tical miles .

as the polar investigation report published by china for the first time , the " 2005 china polar inspection report " also set forth the requirements for china 's polar expedi@@ tion , which started in the 1980 s .
according to the " report , " china formally joined the " ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty " in 198@@ 3 , becoming a member of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty organization , and successively becoming a member of the council of directors of the ant@@ arc@@ tic council of the ant@@ arc@@ tic council of the ant@@ arc@@ tic council of science research council of the ant@@ arc@@ tic council of consultation countries , the advisory council of nan@@ polar science research council of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty in 2003 .
in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee , and won the right to speak and make decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 - odd years , china has been able to see the extreme from the v@@ ant@@ age point of its development , its original scale , and its existing system of scientific inspection of nan@@ bi@@ polar science , a three - stop , and a three - le@@ g , namely , the chang@@ cheng station established in february 198@@ 5 , the nan@@ polar middle - mountain station established in february 1989 , the huang@@ he station established in july 2004 , and the nor@@ theast@@ ern
statistics in the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific expedi@@ tions for two times , using the s@@ now@@ y dragon boat as its p@@ ing@@ ping station 's northern pol@@ e scientific expedi@@ tion inspection tour . so far more than 3,000 inspec@@ tors from the country have visited the n@@ ati@@ i pol@@ es on - site inspection .
at present , we are building the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and also the first inland survey station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar expedi@@ tion has occupied a position in the world 's polar inspection , but it is still far from the fact that there is a big gap between china and other major polar countries . we must catch up with our heads and catch up with our own feet .
he said .
sun zh@@ ili disclosed that china will publish the polar inspection report every year .

the us has gradually become the mainstream digital tv .
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the world 's largest producer of television sets ( the domin@@ i@@ que ) has been dec@@ lining and the market has been expanding along with the continuous decline in the prices of high - resolution television sets ( the " le - yang " ) .
the newly - dis@@ appeared american super - american star - m@@ ere - m@@ ere ol@@ ive branch soccer has become a hot spot for american broadcasting industry to gre@@ et the tv era .
according to a recent report by the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill , which stipulates that us broadcasting industry must completely stop broadcasting the current m@@ ock television signal on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and can only broadcast a digital signal .
this means that the overall dig@@ iti@@ zation of the us television programs has already been set on a clear timetable .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the us consumer electronics association , the sales of digital television sets in the united states this year will exceed traditional tv sets for the first time , while 8@@ 5@@ -@@ 5 percent of the digital television sets are high - resolution products .
the japanese researchers developed a new type of highly efficient human kid@@ ney .
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research and development of a bi@@ om@@ ass kid@@ ney by researchers at the japanese east china sea university not only has the same function as human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of maintaining the material component , and is small and easy to trans@@ plant . with the research in - depth , it is expected that the kid@@ ney - like virus will bring benefits to the patients .
according to a recent report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological kid@@ ney mainly consists of two parts , and some are the kid@@ ney - pow@@ ered ne@@ ed@@ le of the patients who are fil@@ tr@@ ated from blood and are divided into water . the other is the re@@ birth of the bre@@ a@@ thing pip@@ es of the people who have been rec@@ l@@ aiming blood from such sources as the pl@@ um@@ me@@ i@@ di@@ o@@ tic di@@ ox@@ ide of the former lieutenant general di@@
the pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t and the or@@ ang@@ e of the man 's bre@@ a@@ thing are made up of the middle sky 's w@@ ire line , and the side of the ch@@ or@@ us of the human bre@@ ed pip@@ es also filled with the br@@ ain of the function of dec@@ o@@ y .
this type of sk@@ in cell can make many blood analysis of the diseases caused by blood trans@@ fu@@ sion , and the inter@@ related nature of the vari@@ ant of the vari@@ ant of the vari@@ ant of the vari@@ ant of the material , which is a material dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy and can also enable the re@@ entry of the gl@@ uc@@ ose , the gl@@ uc@@ ose , and the mineral material needed for the body to the blood .
in the past , the human kid@@ ney used to rely on the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy of le@@ th@@ al pressure to dis@@ pose of the waste , and it was not qualified to return the components of the hydr@@ og@@ en and other components to the blood .
the researchers used the h@@ ills to conduct bio@@ human kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , and the use of the pi@@ g - based s@@ kin@@ s in the middle - air w@@ ire of human - made kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the human - made kid@@ ney had already been able to function .
at present , they are developing and using the bio@@ human kid@@ ney cell of human kid@@ ney cell@@ s and will start clin@@ ical research after testing their safety .

south africa 's envoy to china said there was no such thing as the organization of sex@@ ual abuse against chinese citizens in south africa

he also said that the south african government will do its utmost to crack down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every country working in south africa will have a safe life and property to be fully protected by local law and citizens , said the minister .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed widespread concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security precau@@ tions .
we express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
" we are very sor@@ ry about this and we also invite the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the killing of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing on 5 february in south africa , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now tracking down another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminals suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen were arrested by south africa police in january this year , and the victims ' bel@@ ong@@ ings have been recovered .
on the impact of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents are indeed very important to trade between the two countries and exchanges in other fields . however , in the long run , influence should not be great .
according to the information given by the south african embassy 's tourism commissioner , n@@ ab@@ il m@@ be@@ y , the embassy issued a visa to more than 2,000 chinese in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa will continue to maintain china 's position as the biggest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent from the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' death in 2004 have a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , there were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists in the first half of 2005 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and they are spread across the cities and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is large , the unemployment rate is high , and fire@@ arms are rampant , and there is no deterr@@ ence of death penalty , so the crime rate is still high .
as many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and their homes , and this is even more easy to become the target of criminals seeking money .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : it is possible that the issue of the le@@ av@@ age incident will be settled without the sligh@@ test result .
du@@ sh@@ an@@ be , february 17 ( xinhua ) the issue of the le@@ av@@ a is likely to be settled without delay , according to a press analysis
xinhua news agency , gao y@@ ining ,
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , it has been discovered that the athletes who use stimul@@ ant may face resistance to the dev@@ ast@@ ation of the j@@ ail , and judging from various circumstances , such a situation is not likely to happen in the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al at this olympic games , two athletes in the su@@ z@@ uk@@ ov@@ ic , the mon@@ te of the mon@@ te d@@ ent@@ l@@ on , russia , are still in the mid@@ st of various circumstances .
du@@ bl@@ in 's first case of stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening of the d@@ avo@@ s winter olympics on 16 february was discovered by the police , ob@@ vi@@ an was found to have used a drug - free drug card .
the following day , the i@@ oc announced that it had sent out len@@ ovo out of the winter olympics , and she received 15 - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ als for the two women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ als at this winter olympics .
the two international winter events alliance made a decision on the two - year ban on the distribution of the pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic .
the i@@ oc has been providing that athletes have been found to have used stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and they will be eliminated and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the s@@ port carrying and using stimul@@ ants bel@@ ongs to criminal acts , and the judicial organ has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ant athletes and to def@@ y the law by def@@ ying the law for three months to three years .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement after the two sides agreed to make a deal in accordance with italian law during the winter olympics to handle the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants .
with the unremitting efforts of the i@@ oc , the italian side made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the place where athletes are stationed , but the athletes who are positive in the medic@@ ation will still be subject to investigation by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government 's official per@@ e@@ z , who supervis@@ es the du@@ bl@@ in winter olympics , has already handed over the re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ation of the d@@ oping incident to du@@ bl@@ an@@ be 's procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter s@@ co@@ tt have not confirmed this .
two teams in russian winter , and@@ re@@ i , revealed at noon on 17 november that he had sent len@@ a v@@ in@@ as to leave tur@@ in and return to china .
he has served in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng believes that once he sent his family back to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ certain for many years .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have never been completely resolved on the issue of anti - stimul@@ ant d@@ oping at the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ ed in this matter , the result would be un@@ certain .
according to the previous judgment and pen@@ alties for the use of stimul@@ ant agents by italian athletes , the most important punishment that the banned persons receive is no more than two years of imprisonment and a bu@@ f@@ fer period .
therefore , p@@ el@@ e , a senior reporter of the italian ant@@ a society , said that the possibility of le@@ av@@ a entering the prison was very small , and that the most was a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a short period , italian police could not possibly send le@@ av@@ ers to other countries to take their sentences back .
if they send a v@@ in@@ cent to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take it .
