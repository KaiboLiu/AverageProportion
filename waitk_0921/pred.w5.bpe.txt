( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time staff and college graduates become the main force of work
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau issued the latest figures on industrial wages guidance prices for 2006 , with the number of posts reaching 120 , an increase of 11 from the previous increase , and the original job turn@@ around has fallen .
according to the relevant experts of the shanghai labor and social security bureau , shanghai 's hour workers and workers have already exceeded 1 million .
according to a report by the zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , college graduates and part - time workers are the main components of the team of hours workers .
through the investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time workers , with their ratio reaching 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 11 percent .
the level of part - time workers is generally higher , and their main job is to be engaged in relatively high technical work , such as transl@@ ation jobs , the proportion of part - time workers is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7@@ 9 % , and the health category is 6@@ 1.@@ 66 % .
high income is the result of many people engaging in hours of work and part - time jobs .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be hard to seek , just like a sound of transl@@ ation , so the monthly income of hours of work can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time financial mar@@ ital instruments .
and to satisfy the individual 's interest in expanding his knowledge is also a good thing that has been favor@@ ed by working in a part - time job .
for example , when a company is the manager of the human resources department , he will take several hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign business representative office .
mr ko@@ o considered that the maximum benefits of his part - time job were to keep his knowledge updated and that he had the opportunity to touch on another area , of course , the income of the yuan 2000 per month also had a certain degree of appeal .
as employment of some hours of work is low , the form of flexible and free work is gradually affected by the gl@@ o@@ be of many graduates who are seeking employment , 14@@ 3 % of the hours of work are graduates of secondary and secondary schools in the past three years .
i did not want to work for an hour at the beginning , but after i finished a few months , i felt it was better to work for the fifth night of the ninth dynasty .
after gradu@@ ating from the university , the work that he found was not as satisfactory as he did . finally , he hung his name at a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play the background music .
the work now is very satisfactory , and i have 100 yuan per hour , the environment is good , and i am now looking for more hours .
it is understood that the work of an hour has become a part of the work experience accumulated by some graduates who are now seeking jobs , and an important way to improve their communication skills and social records .
the job of graduates is mainly focused on knowledge and skills , and the job is mainly concentrated on jobs with a higher degree of speci@@ alization , with a strong sense of acting , a strong sense of age , and a strong proportion of arti@@ sts , including 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
the skills of hours of work and part of the job are not high , such as food promo@@ ters and fre@@ ight agents , and the unemployed personnel can be appointed through simple training .
data show that the number of hours of work workers was 3@@ 9@@ ,000 , of which the proportion of unemployed personnel in the retail category was 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of restaurants and be@@ ver@@ ages was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ percent , and the number of hours of work became an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

anhui should firmly grasp the major opportunity to promote the rise of central china and always adhere to the central task of economic construction without w@@ aver@@ ing , conscientiously implement the central principles and policies in close connection with anhui 's actual conditions , cre@@ atively carry out work , and implement the scientific development concept in concrete measures and in actual work .
we should sum up practical experience in a timely manner , fully rely on the masses , vigorously support reform and innovation , and constantly open up a new situation in anhui 's work .
we should actively promote the building of a harmonious society and persistently take the realization of the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the starting point and end point of all our work , actively create conditions , and gradually resolve the practical problems of the masses in difficulty , gradually adjust the distribution relations , gradually change the gap between urban and rural areas , and safeguard and realize social fairness and justice , so that all the people can share the results of reform and development .
wu bangguo stressed : china has already reached the stage where it must rely more on enhancing its ability to independently innovate and improving the quality of labor@@ ers to promote economic and social development . only by vigorously promoting scientific and technological progress and innovation can we achieve a qu@@ al@@ itative leap in productive forces and promote economic and social development to truly enter the track of scientific development .
we should establish and perfect as quickly as possible a system and mechanism favorable to innovation , increase investment in science and technology , encourage patent inv@@ en@@ tions , develop famous br@@ ands , speed up the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces , strengthen the position of enterprises as the main body of independent innovation , and continuously raise the contribution of scientific and technological progress to economic growth .
we must support and encourage the participation of key technological elements in distribution , and establish and perfect the statistical inde@@ xes system that embodies the ability to independently innovate . we must study and formulate policies for supporting independent innovation in finance and government procurement , and form a policy system that encourages independent innovation .
we should nur@@ ture a sense of innovation in the whole society , vigorously advocate the spirit of d@@ aring to innovate and boldly compete , and strive to create a good atmosphere of talent coming forth in large numbers .
wu bangguo pointed out : the npc has played an important role in ruling the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .
to do a good job in the work of the people 's congress in the new situation , we must , first , uphold the correct political orientation , unswervingly follow the path of socialist political development with chinese characteristics , and organ@@ ically integrate the adherence to the party 's leadership over the people as masters of their own affairs and the rule of the country according to law .
second , we should closely center our work around the overall situation of the party and the state , closely centering on major issues in reform , development , and stability , and work closely around hot and difficult issues of common concern to the masses of the people , and continually enhance the effectiveness of the npc 's work .
third , it is necessary to give play to the characteristics and advantages of the npc 's work , persist in democratic centr@@ alism , act in strict accordance with the procedures , and coll@@ ectively decide the problems .
we must adhere to the mass line , take people as the foundation , exercise power for the people , be concerned with the people , and work for the people .

chinese expert : us pre@@ aches military threat to china
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to cut the number of arms sales to congress by a year to a record of 4@@ th year , according to the pentagon , which is expected to pose a challenge to the united states in military affairs .
experts believe that this is a major contribution to china 's normal national defense construction , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the military threat from china , and interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new document of the pentagon 's national defense guidance .
this 92 - page report has been published in three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s on china 's military strength and the us 's countermeasures , and the report has directly mentioned 15 times the history of china 's diplomacy of either the sp@@ ann@@ ing or the c@@ ann@@ es of china , and it says that china , as a major and emerging power , has the greatest potential to carry out military competition with the united states . if the united states does not adopt anti - control measures , china will probably develop its military weapons
professor xu shi@@ quan , research fellow of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its master of the national defense strategy that china is the emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia 's b@@ og@@ us as the newly emerging strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called " b@@ og@@ us military threat " .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report , " us president bush also submitted a draft resolution to congress on the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year , with the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if it is added to the military exercises in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian held that the us fabr@@ ication of the false unilater@@ alism of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's tr@@ um@@ pe@@ t of the enemy , and its real purpose is to obtain more national defense funds and to seek more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry group .
experts say that compared with the enormous us military expenditure , china 's national defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has participated in the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has written many times the chinese defense white paper , said : since the 199@@ 0s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the state 's financial expenditure has generally shown a down@@ ward trend .
official data show that the figure for 2004 is only about 1 % of the national defense expenditure for the same period compared with 1979 .
china 's national defense budget for 2005 is 24@@ 6.@@ 56 billion yuan renminbi , only about one - quarter of the united states , and the per - capita military expenditure is only about 1 / 60 of the united states , and the per - capita military expenditure is about 1 / 30 of the us military .
the us territory area and china 's territorial area are generally quite similar , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge . who exactly is the military strength going beyond the proper defense needs ? this is something that is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily in the future .
the " chinese national defense in 2004 " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been as good as any other country in the past or at present .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , and the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , only having deployed more than 10@@ 0,000 troops in the region .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas ass@@ ails cabinet to break through
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has formed cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policy will hamas implement directly affect the interests of the parties concerned in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the united states and israel have adopted a more flexible approach in resisting the hamas government 's future .
at present , the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points of the formation of a cabinet that involve future developments .
premier posts spend money on which family
hamas has been the only country in the world since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people are worried that hamas 's prime minister will probably have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , visiting hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ m@@ ali@@ er stressed that the new palestinian government , which was set up by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that has the real power and threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and hand over tax to the palestinian side .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a dis@@ astr@@ ous policy to choose independent candidates .
it is reported that in order to obtain the most international recognition , hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to choose independent j@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , chairman of the board of directors of the saudi grand school , j@@ im@@ my , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the prime minister 's job is spent , the most important thing is that the candidate of the prime minister should play down as much as possible the hard - pressed color of hamas , only by so doing can it be guaranteed the success of the cabinet formation .
power , distribution of power , distribution of power
from the internal perspective , the biggest challenge facing hamas 's cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the " daily " of palestine analyzed that hamas 's social welfare program has attracted people 's attention , but in the aspect of governing , it lacks experience and is in@@ compatible with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governance .
hamas proposed a new peace accord with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly formed a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
there are still some problems in the fat@@ ah internal affairs , such as whether or not they will enter the cabinet , one faction advocating participation in the new government , and the other is rej@@ ecting hamas 's invitation , and the other is willing to play a positive role in the legisl@@ ature .
the informed source pointed out that in ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ ans toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to form a legislative committee framework that is divor@@ ced from the party 's cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is no longer a way to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative committee takes office on 16 february . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
armed forces should be the only way to go from being armed
hamas 's weapons are the most important task for forming a new government .
the united states and israel have taken a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect the use of arms to participate in government and political affairs .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ m@@ ali@@ er stressed on 9 november that armed resistance was the strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the control of the armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , has been elected as the first party of the legislative council , and has been recognized internationally , so that its subordinate armed factions will be able to legi@@ tim@@ ize the process of legi@@ tim@@ izing the cabinet to unify it with the government security organs .
hamas once proposed to re@@ unify the armed forces of various factions to the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a broad response and was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ em@@ ir ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organization relations with the armed factions , such as the ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of marty@@ rs in al-@@ aq@@ sa , and the haw@@ ks of the fat@@ ah .
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are all in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security control power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense and other organs , and the interior ministry of the new government will be under control .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no specific document has been made .

in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee and won the right to speak and decision on international extreme affairs .
the " report " pointed out that china 's ul@@ tr@@ a - sl@@ ated exploration of things has never been so far as to develop , and the initial scale of the survey has become a nor@@ ther@@ ly - mon@@ g@@ ol observation system in the three stations . the first one is to examine the arc@@ tic science . that is , the chang@@ cheng station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic pol@@ e in february 198@@ 5 , the central mountain station in february 1989 , the northern pol@@ e base , and the yellow river pol@@
statistics from the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 research meetings in ant@@ arc@@ tic science to study the two major scientific research projects , with the two - batch research project of the northern pol@@ e , which is a platform of plat@@ forms , on the two sides , to examine the yellow river station in the arc@@ tic . up to now , more than 3,000 people have visited the southern pol@@ e in person and conducted on - the - spot inspection .
at present , we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and is also china 's first inland inspection station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's ul@@ tr@@ a - polar exploration has occupied a large place in the world 's polar exploration , but it is still far from being quite far from being compared with other major polar countries . we must catch up with one another and catch up with one another .
he said .
sun zh@@ iz@@ ai disclosed that china will publish an ul@@ tr@@ a - looking report every year .

according to a recent report by the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill , stipul@@ ating that american broadcasting operators must completely stop broadcasting the existing simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and only send digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the us tv program has already been clearly set .

the south african embassy in china said that there is no such thing as organized crimes against chinese citizens in south africa
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has made great efforts to promote the development of the south african country 's economy , said a senior official here thursday .
he also said that the south african government will do its utmost to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu said the south african government hopes to reduce the rate of crime to zero , and hopes that each of the foreigners working in south africa will be able to secure the safety of their lives and property .
since 2006 , four senior chinese citizens have been holding a meeting in south africa , and the chinese world has shown broad concern over this .
the chinese ministry of foreign affairs has made representations to the south african side and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship among the overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we will express the most sincere sympathy and sympathy to the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we regret this and ask china 's people to believe that the south african government is now conducting a serious investigation of each case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully solved the case of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing killed in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of suspects suspected of shooting the hong kong business@@ man in january this year has been arrested by south african police and the victims ' property has been recovered .
on the incident of chinese citizens being killed , the chinese government said that the incident was indeed a big threat to the relations between the two countries and the trade , tourism and other fields .
the south african embassy tourism commissioner , n@@ el@@ son n@@ ou@@ i , told the chinese embassy that the embassy had provided more than 2,000 visitors to south africa only in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner of africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , an increase of 2@@ 23 percent over the same period last year .
however , people from the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
south africa 's tourism bureau statistics show that china 's tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent from the same period last year .
the chinese people living in south africa now have about 200,000 , and the towns and villages in south africa are all sc@@ attered .
analysts here believe that the social dispar@@ ity between south africa and the rich and the poor is wide , the unemployment rate is high , and there is no threat to death , so the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english , there are cash in their bodies and their families , and this is more likely to become the target of the criminal 's financial attack .

( the winter olympics , the d@@ oping ag@@ ent ) news analysis : it is possible that the dispatch of the le@@ av@@ ers incident will be an un@@ settled one .
du@@ an , february 17 ( xinhua ) the press analysis said that the dispatch of le@@ av@@ ers is likely to be the end of the event
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly claimed that the winter olympics will be un@@ earth@@ ed , the use of stimul@@ ants will be faced with the problem of the sp@@ ine , but the games are now taking a look at the situation in this winter , which is not likely to occur in the main character of the scand@@ al of the first bo@@ xing scand@@ al of the os@@ ce in this year .
the winter olympics in du@@ an has brought out the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the games on 16 june . o ' lei police con@@ sole was discovered to have used more than 30 drug - related cards .
the i@@ oc announced the following day that it had sent le@@ av@@ ers out of the winter olympics , and she had won two gold med@@ als in the winter olympics . the silver med@@ al for the 15 - kilome@@ ter individual games was also stri@@ pped .
the international winter 2 alliance was established on the same day to impose a two - year pen@@ alties on the allocation of the asian - pacific bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball games .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes should be discovered to use stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and will be dis@@ missed and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but will not be punished according to law .
however , according to italian law , the number of people carrying and using stimul@@ ants is a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and the law - break@@ ers are still facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
in december last year , after a long period of one year , the i@@ oc and the italian government finally reached an agreement on the return of the b@@ at price . both sides agreed to handle the issue of the athletes using stimul@@ ants in accordance with the italian law during the current winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy has made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that the police will not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place during the winter olympics . however , the drug prosecu@@ tors will still be subject to investigation by italian procuratorial organs .
it has been reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the du@@ in winter olympics , per@@ ry , has sent le@@ ov@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to du@@ an 's procuratorate .

russia 's winter 2 team team team , and@@ re@@ i dem@@ k@@ of@@ i , revealed at noon on 17 july that the re@@ education sent le@@ ov@@ a had left du@@ an and returned to china .
he was once a member of the chinese sports officials who had worked in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agency for many years . he said that once the p@@ ap@@ ul@@ a was sent back to china , this incident could eventually be concluded without a single conclusion .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great progress in the anti - d@@ oping of the winter olympics , and even if the italian procuratorial organs have indeed made a success in the matter , it will be hard to say the result will be very difficult .
according to the previous italian policy of using stimul@@ ants to athletes in their country , the pen@@ alties imposed by the banned are only two years of imprisonment , but the two years of imprisonment of suspended execution .
therefore , senior italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ a reporter le@@ i@@ el@@ i said that the possibility of sending le@@ ov@@ a to the j@@ ails is almost the same , and most of the is the fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a abs@@ ence , the italian police could not go abroad to send le@@ ov@@ a back to take the sentence .
if the le@@ op@@ ard ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will also have no way to take her .
