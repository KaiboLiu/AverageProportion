experts believe that insurance cu@@ sh@@ ion will not diver@@ t domestic stock funds in the short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , beijing , july 30 c
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures on the management of offshore investment of insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for use in the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's li@@ u@@ yang company , believes that the renminbi 's appreciation and the domestic capital market are getting better , and insurance will not be able to make large - scale investment through foreign exchange purchase in the near future . this also means that insurance will not diver@@ t domestic stock market funds in the short term .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same views .
experts said that since there is no such market as the renminbi ch@@ illed products , insurance institutions are not capable of taking risks , the time is not ri@@ pe for large - scale foreign exchange purchases .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long term , in the area of asset allocation , foreign investment should have a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the renminbi is under a relatively large pressure for its appreciation , china 's sun@@ ni bro@@ thers will mainly use their own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
in the current situation , we should treat the purchase of foreign exchange with cau@@ tion .

according to a report by taiwan 's " chu@@ ang " , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned judge + chang chun - chi@@ u or investig@@ ators on 30 june , because of political or election considerations , and was involved in the incident and even attempted to influence the election campaign of various party candidates . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it was very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , yu yue - sheng , president of the department of justice , responded not to the call . fan ku@@ ang - chun , secretary general , also spoke on the issue of the judicial affairs of the han dynasty .
gao jin@@ zhi said that the fundamental law and the rules of the judges on taiwan 's legal system both clearly and definitely declare that judges should go beyond the party and should not participate in party activities , nor should they help the election judges . judges are very cautious about relevant restr@@ aints , and judges are very cautious in their handling of the judicial affairs .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that xiao sheng@@ xi , a native of kaohsiung 's xiao@@ yang city , was glad to attend the k@@ ad@@ ag@@ an school course several years ago , that is , the disciplinary committee , which was formed by judges , was punished because the courses had the color of political parties .

germany to lower entry thre@@ sh@@ old for specialized talent
the staff headquarters of the pla , in ber@@ lin , 1 july ( reporter wang huai@@ cheng )
german minister of education and scientific research sch@@ w@@ ab said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign specialized personnel in " li@@ ku@@ d " and resolve the problem of professional talent facing germany through increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
according to o@@ ec@@ d 's report , the number of labor force between 15 and 64 will decline year by year .
if there is no enough migr@@ ation , then the labor force in germany will be 6 percent lower than the current level .
however , the federation of german employers and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that in germany 's labor market , engine@@ ers ' professional skills are quite popular .
according to data from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , the supply of skilled workers in germany 's labor market was about 1@@ 27@@ 0,000 , and the supply of some 9@@ ,@@ 600 people .
germany has set up a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent in order to protect its own employment .
the " su@@ ite law " of germany stipulates that the professional talent of non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be allowed to work and stay in germany .
he suggested that this limit be lowered to the level of popular ri@@ f@@ le euro .

the " law of lawyers " revised article 8 of the draft amendment recently submitted to the npc standing committee stipulates : those who have engaged in research on legal affairs , such as my@@ ong teaching , and who have a high level of expertise like th@@ in r@@ ock and similar to others , who apply for a solic@@ itor 's practi@@ sing profession , are subject to the examination and approval of the judicial administrative department of the state council , and are allowed to be released to practi@@ se their profession .

the law has a theoretical cl@@ arity and a solid foundation for the study of marxist theory , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and so on . the latter is more specific behavior involving li@@ tig@@ ation , legal consultation , legal consultation , legal services , and legal services .
for a long time , the theoretical circles of law and the traditional affairs of the han dynasty have been l@@ oud and th@@ in , and the theoretical circles of the lu yu yu - han believe that the real and contemporary chinese are l@@ acking in necessary . only the true - style leg@@ alists of the law , and the truth - seeking and pragmatic people are critici@@ zing the theoretical circles of the han dynasty , and the criticism of the theory is not the way to guide practice .
the law can do so by such differences in division of labor , by maintaining the fr@@ ay , and by not supporting any party .
however , the impl@@ ant cl@@ on@@ ion cl@@ um@@ sy in the law of lawyers , however , obj@@ ectively recognized that the theoretical circles of laws should be more than the law 's , the law 's , and the rule of law should be higher than the law 's actual and popular judg@@ ments .
in fact , some research on purely theoretical studies and teaching methods , such as the law of the legal system , have been closely linked with the practice of law , and with the practice of the theory .
this way , the leg@@ end@@ ary lawyers ' lo@@ os@@ ened into the confu@@ sion of qualifications in the legal profession , a bad gu@@ y that had an extremely bad influence .
the super@@ sti@@ tion in theoretical circles is not limited to these , such as expert x@@ ion and experts ' argu@@ ments that they will often influence or even ve@@ to court verdic@@ ts , and this is also the direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

the british government lowered the level of terrorist attack from the highest level to the most serious level , indicating that the terrorist attacks in britain will not occur soon , but the attack is still very likely to be like a th@@ ick .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the investigation scope to india and australia .
since all the eight suspects arrested were working in the medical system , the government will have a comprehensive emergency review of the background of the migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .

the di@@ agr@@ ams of tourism and di@@ agr@@ ams are the lo@@ ose and clear - cut , and they enjoy the fruits of natural and social civilization to the greatest extent .
however , many people are suffering from such a worry , as they are being taken by traders and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , the upper body of the cars will always be faced with the cru@@ el fight between small traders and some non - licensed intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling su@@ ite - like bur@@ ning p@@ akes , that is , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then introducing food without a license , and even using fake papers and fr@@ ames to spread the food and drink , as well as the intermedi@@ ary who does not have a license to introduce food and drink , or even to spread fake items .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and it 's a big un@@ successful move .
many of them also feel the same in some scen@@ ery and on@@ light .
if you do n't get on the door , some people will come to travel on the fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant and small hot items .
after entering the door , this situation will be more , and then the good y@@ a@@ xing was also exposed to m@@ istr@@ ust .
some media reported that many foreign tourists to xian had an un@@ ending pra@@ ise for the mon@@ uments in xian , but they were very much concerned about the fact that they allowed the many pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ kers who had been re@@ st@@ ling their p@@ oc@@ kets to be sold .
these include the fl@@ ash@@ light and bre@@ wing , which is the place that dri@@ ves and cu@@ ts , and should be civilized , peaceful , and harmonious , and give a light - hear@@ ted environment .
the free che@@ ers of the traders and the conf@@ used hearts of the people do not say that obj@@ ectively they have under@@ min@@ ed the public order of these people , forming pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , they also provide some conditions and opportunities for them .
what is important is that these are window wind@@ ows for the building of spiritual civilization in our region , and the pan@@ els are seen as if they are not only an issue of image , but also will have an impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a big and powerful tourism industry , you will use this kind of a m@@ ess tourism environment to welcome the guests from the south to the north . who will be willing to come and who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy obtain benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the north of the tian@@ nan prefecture . it should be said that the pressing task is to do so .
the operation of the small businesses and haw@@ kers should be regul@@ ated and their un@@ authorized operations should be resolutely eliminated . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only in a civilized and orderly environment can we make a happy life and go all out to bring prosperity to our country .

the dong@@ cheng district in beijing used electric sh@@ ots and other items as a measure to reward 12 households who volun@@ t@@ arily released their own insurance .
( beijing news , 10 july )
i am glad to see the improvement of the life of these families , but i am still l@@ uc@@ ky to give you an award on your own initiative , but i am very happy .
ji@@ ao@@ jie , deputy director of the ji@@ ao@@ jie district office , said : in view of such issues as che@@ ating on low - income insurance and encouraging voluntary retirement , it is a model for other low - income households .
this model is to encourage other low - level insur@@ ers to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , and if they want to use this to influence those who have been dec@@ ep@@ tive to che@@ ating on long - term low - level security , they are not n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up low - income households , more of them are law - based .
relevant departments should strengthen the performance of the obligations of low - income households in enjoying low - income insurance : if they promptly noti@@ fy the families and the changes in their income , report on employment conditions , and accept regular re@@ examination , the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the long - term plan of with@@ standing the fr@@ ay by law is a long - term plan .
the neighbor@@ hood has the responsibility to give them a green award , which is to be bur@@ ied ?
as a primary government organization , the spending on the street is borne by the financial appropri@@ ation .
the money of a tax@@ pay@@ er should not be used .
on the one hand , those who qu@@ it low - income families prove that they have a certain amount of self - sufficient ability to save themselves , and on the other hand , do they still exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , known as the relief money , should be given a disaster in the snow , not a br@@ oc@@ ade .

( yesterday 's xin@@ jing bao )
liu di@@ an@@ yi 's th@@ on@@ li@@ ps may be more than those appointed cadres who are on the alert , but they are more real and more pr@@ on@@ ounced than others .
the most significant portion of the public pre@@ jud@@ ice system in terms of appointment lies in the former being mainly decided by ordinary party members and masses of power , while the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the orientation of the sources of power determin@@ es that the former must give the people the first place in responsibility .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom they are responsible are the fundamental factors for determining how the elected person can carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned such democratic lo@@ ose and fr@@ agr@@ ant democratic like a hot game of democracy .
my view is that such a democratic and fr@@ ag@@ m@@ entary form is better than that .
considering the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grassroots level in china , i believe that direct elections are a major breakthrough , democracy is an important component of this kind , and it is not necessary to under@@ estimate the promotion of the building of grass - roots democracy .

p@@ ach@@ i is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
p@@ ach@@ i is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ at is from the opposition people 's party .
since the national congress party has an advantage in the presidential election , media and the people are likely to be elected one after another .
the 72 - year - old p@@ ach@@ i is the female governor of j@@ a@@ ep@@ han state .
she 's a lawyers , a popular son , has rich experience in the parliament , and she was accor@@ ded a warm welcome by the government when she was the governor of l@@ ag@@ a@@ j@@ as@@ one state .
she also worked for social welfare , which is the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural and sports organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ ai@@ ch@@ ai@@ ri@@ e became a candidate was that she had always been un@@ w@@ aver@@ ing in s@@ ony g@@ and@@ hi , chairman of the indian national congress party .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .

the number of reports that have triggered adverse re@@ actions from the chinese medicine council has increased by a large margin .
according to a report by the us media on 15 march , the number of adverse re@@ actions such as heart disease caused by anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es ther@@ ap@@ y has recently shown a dram@@ atic increase in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a security warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting that di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients should be treated with good reason because scientists published a research report in the first issue of " xin yan " magazine on 21 may , saying that this popular drug would greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence and inci@@ d@@ ence of heart disease among the patients .
wen di@@ yi 's el@@ eg@@ ant leg@@ s have received close attention from doctors and patients .
statistics show that , in about one month after the issue of safety warnings , the us drug administration received 3@@ 57 examples of adverse re@@ actions , of which 38 were fat@@ alities .
in january and february this year , the bureau received only 50 and 73 bad reaction reports .
these bad respon@@ ses were light to water bu@@ b@@ bles , with the emphasis on sudden death of heart disease .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration said that they are still too early to reach the in@@ secure conclusion of wen@@ di@@ ya .
the board will hold a hearing on wen@@ di 's yan kun on 30 july .
the 1999 str@@ ing of cul@@ inary di@@ all@@ a is a kind of pan@@ cre@@ as that can be used to treat di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
there are about 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients in the world who have taken or are taking chinese di@@ agn@@ os@@ is .

the ' 07 military uni@@ forms desig@@ ner ' is a guest of the chinese military .
on 13 july , the reporters of yang bao@@ jin and liu xin@@ xin reported that the entire army will soon replace the 07 - style uni@@ forms beginning 1 august .
this evening , the china military network specially invited chen jun , deputy director of the armament department of the chinese military , who was under the command of the ministry of military material , and su yang , a senior engine@@ er of the seventh type of military uni@@ form , to be a guest of the chinese military net , to the background of the birth of new military uni@@ forms with ne@@ tiz@@ ens both inside and outside the military , and to the process of research and development .
the two guests are the direct tig@@ er of the seventh military uni@@ form design .
speaking of changes in new uni@@ forms , they said that the 07 style uni@@ forms are specially designed in the name of yang yang yang , especially the 97 type of uni@@ forms , and the series of fr@@ agr@@ ant and fr@@ ig@@ id methods in military uni@@ forms and seven other aspects , totaling several hundred items .
the most important characteristic of the seventh type of uni@@ forms is that it reflects the requirements of the need to make the fr@@ oz@@ en function of our army , so that military uni@@ forms will reach for the first time the standard of coordination of the three armed services and the three armed services and coordination of the varie@@ ties of sun@@ light and fr@@ ig@@ ates , and this marks a historic leap in the level of building our army uni@@ forms .

jing@@ jiang city 's people 's armed forces platform to improve the quality of specialized cadres
cao jia@@ quan reporting from zhu chun@@ bin : on 18 june , a group of military cadres from jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , who were attending the ceremony , was given a lecture by lu yu@@ qing , armed forces minister of x@@ il@@ ai town , on " fighting a psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions , " which was unanimously favor@@ ed by the participating cad@@ ets .
this is the most important reason why the ministry of personnel and armed forces has effectively pressed and pressed cadres at specialized arms in light of their actual conditions in their posts and has striv@@ en to improve the comprehensive quality of the cadres of specialized arms .
early this year , when conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level , the party committee of the ministry of people 's armed forces found that some cadres with special military skills had been appointed chief and were not promoted to positions , and that they had not focused their main energy on the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they adopted the method of centralized training to rely on training in local party schools and other methods , regularly training specialized military cadres , and focusing on resolving the problems of having a narrow range of knowledge and having a single professional quality .
in light of the central work , we should boldly send cadres with special arms to them , and should train them on duty to improve their ability to work in posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for the appointment of specialized military cadres for appointment , " explicitly stipul@@ ating that the armed forces minister must enter the leading body of the party committee and stop sending others to other posts .
a mechanism for adjustment and exchange of cadres with specialized arms has been established for the cadres who are too old and who are not in line with the work of arming the grass - roots level to promptly adjust and exchange and to promote and use the cadres who are highly competent in comprehensive quality and ability .
chen y@@ is@@ ong , director of the armed forces department of the new century chu@@ an@@ ji armed company , led the militi@@ a technical unit to innovate and develop under@@ water ship technology , filled domestic ha@@ ils , and was upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
good will be the last to be good .
the results of the match alone are reasonable , and also the ones that can be accepted by others . the key is the process of competition , so many regre@@ ts .
if iran leads the iranian team by 2 - 0 and then the ri@@ f@@ le is the same for china , then it will definitely be different , and it will be very long - standing morale , which is the opposite of the situation .
ben@@ evol@@ ence cannot end well , and it can be said that it is a kind of old problem .
my life is often not playing a ball under the condition of the current situation , and the view of ordinary people is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a reason why we cannot be as good as a weak one .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that it is not perfect .
sun jin@@ hai 's xiang sun jia@@ xiang and zheng ji@@ ao 's di@@ an@@ chi and others played the ball in europe , but li wei - feng and others were also old men of the s@@ and field . they could see how broad they had seen , and said , based on reason , that psychological quality would not have any problem .
this was forced by iran 's team , and the reason is that the group was ready to move to the scene and send troops to the scene .
iran 's team , under backward conditions , changed two people and immediately got their chan@@ ces .
three men were also replaced in the second half of the ball , but the effect was not good .
to overcome the problems that can not be properly handled , we must accurately find the root cause of problems .
if problems are accurately identified and the methods for re@@ moving the problems are probably not difficult to find .
they are afraid of going to the hospital in a hur@@ ry .
if this goes on , then the fr@@ ay will be a match for more , and the old problems will be inv@@ aded , and it will not be possible to talk about a further match that everyone is looking forward to .

this newspaper 's reporter x@@ ue bing@@ jian and xu qing reporting : the educational organization of small , remote , and directly subordinate units , xiao@@ yuan , and directly under the direct command of the xiao@@ yuan , has little resources to fight on its own , and will become a historical event at a certain base of the second artillery corps .
this reporter recently learned that after six months of trial - point work , the base has issued " implementation measures for implementing the ' program for ideological and political education ' " to cover several ideological and political education coordination zones of all small , sc@@ attered , and directly subordinate units of the base .
