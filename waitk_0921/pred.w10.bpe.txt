beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the united states has decided to send a bill to congress a few days ago to review the defense of china , which is most likely to have a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is unreasonable accus@@ ation and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the military threat of china 's normal national defense construction and interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt to the report on 15 occasions directly mention the two foreign re@@ mit@@ tance of china or the li@@ qui@@ d term of china , saying that as a major and emerging power , china has the potential to compete with the united states in military affairs , and that china may very well develop , in the form of traditional weapons and thus destroy the us military superiority .
yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the us defense strategy report that china is the new@@ er power that most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly for the first time made russia 's sun@@ ni india as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china threat threat , a country with more attention .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the same bre@@ ath as the " four - year defense assessment report , " us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , including the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if the military action to be taken in iraq and afghanistan is added to the budget , the us defense budget for 2007 will break the $ 500 - billion mark , set a new record , z@@ ang ku@@ i - chi@@ en said , and the defense budget will be almost equivalent to the sum and expenditure of the military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said that the us fabr@@ icated the threat of other countries ' threats have reflected the consistent style of the pentagon that has created an enemy and has its real purpose in striving for more national defense funds and in order to ear@@ n more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
military experts who have participated in the white paper on china 's national defense , deng hong@@ zhou , said that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a decline .
official data show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's defense expenditures dropped nearly 10 percentage points in the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' total , and the per capita military spending was only about one - six@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the united states ' military spending , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area is generally similar to china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge , which is in the end who has exceeded the proper defense needs , and this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the white paper entitled " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been so far nor will it pose a threat to any country in the past or in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases abroad , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the institute of international relations of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , promote mutual understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet formation
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form new cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 21 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policy hamas will pursue will directly influence the next policy orientation of the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , the parties concerned in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of the cabinet that involve future developments .
which family is the prime minister 's post bl@@ o@@ oming ?
after hamas was formed , some people outside the country were worried that hamas ' prime minister 's current leader might have a difference with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has the power to control , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to pass tax on it .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting an independent person is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect the independent hamas chairman jam@@ ali al-@@ ah@@ mad@@ i , who is also chairman of the board of directors of islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that the most important thing is whether the prime minister 's position is to weak@@ en hamas 's strong color as far as possible , and only this can guarantee the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
in the meantime , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
palestinian daily said in a document that hamas has gathered in the public through social welfare projects but lacks experience in governing and has the experience of ruling the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governance .
hamas proposed to establish a political partnership with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly form a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
fat@@ ah has different opinions on whether to enter the cabinet , and the one faction advocates taking part in the new government , so as to accomplish something . the other faction is willing to do a positive opposition in the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain over the distribution of their cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework that is out of line with the party 's subordinate cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a qing - col@@ ou@@ red expert - type government , but it is not known whether it is a specific list .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technical expert - type government has also become a form of cabinet - forming to reli@@ eve external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council took office on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course will the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel are extremely tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect political participation by armed forces .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is the group 's strategic choice .
the armed forces issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas has been elected the largest party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom , and has made it the same old way as the ruling party in the government .
hamas has proposed to unify all factions into the armed forces of palestinian national authority , but has not received any extensive response , and has also been attacked by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( islamic ji@@ had ) .
at present , palestine has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah has some armed factions that have sl@@ ack@@ ened their organizational relations , such as the marty@@ r al-@@ mas@@ ak@@ i , the marty@@ r mas@@ ah@@ i , and others .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in power and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to safety management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police , civil defense , and other organizations , but are under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further document .

the cur@@ tain on the first set of american super fr@@ ost , the us super fr@@ ost , has become a hot match among american broadcasting players in gre@@ eting the era of the high qing dynasty .
according to a report in the financial times a few days ago , the us congress recently passed a bill , stipul@@ ating that the american broadcasting industry must stop its current simul@@ ated television signal on 17 february 200@@ 9 and only send digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the program of the us television program has already set a clear timetable .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the us consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets will exceed the traditional t@@ v@@ s this year , while 8@@ 5.@@ 0 percent of the digital tv sets will be high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
xinhua news agency , tokyo , february 13 ( reporter qian zheng ) research personnel of the east china sea university of japan developed a bi@@ os@@ af@@ ety - two - man kid@@ ney function , which is not only the same as human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of re@@ taining the useful components , and is also small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with the in - depth study , it is expected that the kid@@ ney patients will bring fu@@ sion .
according to a recent report by the " japan economic and trade news , " the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ne@@ ys are mainly composed of two parts , some of which are fil@@ tered from blood for ther@@ m@@ al j@@ ul@@ i@@ ar and di@@ ving , and others are used to re@@ visit their blood under the tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous tu@@ mors of the original m@@ am@@ mo@@ th di@@ ous di@@ a@@ quar@@ ium , am@@ ond ac@@ id , and other elements of the original ur@@ ine .
the man made a kid@@ ney , and the fr@@ ag@@ ile tu@@ be was made from the sil@@ k line in the middle air , and the people were filled with the inner side with the di@@ m - di@@ ving function of the de@@ hydr@@ ation .

south african envoy to china said that there is no such thing as a group of fi@@ res against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the south african embassy in china has been paying a state visit to china on the 13@@ th , minister of foreign affairs minister ban kang - ning said in an exclusive interview with xinhua on the 13@@ th that there is no such thing as an organized crime against chinese citizens in south africa .
he also said that the south african government will do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes to see a foreign - funded company in south africa secure their lives and property , said v@@ an@@ in .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side in this regard and reminded chinese nationals resi@@ ding in south africa to further enhance their sense of security and prevention , and chinese nationals resi@@ ding in south africa to strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
i would like to express our sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry over this and the chinese people also believe that the south african government is now earnestly investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully solved the murder of chen jian@@ qing , a fujian woman in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
the south african embassy in china also disclosed that south african police arrested the criminal suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year and the victims ' money and property have been recovered .
on the impact of the possible killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning maintained that these incidents indeed will have a negative impact on the trade fr@@ iction between the two countries and the exchanges in other areas , but from a long - term perspective , the impact should not be great enough .
according to the south african embassy tourism commissioner , the embassy has provided consul@@ ar service to more than 2,000 chinese people in south africa on the first 15 days of this year alone .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's position as the largest trading partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 - billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism circles believe that the continuous killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has had a clear impact on the number of chinese tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism administration , in the first half of 2005 , chinese tourists to south africa were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
at present , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , covering the cities and towns of south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor in south africa , the unemployment rate , and the flood of guns , and the death penalty is not de@@ ter@@ red , so the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they and their homes have cash , and they are eas@@ ier to become the targets of criminal elements ' pursuit of financial attacks .

the international winter season 's two alliance made a decision on the same day on imposing a two - year ban on the sec@@ a .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are found to have used stimul@@ ants at the olympic games , and that they will be eliminated and their qualifications for the competition will be depriv@@ ed , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ants by athletes is a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who def@@ y the law will face three months to three years of imprisonment .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining and he@@ at barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement after a one - year long barg@@ aining bid . the two sides agreed to handle the incident of using stimul@@ ants by the athletes in accordance with the law during the current winter olympic games .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympic games , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' place , but the medic@@ inal p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des would still be investigated by italian procuratorial organs .
according to reports , the italian government supervis@@ es the pu@@ dong os@@ o organization , pe@@ ter cam@@ pu@@ s , has already sent the d@@ os@@ si@@ er incident to the du@@ bl@@ in procuratorate .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter cam@@ pu@@ s have not yet confirmed this matter .
russian winter 2 team team team medical an dem@@ i@@ re@@ ov disclosed at noon on 17 july that the dispatch tu@@ a le@@ uk@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he has been a member of the chinese sports delegation who has been working in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agencies for many years . he said that once the le@@ uk@@ a is sent back to china , this matter may eventually be un@@ finished .
shi kang said the i@@ oc and the italian government have always exchanged views on the anti - stimul@@ ant problem of the winter olympics , and even if italian procuratorial agencies really interven@@ e in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous penalty of the stimul@@ ant incident against italian athletes , the most serious punishment imposed by the banned is just the two years of imprisonment and the bu@@ f@@ fer period .
therefore , senior italian correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending a le@@ uk@@ a to prison is so ab@@ rup@@ t , and the top one is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a ab@@ sent , it is impossible for the italian police to go abroad to take the same sentence .
if the japanese side ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not take her .
