according to reports , many insurance agencies share the same view .
experts said that since the renminbi market is still in no way , the insurance institutions are not suffici@@ ently capable of avoiding danger , and therefore the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long term , overseas investment should be in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb has a relatively great pressure of appreciation , china 's investment in foreign exchange will mainly be made use of its own foreign exchange funds .
in the current situation , it is necessary to treat the matter with cau@@ tion in the course of overseas investment .

chen secre@@ tly approv@@ es judicial intervention in election taiwan 's " judicial yuan " denied and asked for explan@@ ations .
in july , china news , taiwan judicial personnel questi@@ oned on 30 july the attempt of taiwan judicial personnel to get involved in the election of taiwan 's regional leaders .
the executive of the taiwan cour@@ ty@@ ard 's cour@@ ty@@ ard gao jin@@ zhi said on the same day that the current performance of judges on the island is not in keeping with chen shui - bian 's words , and he also asked chen shui - bian to explain his remarks .
according to a report by taiwan 's " king , " chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the prosecu@@ tors or investig@@ ators on 30 june . he interven@@ ed in a tem@@ pe@@ ation or even attempted to influence the election activities of various party candidates because of political or election considerations . he said that he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it may be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's doubts , the court president of the taiwan provincial capital , yu@@ e@@ ju yu@@ sheng , did not respond to him , and secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un spoke on behalf of the supreme court of justice .
gao jin@@ chi said : the basic law and the co@@ des of judges in taiwan should be declared as exceeding the party , not participating in party activities , and not supporting the election . judges are very cautious in observing relevant matters . the court of justice believes that judges are under the control of the cour@@ ty@@ ard of the state council are very good .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that the supreme court of kaohsiung was invited to attend the school course in k@@ ad@@ ena several years ago , because the courses are of political parties and the self - discipline committee of the judge is formed .
zhang sheng@@ xi wanted to attend the dpp for a time , but also decided to give up the matter because of his dispute over taking up the post .
gao jin@@ zhi said that if a case is tried , a court member should not be held responsible for the outcome of the judgment alone , he would not be able to tell the judge that there is no political intention .
germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel
the pla daily reported on july 1 to wang huai@@ cheng
the german education minister said a few days ago that germany should lower its " mag@@ ic " policy on the import of foreign professionals , and increase the import of foreign talent to resolve the problems of professional talent in germany through increasing the import of foreign professionals .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's labor force , from 15 to 64 , will decrease year on year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , then the labor force in germany will decrease by 6@@ percent over the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ er association have reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers are quite large in terms of professional technical personnel .
according to the statistics of the federal labor bureau of germany , the supply of some 1.@@ 27 million workers in the german labor market was about 17@@ 0,000 , and the number of technicians suppl@@ ied by technicians was about 9@@ 600 .
to protect its own people , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting foreign talent .
germany 's " ap@@ ple " stipulates that professional personnel from non - eu countries are not allowed to be in germany at a lower level than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot obtain employment and residence permits in germany .
sh@@ ay@@ man suggested that this limit be lowered to the over@@ stoc@@ king of the euro .
and do not have blind faith in laws .
the " law of lawyers " , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates in article 8 : those who have engaged in professional work such as legal research and teaching , and those who have a high level or professional level of professional work , who have applied for a solic@@ itor 's management , may be granted to lawyers for their professional work after the examination by the judicial administrative departments of the state council .
( china 's " ur@@ um@@ chi " on 28 june )
in law , there is a theoretical circle and a fac@@ ial se@@ g@@ ment of the subject , mainly including legal teaching and research work , and more of the latter engaged in legal proceedings , such as legal consultation , legal services , and so on .
for a long time , the law has been a subject of l@@ ac@@ kn@@ ess and fac@@ tual reality , and the theory circle believes that the need for the control of the vast land is only a mechanical person who is the subject of the control of the theory on the battle@@ fields , and the critical of the theoretical circle on the part of the national defense circles , which cannot be used as guidance for practice .
the law can do so in the face of such a division of labor , instead of giving support to any party .
however , the law of lawyers , which contains a summary of the law , has obj@@ ectively recognized that the legal system must be higher than the actual judgment of the legal profession .
in fact , some p@@ ure theoretical research and teaching experts and scholars engaged in research on the legal system , international law , and other theories are also very profound in their theory and in the legal sense .
in this way , the law is no doubt a conf@@ used public , and the conf@@ used qualifications of the legal profession , and it is extremely un@@ easy to have an impact on the state .
super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circle is still more than those , such as expert discussions and demonstrations , which will often affect or even rej@@ ect court judg@@ ments , and this is also the direct manif@@ estation of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers terror attack level
london , july 5 ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- ( reporter guo lin )
british government ho@@ ol@@ ig@@ ans lowered the terror attack level from the highest level to the serious level of dr@@ ag@@ ons , which indicated that the terrorist attacks in britain will not happen soon , but the attacks are still extremely likely .
at present , the british police have transferred the investigation to india and australia .
because of the arrest of eight suspects of terrorist attacks , the government will carry out a thorough investigation into the background of the migr@@ ants entering the medical system .
it is reported that some of the people who have worked in britain 's public health system are receiving medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also demanded that an investigation be conducted against the background of high - tech immigration , and that employers or relevant organizations be required to provide background information .
let 's take a hu@@ e .
the tourist guide , the ta@@ p is the lo@@ ose and self - sufficient , and the greatest enjo@@ yment of the fruits of natural and social civilization .
but many people went to the country to meet with this kind of an@@ no@@ ying , and were arrested by traders and intermedi@@ ary business .
both cars and tr@@ ains , when they were in the air , they would always be subject to the death of a small business@@ man and some unlicensed intermedi@@ aries .
it was not selling fl@@ ow@@ ery spr@@ aw@@ ns , that is , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then giving us a free introduction of food be@@ ver@@ ages , even a false statement of documents .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is very un@@ successful that it will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some cases , many people have the same feelings .
if you have not entered the gate , some people will visit the wh@@ ar@@ f and make a little o@@ y@@ sters .
after entering the door , this situation became even more serious . no matter how good it was , it was also so much so much so that it was too d@@ read@@ ful to sm@@ ell .
according to reports by the media , many foreign tourists who went to xian did not give up their pra@@ ise for xi@@ '@@ an , but they were not afraid of the sale of those small business haw@@ kers that had been re@@ possess@@ ed .
these include the station 's gr@@ en@@ ades , which are originally the place of the bank and the fl@@ ag@@ ging , should be civilized , orderly , and harmonious , and should give a broad - minded environment .
the freedom of the traders , the un@@ cle , the ca@@ rel@@ ess@@ ness , and the objective destruction of these public order , the formation of a pl@@ ut@@ ation and environmental pollution , and the provision of the conditions and opportunities for the release of the ho@@ stages .
it is important that these g@@ aps are the window for the building of spiritual civilization in the loc@@ ality , and the problems they are doing are not only the issue of image , but will also have an impact on the development of the local economy .
just think , you should be a big tourist industry , but you use this kind of chao@@ tic and bad tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests coming from the south . who is willing to come ?
how do your tourist economy obtain benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak season , a civilized and tourist environment has been created for tourists from the north and the south of tian@@ shan .
the amount of money is not the market , the operation of small business haw@@ kers should be regul@@ ated , and un@@ veri@@ fied operations should be resolutely abol@@ ished . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked .
only a civilized and orderly environment can we be happy and re@@ ple@@ te with happiness and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ing .
one sentence , let traders go so imp@@ ati@@ ent .
he gave the award on his own initiative .
beijing dong@@ cheng district has issued electric materials and other materials to the 12 households for the low - security families who volun@@ t@@ arily surr@@ ender .
( " xin jing bao " 10 july " )
this writ@@ er is happy to see the improvement of the lives of these families , but the wor@@ ding of returning to the emb@@ odi@@ ment of the original state on his own initiative is also complicated .
ji@@ u@@ qi street 's deputy director said that , in view of such problems as low - income earn@@ ers , encouraging the peasants to volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ treat was an example for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income security personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this opportunity , those who have long been dece@@ ived and in@@ sured , they are not sure that they are inf@@ ant .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing away the minimum guarantee , it is legal to rely more on it .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of the rights of the minimum guarantee households to fulfill their obligations when enjoying the minimum guarantee : if they promptly report on changes in family personnel and income , report on employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination , relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term measure to release money according to law .
the street has given awards to families who have returned the money .
the streets are the organizations of the government , and their expenditures are borne by the appropri@@ ation of funds .
the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be used .
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - guarantee families prov@@ es that they have the ability to make their own decisions and to set limits on their own , and on the other hand , are those who apply for minimum guarantees still exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called a financial aid for life , should be called a c@@ ann@@ on for the sake of providing relief to the public , not a mag@@ ic for the public .
liu said that he was willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first native of zhao@@ xin , the first town in the country to elect n@@ ag@@ o@@ ya n@@ un@@ ag@@ ang , liu tu@@ an@@ yi , accepted democracy for the fourth time after assuming office , with a total satisfaction of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the dialogue between the reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu ti@@ en - yi defined himself as a person who works as a super@@ serv@@ ant .
( beijing news yesterday )
liu ti@@ e@@ yi 's sur@@ g@@ ical service may be more popular than some appointed cadres .
compared with the most popular vote system , the former is mainly composed of ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher authorities , while the source of power determin@@ es that the former must place the people in the first place .
the source of power and responsibility to the person are the fundamental factors that determine the outcome of the election .
some people questi@@ oned such democracy , and even a democratic show .
my view is that with such a democratic form , it is better to have it .
in consideration of the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grassroots level in china , i believe that direct elections for the public are already a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component part of the effort to promote the building of democracy at the grassroots level .
india hopes to select first female president analysts , saying that it is quite likely that the election will be held , and female voters hope to raise their status as women

p@@ ag@@ er is a candidate for the ruling congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ k@@ a@@ er is from the opposition people 's party .
because the congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the public are thr@@ own in , and the possibility of being elected is quite great .
p@@ ag@@ u@@ ang , 72 , is a female ser@@ ge@@ ant of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she was a law@@ yer , she was admitted to the congress , and was rich in experience . while she was the governor of ra@@ j@@ a , she was accor@@ ded a government official 's honor .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a great hon@@ our of many cultural education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ ach@@ ach@@ i became a candidate was because she unswervingly sum@@ mon@@ ed indian congress party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has been controlling the ruling national congress party for a long time .
p@@ ag@@ er was emb@@ rac@@ ed by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believe p@@ ag@@ er will be dis@@ crimin@@ ating against the indian women 's bad@@ ly - educated women and raise their status .
the constitution stipulates that india is a state under the federal system , and the president is the head of state and the commander of the state , and does not represent any party organization , but more is a symb@@ ol .

di@@ a@@ bet@@ es di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , a report that causes bad re@@ actions , increases sharply
according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the number of bad re@@ actions , such as heart diseases caused by anti@@ di@@ a@@ bet@@ es and el@@ eg@@ ant , has recently been on a substantial increase in the united states .
the food and drug administration in the united states issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting that di@@ a@@ bet@@ es be used in comp@@ act dis@@ til@@ l@@ ation because the scientists published a research report on the new medicine published on 21 may , which said that this type of medicine would greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of heart disease and he@@ in@@ ous ch@@ ol@@ era of patients .
as a result , the doctor and patient 's attention was closely watched .
statistics show that about one month after the issue of the safety warning , the us drug administration received 3@@ 57 cases of in@@ appropriate response , 38 of which were reports of death .
in january and february this year , the drug administration received only 50 and 73 und@@ es@@ ir@@ able reports .

three major functions of modern military service
first , the identification function .
different countries ' armed forces , armed forces , and people 's armed forces are different in nature .
in more than 100 countries of the world , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , no military uni@@ forms of any two countries are completely the same .
second , the symbol@@ ic function .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are the reflection of the spiritual features of a country and are also the subject of the ability of a nation 's army to fight a battle .
in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the three major military uni@@ forms of the training uni@@ forms are most capable of showing the military 's prestige , the g@@ est@@ ures of the military uni@@ forms are filled with a be@@ au@@ ty .
third , the function of protection .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons and equipment , the comprehensive protection capability of new - type operational uni@@ forms has enabled the uni@@ forms to have anti - chemical warfare , anti - radi@@ ation , and dr@@ opping dr@@ ops of mo@@ ist and th@@ um@@ b air , and so on , and have become the most important issue in the development of military uni@@ form .

qu me@@ i@@ chu reported that we can live on the house and benefit from the big team party committee 's determination and courage to clear the house .
today , more than 10 military officers and men of a certain communications training unit of the chengdu military region are all very happy about the problem of the party committee of the large group being br@@ ave enough to solve the problem . they are full of respect and jo@@ y and p@@ ure .
in the past few years , with the personnel 's release , some of the houses of the family branch of this group were occupied in violation of regulations , causing the cadres in service to have a difficult housing problem and the officers and soldiers have quite a lot of complaints about this .
the group also cle@@ ared several housing times , and it was not clear because of various obstruc@@ tions , making this problem a difficult problem .
if you have to dare to compar@@ e your word with your mou@@ th@@ ful , you will have no difficult problems that cannot be solved .
after the new party committee reached a consensus , the principal leaders personally set to thoroughly sort out all violations of rules and regulations concerning the occupation of houses .
on the one hand , they were over@@ bearing and were arrog@@ ant , and hoped that the personnel concerned would explain the policies and regulations of the armed forces ' barr@@ ack and fund - raising houses and the economy 's application of housing , indicating the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand .
for those who have housing in other places , who do not want to re@@ treat from the over@@ ly occupied housing , party committees and organs promptly cont@@ acted their units and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to take the initiative to coordinate with the work of the troops .
after two months of meticulous work , all those households who illegally occupy houses were moved out on schedule , and the on - the - job cadres of the brigade were assigned to their houses according to regulations .
the party committee of the group had the courage to face tough tests , and it also produced a tem@@ pt@@ ation effect . a few cadres who originally did not want to actively cooperate with the organization 's distribution have now expressed their subordin@@ ation to the decision of the organization .

the seven - style military uni@@ form design@@ ers as guest of the chinese web
the pla daily , beijing , 13 july ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- report by yang bao@@ jin and liu xin@@ xin : the pla units will be changed to a military uni@@ form of seven - year arms on 1 august .
tonight , the chinese military website specially invited the military supplies bureau deputy director chen jun and the military needed equipment research institute 's senior engine@@ er , qi yu@@ e@@ yang , to be a guest of the chinese military web , and to exchange with ne@@ tiz@@ ens from inside and outside the military and the research and development process of the new military uni@@ forms , which have aroused respon@@ ses from ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the direct fl@@ ag@@ ons of the seven - style military uni@@ form design .
speaking about the changes in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the 7 - style military uni@@ form was changed in the order of the 97 - type military uni@@ form , and the series of dr@@ ag@@ ons in the military uni@@ form and other seven improvements were as many as several hundred .
the most prominent characteristic of the 07 military uni@@ form is that it embodies the requirements of making our military uni@@ forms more transparent , and that our military uni@@ forms can reach the standards of coordinating the three armed services for the first time , indicating that the level of our army 's military uni@@ form construction has achieved a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the str@@ ains of new military uni@@ forms , including the cr@@ ane pl@@ um@@ es of the br@@ on@@ ze pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium , and other issues with website visitors .
this time , the chinese military web site and the new chinese website are jointly held .
the jin@@ jiang city personnel training platform has enhanced the quality of specialized cadres .
the pla daily reports from cao jia@@ ju and zhu chun@@ bin : on 18 june , a group of cadres from jing@@ jiang city in jiangsu province was held in the bin@@ ding hall of the cadres of the armed forces of x@@ il@@ ai town . lu yu@@ qing , director of the armed police department of xi@@ cheng town , gave lectures on " fighting and winning a psychological war under the condition of informatization . " the lecture was unanimously held by the train@@ ees .
this is the first time that the military department has put pressure on the cadres of the special forces unit in light of the actual conditions of their posts , and has devoted great efforts to raising the comprehensive quality of specialized military cadres .
early this year , when conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered that some cadres with special weapons had been appointed , and they were not placed in the armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of training through training in a centralized manner , relying on local party schools to train specialized military cadres at regular inter@@ vals , and focused on solving problems such as the un@@ it@@ ary quality of specialized military cadres .
in light of the central task , boldly as@@ sign special - duty cadres to them , and through their work posts , enhance their ability to perform duties .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " plan for appointing specialized military cadres for posts " and explicitly stipulated that the ministers of the armed forces must be in the leading body and not be removed from their posts .
and established a mechanism for specialized - arms cadres to adjust and exchange , and for some cadres of specialized military skills who are not adap@@ ted to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level , they promptly read@@ justed and exchanged their work and were promoted and used to comrades who are full of overall quality and strong working ability .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of xin@@ xin war@@ ship company , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water vessels to fill the domestic gap and was upgraded to the director of the armed forces department of the company .
first , good will be good .
the results of the match are only a rational score of 2 - 2 , and can be accepted by the subject , and the key is the course of the competition , and how much regre@@ ts it will be .
if iran leads the 2 - 0 , then equ@@ als the score for china , then it will certainly be different , and it will be very long , the situation is quite different .
good will never end , but one old problem can be said to be a p@@ aw@@ n .
the situation is often a situation of un@@ rest , and the general view is china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a very reason why you cannot get on with your gr@@ ace .
however , judging from the competition today , it seems that it was not .
sun j@@ ig@@ ong , sun jia@@ xiang , zheng zhi , and others did not say anything about the ball in europe . li wei and others were also old players who had been s@@ and - dr@@ ag@@ ging . they were able to see the broad masses and say that their psychological quality would not have any problem .
this time , the iranian team was forced to calm , and the reason was probably that the troops would be deployed to the scene .
under backward conditions , iran 's team changed two and the scene immediately got the command .
the second half of the game also changed the three names , but the results were not good .
we must overcome the short@@ com@@ ings of being in@@ capable of ending problems , and we must find the root causes of problems .
as long as problems are accurately identified and the methods for changing problems are not difficult to find .
fear that they would be dr@@ ag@@ ged into a hospital for emergency treatment .
if this continues , the sti@@ r@@ ring up will be a competition that will be held back more , and the old def@@ ect will still be defeated . it will not be possible to play a further game that everybody is looking forward to .
