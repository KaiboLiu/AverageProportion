mr ko@@ o considered that the biggest revenue from part - time duties was to keep your knowledge updated and have the opportunity to involve another field . of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had some degree of attr@@ action .
as some hours of employment are low , the form of work is flexible and free , and it is gradually favor@@ ed by many graduates who are currently seeking employment , and 14@@ 0 percent of the h@@ our@@ ly jobs are graduates of tertiary institutions and secondary schools in the past three years .
i did n't want to work for an hour at the beginning , but after i did it for a few months , i felt it was better than the 9 th evening of 5 june , as i was working for a job .
after gradu@@ ating from college , university student xiao huang did not work as much as he expected . finally , he hung the name at a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am very satisfied with my current work , with an hour and 100 yuan , and with the environment , what i want to do now is to find more hours of work and make a living .
it is learned that hours of work has become a model for some graduates who are currently seeking jobs to accumul@@ ate experience in their work , and their skills are improving , and their skills are increasing .
the main focus of the graduates ' h@@ our@@ ly work is on the posts of a knowledge - based and relatively skilled - style , such as trans@@ lat@@ ors and performing arts posts with a strong e@@ po@@ ch , with a share of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % .
some of the jobs are not high , such as food promotion and marketing agents , and so on , and unemployed personnel can work on a job after simple training .
statistics show that among the workers , 3@@ 9@@ ,000 percent of the unemployed were employed , of which the proportion of the unemployed in the retail sector was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent of the cat@@ ering and cat@@ ering sector , and an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

prc expert : us accus@@ ation of military threat from china
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the united states has recently submitted a report to congress on the " four - year defense review " to the pentagon , calling china the most likely military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation of china 's normal national defense building , and the emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing of china 's military threat is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound china 's military strength and the corresponding measures that the united states should take to 15 times directly mention the two phr@@ ases of china , or china , which are china 's hot and hot , and says that as a major and emerging big country , china has the potential to conduct military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have counter@@ measure , china will very likely develop bad - handed weapons in the united states
yao yun@@ zhu , a resear@@ cher at the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its defense strategy report that china is a rising power that most likely to pose military challenges to the united states .
the report clearly for the first time made russia 's + indian + as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called ' china threat military threat ' that has given more attention to the issue .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences ,
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the same day the " four - year defense assessment report " was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted to congress a government budget for fiscal 2007 , of which the defense budget for national defense is $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the additional military action in iraq and afghanistan , the national defense budget for 2007 will break through the $ 500 - billion mark , setting a new historical record , pan@@ ku@@ ang said , and this is almost the same as the total military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us tr@@ ick of creating threats from other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon that cre@@ ates enemies . its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to gain more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in many times in the chinese national defense white paper , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditure in the same period has been on the decline .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending dropped by nearly 10 percentage points from the state 's fiscal expenditures for the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' total , and the per - capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - six@@ ty of the united states , and the per - capita military spending of the servicemen is about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the area of china 's territory and the area of china 's territory of the united states , which is r@@ oughly the same , is such a huge difference in military spending . it goes without saying that whoever 's military strength exceeds the normal defense needs .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of china 's arms control and disarmament association , said : the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction . china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become milit@@ arily oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper on china 's national defense in 2004 says that china will firmly follow the path of peaceful development and implement a defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and present no longer have a chance to pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
zhu feng , professor of the beijing university international relations college , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas seeks new cabinet , seeks breakthrough
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , wang yu@@ em@@ in , huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , and how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policies hamas will pursue will directly influence the direction of the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations and making preparations for the formation of a cabinet involving difficulties and sensitive points in the future development of the situation .
which family is the prime minister 's post bl@@ os@@ s@@ om ?
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people outside the world worried that prime minister hamas might have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel clearly stated that they would not accept a hamas government that holds the power of actual power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to pass tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a de@@ tr@@ im@@ ental policy to select an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest amount of international recognition , the leaders of both home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to choose an independent palestinian leader j@@ ah@@ ar - ab@@ d@@ ul@@ lah ah@@ mad al-@@ hu@@ ad@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of q@@ at@@ ar , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that the most important thing for the prime minister to be elected is that the prime minister should be as much as possible to play down the tough gu@@ ise of hamas , and only in this way can he guarantee the success of forming a cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing the formation of a hamas cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily said in an analysis that hamas has gathered human strength through social welfare projects , but lacks experience in governing and share the experience with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the ruling experience .
hamas proposed to establish a political partner with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly set up a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah now has different opinions on whether to enter the cabinet or not , and one faction advocates participating in the new government and doing something in this regard ; the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas and is willing to do active opposition in the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that with ab@@ b@@ as ' advice , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will barg@@ ain on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee framework that dis@@ regards the party - to - party cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a qing - col@@ ou@@ red expert - type government , but the specific list is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technological expert - type government has also lost no time in forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative yuan takes office on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude and are firmly demanding that hamas abandon violence and refuse to use force to participate in government .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 may that armed resistance is the strategic option of the organization .
the armed issue in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas was elected the first largest party in the legislative yuan through democracy and freedom , with the result that its subordinate armed factions , such as q@@ am@@ ang@@ l@@ ang brig@@ ades , were leg@@ alized as a means of bringing them into the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed to unify all factions into the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad respon@@ ses from the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ad ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that have lo@@ os@@ ened organizational relations , such as the marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades of ak@@ sa marty@@ rs , the sun@@ fl@@ ames of fat@@ ah , and so on .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are all in their own hands and distribu@@ te the right to ensure security .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police , and civil defense organizations , while the interior ministry of the new government is under the charge of the administration .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no documents have been made .

in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee , and won the right to speak and decision on international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 years , china 's extreme geograph@@ y has never been ready , has constantly developed , has initially been sc@@ attered , and has formed a three - station - a sun@@ sun@@ sun@@ ken north ; that is , the nan@@ polar chang@@ cheng station established in february 198@@ 5 , the ant@@ arc@@ tic zhong@@ shan station established in february 1989 , the arc@@ tic north pol@@ e station established in july 2004 , and the s@@ now@@ y pan north expedi@@ tion mission in the north

he said .

t@@ v@@ b becomes mainstream in us
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the number of high resolution digital television sets ( sun@@ ni ) , which are on the decline , has been increasing , with the sales of high - resolution tv sets ( li@@ ku@@ d ) and the market continuously expanding . the american television transmission agency has also stepped up its efforts to introduce corresponding high - definition television programs .
the newly - formed american super - pow@@ ered ol@@ ive soccer tour@@ na@@ ment has become a hot - spot match for american broadcast workers to gre@@ et the era of the high - tech television .
according to a report by the financial times a few days ago , the us congress recently passed a bill , stipul@@ ating that american broadcast workers must stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and they can only broadcast digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the american television program has already set a clear timetable .
the popul@@ arization of high - resolution digital television depends on consumers to purchase television sets , while on the one hand , it depends on the production organizations to provide high - definition digital programs .
although digital television has been repeatedly mentioned in the past few years , it has never become a reality .
this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the american consumer electronics association , the number - t@@ v@@ s sales volume in the united states this year will exceed the traditional t@@ v@@ s for the first time , and 8@@ 5.@@ 5 percent of the digital television sets are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) researchers of the japanese east china university ( t@@ ung@@ hai ) developed a bi@@ o - human kid@@ ney , not only with the function of di@@ vi@@ ding the same as human kid@@ ney , but also with the function of maintaining the functional ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents of sub@@ stances , and it is also easy to trans@@ plant , and with in - depth research , it is expected to bring back to kid@@ ney patients .
according to a recent report by " ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news , " the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ne@@ ys are mainly made up of two parts . some people who have fil@@ tered xie waste and water from blood are using water to make kid@@ ne@@ ys . the other part is the bab@@ y tu@@ bes who have been re@@ used to return to their blood from the original m@@ ud@@ dy water di@@ ame@@ ter and the p@@ am@@ in@@ o ac@@ e@@ th ac@@ id .
the people made a kid@@ ney , a fr@@ oz@@ en person , and the th@@ in tu@@ su@@ ite of the li@@ qui@@ d , all made from the sil@@ k line of the middle sky , and the interior side of the fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ agr@@ ant fr@@ ames were also filled with the car@@ di@@ ac - sk@@ in tu@@ bes with the functions of di@@ vi@@ ding waste separation .
this type of sk@@ in cell@@ s can make the blood that has been exposed many times , the disease that has caused it , cross , and di@@ agn@@ os@@ es , the vari@@ able hy@@ per@@ tension , which is divided into am@@ in@@ o ac@@ in@@ ac@@ et@@ am@@ ine ac@@ id and returned to blood , while at the same time can make the gl@@ uc@@ ose , body , vi@@ vi@@ vi@@ d , and mineral sub@@ stances re - enter the blood .
the previous human kid@@ ney reli@@ ed on the com@@ pres@@ sive sub@@ stances to fil@@ ter the waste , which could not be completely eliminated , and it was not equipped to re@@ act the components of the in@@ am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id to the blood .
researchers used the she@@ ep to carry out biological trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , and the use of the p@@ ig@@ s in the c@@ lif@@ fs in the w@@ alls of the c@@ lif@@ fs of human kid@@ ney was used by the pi@@ g 's sk@@ in cell@@ s .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human be@@ ings of kid@@ ney can be used .

these challenges include regional cy@@ cl@@ ical cy@@ lin@@ dr@@ ical supply and short - term electricity supply , the situation of electricity demand in some areas remain rather tight , and the fact that the ben@@ ign mechanism for electricity prices has not yet been formed has led to the problem of power supply , and at the same time , the problem of the dec@@ lining quality of electric power plants has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , the weak power gr@@ i@@ ds

he also said that the south african government will spare no effort in cracking down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to reduce crime rates to zero , and hopes to see every foreign - working overseas living and property safe in south africa be fully protected by local laws and citizens , he said .

analysts here believe that south africa is faced with a wide gap between rich and poor , a high unemployment rate , and a rampant gun supply , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death penalty , so the crime rate is high .
many chinese do not understand english , and cash exist with their bodies , and this is more pr@@ one to become the targets of criminal elements ' attempts to seek financial attacks .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : the incident of sending children may be un@@ clear .
du@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the incident of hir@@ a is likely to be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 12 , by reporter peng gao
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , it is still a matter of time that athletes who were discovered during the tur@@ in winter olympic games may face the suf@@ fer@@ ings of j@@ og@@ ging pow@@ der during their ten@@ ter@@ ies , judging from various circumstances , such a situation is not very likely to occur in the main character of the first d@@ ax@@ is scand@@ al in this winter olympics .
the capital city winter olympics , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the city , was exposed on 16 june . o@@ . par@@ a was found to have used banned drugs and cards .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the group of le@@ av@@ ers had been sent out of the winter olympics . the two women 's fif@@ teen - kilome@@ ter silver med@@ als for the first two women 's and 15 kilometers of the winter olympics that she obtained at this winter olympics have also been taken away .
the international winter season 's two alliance made a decision on the same day on the same day to impose a two - year penalty on the group of mal@@ v@@ in@@ as .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games , and they will be eliminated and depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the competition , but not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who try to def@@ y the law are also under the cust@@ o@@ dy of three to three years .
last december , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , the international olympic committee and the italian government finally reached an agreement after a one - year - long hot price . the two sides agreed to handle the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants according to italian law during the current winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympic games , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' place . however , the scre@@ ened - in athletes who are of a positive nature will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organ .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the pu@@ dong winter olympic games , per@@ si@@ an , has handed over the d@@ oping incident to the du@@ ling procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter cam@@ pu@@ s have not yet confirmed the case .
russian winter second team team te@@ amm@@ ate an@@ th@@ ony dem@@ i@@ y@@ ov disclosed at noon on 17 july that the ser@@ f left du@@ bl@@ in and returned to china .
he has been a member of the chinese sports official who has worked in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and said that once he returns to china , this incident may eventually be un@@ worthy of the guard .
shi kang - cheng said : the international olympic committee and the italian government have never thoroughly resolved the issue of anti - stimul@@ ant at the winter olympics games . even italian procuratorial organs ' earnest involvement in the incident , the result is still hard to say .
according to the previous verdic@@ t on the use of stimul@@ ants by italian athletes , the most serious punishment that the offenders received is only the two - year imprisonment of the bu@@ f@@ fer period .
therefore , italian an@@ th@@ ony le@@ i@@ re@@ i , a senior journalist in italy , said that the possibility of sending le@@ f@@ tist to prison is extremely remote , and most of the top is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a trial of its abs@@ ence , italian police could not go abroad to take the pl@@ as@@ a back to serve their sentence .
if the italian side ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , it will not be possible for them to take her .
