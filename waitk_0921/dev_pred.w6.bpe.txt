prc expert : us pre@@ ach@@ ing military threat to china un@@ justi@@ fi@@ able accus@@ ation
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to support the u.s. congress in its bid to raise its defense budget for the first time , according to a report on the four - year defense assessment , which was officially submitted to congress on february 9 .
experts believe that this is a ground@@ less accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense building , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the china military threat theory , and interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " report on the evaluation of defense affairs for the four years " is a new defense guiding document of the pentagon .
this 92 - page report used three sections to explain china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt , and the report directly mentioned the military power of china or the m@@ ir of china , which directly served as a major and emerging country , and said that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential for conducting military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop its military superiority , thus breaking the traditional us military
the chinese academy of military sciences ' world military research department resear@@ cher yao yun@@ zhu said : although senior us officials had expressed similar views many times before , this was the first time that the united states proposed in its arm@@ en@@ ian strategic report that china is one of the emerging powers that may most possibly pose a military challenge to the united states .
for the first time , the report clearly regards russia as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called " china threat theory " , as a new strategic oppon@@ ent .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the same day , us president bush also submitted a report on the 2007 fiscal year 's government budget , including the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9 - billion .
if the united states wants to carry out military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' fabr@@ ication of the theory of another country reflects the consistent style of the pentagon to create an enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds and to draw more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry .
experts said that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has attended many times the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the overall proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown a dec@@ lining trend .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over 50 percent of the national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the us , and the per capita military spending of the us was only about one - sixth of the us , and the per capita military spending of the military was about one - thir@@ ds of the us military spending .
the size of the united states and the territory of china are r@@ oughly equal , but the difference in military spending is so big . who is the military force that goes beyond the proper defense needs , and this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , director teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ad@@ vers@@ aries in the future .
the " china 's national defense in 2004 " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been able to make any threat to any country in the past or now .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the beijing university international relations college said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century in a joint effort to promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthroughs
ram@@ m@@ al an@@ a , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , sept . 23 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , and how to s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of attention in the international community at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue will directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process and the next step of the policy orientation of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the resistance of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet involving the difficulties and sensitive points in future development .
the prime minister 's post will bl@@ o@@ om and who will be ?
after hamas won the right to form the cabinet , some people in the outside worried that the current top leader of hamas might have differences with ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leaders , who are currently visiting egypt , have stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also intensified international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government , which is in charge of actual power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and hand over taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the candidate for independence is a compromise policy .
it has been reported that in order to obtain the international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who had gathered in egypt recently decided to elect the president of the islamic university of egypt j@@ a@@ '@@ al@@ em@@ ar al@@ e@@ k@@ ar al-@@ j@@ ab@@ er al-@@ ha@@ h@@ ad@@ i as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the prime minister 's position is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try as much as possible to less@@ en the hard - lin@@ er color of hamas , and only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of the cabinet .
how should power distribution be distributed ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge confron@@ ting hamas in forming its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian " al-@@ j@@ az@@ ir@@ ah " carried an analysis saying that hamas has ass@@ em@@ bled people through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and has a profound relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governing .
hamas proposed a package of diplomatic relations with fat@@ ah after the election to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are still many opinions on whether to enter the cabinet . one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus doing some things , while the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation , is willing to make active efforts in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to establish a framework of legislative council to dis@@ solve the party 's cabinet .
it has been reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel ' attitude , the technology expert - type government is also not necessarily a form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative yuan will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form the cabinet after it takes office on 16 february . the work of forming the cabinet will be completed within three weeks and five weeks .
how can the armed forces go ?
the weapons in hamas are another major thor@@ ny issue confron@@ ting the formation of the new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the strategic choice of the organization .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of armed forces .
hamas 's election through democracy and freedom was won by the international community by the first major party of the legisl@@ ature , and the armed factions under it were li@@ ke@@ wise leg@@ alized to bring them into the government security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all the factions into palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it did not receive a broad response , and it was also met with criticism by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( ji@@ had ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some other subordinate armed factions that have lo@@ os@@ ened their organizational relations , such as the ak@@ ach@@ a marty@@ r brig@@ ad@@ ier general ju@@ ju , etc.
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold negotiations with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are of their own accord , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the security and management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations , and the interior ministry of the new government will be under the control of the interior ministry .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no next item .

currently , we are working on the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and is also the first inland observation station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of effort , china 's polar exploration cause has been very important in the world 's extreme observation , but it is very much better to do with other major polar countries , and we must catch up with them .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui revealed that china will publish an annual report on the polar survey .

china 's power industry still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power regulatory commission ( s@@ ic ) said on the 13@@ th that although the power safety production in 2005 remained stable overall , the production safety of electricity still faced severe challenges .
vice chairman of the state electric power regulatory commission shi yu@@ bo said at the fifth national meeting of the state electric power safety production commission ( n@@ dr@@ c ) held here that china 's electricity safety production in 2005 was generally stable , and successfully fulfilled the power supply task to meet the summer peak , thus achieving power supply , actively responding to natural disasters , and basically ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system , and the production of power safety equipment and general electric power network accidents , significantly reducing and improving
however , he pointed out that as the power supply and demand situation changes and the large number of new power generating units are operating one after another , the power safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include regional hor@@ se - loss , which will still exist , and power supply and demand in some areas will remain on the high side , and the good power - supply mechanism has not yet taken shape , leading to a relatively big problem in coal supply , and the problem of a drop in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of some power generating units , on the weak structure of some power networks , and on the safety of the old equipment
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be continually exposed , and how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem confron@@ ting us .
in view of the 2006 power safety production work , shi yu@@ bo said : we should further consolidate the basic work of power safety production management , speed up the establishment and improvement of the power safety emergency management mechanism , improve the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation between the power plant network , and jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job of supervising and managing the safety of the dam , and ensure the safety of power stations , strengthen the management of power
it has been learned that in light of the new situation in power security management , the state electric power regulatory commission will revise and improve the " interim regulations on investigating electric power production accidents " that have been promulgated this year . meanwhile , the supplementary documents on the safety of the dam and the second - stage system of power stations will be issued this year to implement the regulations one after another .
in 2005 , china 's electricity consumption in society reached 2,@@ 4@@ 6@@ 8.@@ 9 billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ ts , an increase of 13.@@ 4@@ 55 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the still tight supply and demand situation in power supply and demand , and the conspicuous contradictions in coal , electricity , oil , and transportation , all power enterprises have taken effective measures to strengthen the management of equipment . last year , there was no extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious incident in power production throughout the country .
the power gr@@ id has caused 74 accidents , a year - on - year decrease of 1@@ 27 , and 4@@ 27 accidents involving equipment , a year - on - year decrease of 13@@ 2 cases .
south african envoy to china says no such thing as the organization of pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ or@@ ial organizations against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to work with the south african government to promote the development of the south african country , said a senior official here wednesday .
he also said that the south african government will do its best to crack down on all criminal activities in the form of crime .
he said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every one of the foreigners working in south africa will be punished by local law and the local citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been detained in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed broad concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further strengthen their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friend@@ liness among them , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
let 's express our sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the family of the victims .
fu k@@ an@@ ning said : " i am very sor@@ ry for this and i also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is earnestly investigating every case involving china . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing killing on 5 february in south africa , and a suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspect who was suspected of shooting hong kong business@@ man in january was arrested by the south african police and the victim 's property was recovered .
on the possibility of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed have a great impact on the trade of origin and other fields between the two countries .
according to the south african embassy tourism commissioner , n@@ ab@@ il n@@ ak@@ i@@ h@@ iro , the embassy paid more than 2,000 chinese vis@@ as to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa will continue to maintain its largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 3 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism circles believe that the successive incidents of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 2004 had a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
chinese living in south africa at present are around 200,000 , and the town and village of south africa are located .
analysts here believe that the gap between south africa and the rich and poor , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of guns have not been seen as a deterr@@ ent , and the crime rate is still high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and homes , and this is more likely to become the targets of criminal elements ' financial attacks .

china to curb coal mine accidents beijing , aug@@ . 16
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) four major traffic accidents have occurred one after another in beijing , with more than 100 people killed and more than 100 others injured , causing the production of the " three major " coal p@@ its , which have been production in the whole country in the past year , to become the top priority of the national security supervision work this year .
the reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 july that to curb the frequent occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents , including coal mines , the coal mine is the most important task .
this year , the state administration of safety supervision and administration of safety will do a good job in the following three aspects :
+ ju + continued to fight a battle of w@@ as@@ ers .
the w@@ as@@ is administration will first try to make a com@@ e@@ back before it is a prominent position this year .
if the high gas mine is not first introduced , then it will be necessary to order it to immediately stop production .
x@@ ue ju continued to fight a tough battle of rectifying and closing down .
we should make the 5@@ 2@@ 43 documents that have been publicly announced to the public , and the more than 700 coal mines that have recently been reported to be closed down .
we should regard closing down as routine work and constantly close down those small factories and mines that do not have safety conditions for dam@@ aging resources .
xinhua : coal mine safety management should be strengthened
we should immediately correct the problem of stopping the small number of large state - owned coal mines from being reduced and guide small mines in managing their operations to establish a standardized security management system .
in particular , we must focus on key state - owned coal mines , and absolutely must not allow super@@ ficial capacity to be produced .
this year 's production safety control indices demand that the number of deaths of all types in the country dropped by 3@@ -@@ 3 percent , of which coal mines dropped by 3.@@ 55 percent .
one time , a major accident that killed more than 10 people was reduced by 5@@ percent , of which coal mines dropped by 7@@ percent .
these control inde@@ xes have been assigned to the provincial - level people 's governments , and all localities are now at the grassroots level and are now being released to the grassroots level and enterprises .
statistics show that the number of people killed in the national coal mine accident in 2005 was 5@@ 9@@ 86 , a drop of 0.@@ 7@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .

( winter olympics association , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : there is a possibility that the dispatch of a v@@ ow will be un@@ settled .
tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the dispatch of a new - year - old boy is likely to be un@@ settled , according to the press release
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly said that the tur@@ in winter games were un@@ covered and used stimul@@ ants , all the athletes might face j@@ e .
the du@@ ling winter olympics held its first grand event since the opening on 16 november . al@@ v@@ a was found using a banned drug card and a non - trad@@ able drug .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that al@@ e@@ k@@ s@@ and@@ er le@@ av@@ a was removed from the winter olympics , and she won two winter champion@@ ships in the current winter olympics , and her 15 - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ al was also taken away .
the international winter league held a grand welcoming ceremony on the same day to express its gratitude to the two - year - old v@@ t@@ c .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes who have been found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games will be dis@@ qualified and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for participation , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the sports carrying and using stimul@@ ants bel@@ ongs to criminal behavior , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ants , and the law@@ break@@ ers who are still faced with im@@ pris@@ oned imprisonment of three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with italian law during the winter games to deal with the incident of using stimul@@ ants .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a four - day concession before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not go to the olympic village to search for the athletes ' station@@ ing site , but the young drug det@@ ec@@ tor will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it has been reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the winter olympics , pe@@ is@@ k@@ an@@ tor , an official of the du@@ ling winter olympics , and has handed over the d@@ oping case of le@@ av@@ ers to the du@@ ling procuratorial organs .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ is@@ can@@ t themselves have not confirmed this at present .
the russian winter team , two medical experts , and@@ re@@ w m@@ ai@@ fu , revealed at noon on 17 april that the dispatch of al@@ ex@@ and@@ er le@@ av@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to the country .
he once served in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official , believes that once a v@@ il@@ la@@ in returns to the country , this matter may ultimately be lost .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have made positive efforts to deal with the fight against d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and even if italy 's prosecu@@ tor really interven@@ es in the matter , it is difficult to say .
according to the previous practice of italian refer@@ ences to the stimul@@ ant event of their athletes , the maximum penalty for the banned is no less than that for the two years of imprisonment for the same year .
therefore , a senior italian am@@ us@@ a reporter , pi@@ er@@ re , said that the possibility of sending al@@ ex@@ and@@ er to the prison was very small , and that most of them were fines .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a abs@@ ence , the italian police could not send le@@ av@@ a to the country to take back and serve their sentences .
if a v@@ il@@ la@@ in ref@@ uses to accept the ruling , italy will also have no way to get her .
