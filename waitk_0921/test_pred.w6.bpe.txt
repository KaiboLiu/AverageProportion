experts said that since there is no rmb pan@@ els market , insurance agencies are not capable of avoiding risks , so the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should have a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the greater pressure on renminbi appreciation , china will mainly make use of its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
as for foreign exchange purchases and foreign exchange investments , under the current circumstances , we should be cautious in dealing with them .

germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional personnel
the reporters learned from ber@@ lin , july 1 , 2007 ( staff reporter wang huai@@ cheng )
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ av@@ an said a few days ago that germany should reduce the number of foreign professionals in the " je@@ wish law " and increase the number of foreign professionals to solve the problem of professional personnel employment facing germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany , 15 to 64 years old , will gradually reduce the number of labor@@ ers .
if there is no sufficient immigrants , the labor force in germany will be a 6 percent reduction compared to the current level .
however , the german employers union and the german engine@@ er association have reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers are more professional personnel .
according to statistics from the federal labor bureau , in may this year , germany 's labor market engine@@ er supply was about 27@@ 0,000 , with a total of 27@@ ,@@ 600 workers and a supply of technicians .
germany has a great potential for introducing foreign talents to protect its own people 's employment .
germany 's " zhu@@ og@@ a " stipulates that non - eu professionals are not allowed to be admitted to germany at a rate lower than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot obtain permission to work and residence in germany .
sha wan@@ wan suggested that this limit be lowered to the original limit .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously propag@@ ate theory of law
the " draft law on lawyers , " which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for examination , stipulates that those who have engaged in professional work such as legal research , such as teaching , and who have the same professional level as a senior professional , who apply for law enforcement , may be allowed to practi@@ se by lawyers after examination by the judicial administrative departments of the state council .
( june 28 , china daily )
there are laws that govern theoretical circles and the current situation in which theory is applied , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and the latter is engaged in legal consultations and legal services such as legal coun@@ sel@@ ing , legal service , etc.
for a long time , the theory of law and the current practice of law have been very l@@ uc@@ r@@ ative , and the theory of socialism has been held that the necessary termin@@ ation of the current legal system is merely the mechan@@ ized enc@@ ep@@ hal@@ op@@ a@@ thy , and the theoretical circle of affairs is the most critical piece of theory that guid@@ es the practice of instead of giving guidance .
with regard to such division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain , not to support , one side .
however , the court of law of lawyers , which is an objective law , has obj@@ ectively recognized the fact that laws are higher than legal ones .
in fact , some international law firms , such as the international law of legal system , and some experts and scholars engaged in teaching , have also come to know the law again .
in this way , hu@@ b@@ bu@@ b has undoubtedly become the dis@@ order of legal status , which has an extremely bad effect on the legal profession .
the practice of super@@ sti@@ tion in theoretical circles is not only the case but also the fact that experts and experts ' proof will often affect or even neg@@ ate court judg@@ ments , and this is also the direct expression of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain 's move to reduce terrorist attacks
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
the british government has raised the threat to the country from the highest level to the level of serious damage , indicating that the terrorist attacks in britain will not happen soon , but the attacks may still be a threat .
at present , the british police have transferred the investigation scope to india and australia .
the eight terrorist suspects arrested were all detained in the medical system and the government would take a thorough investigation into the background of foreign immigrants who have entered the medical system .
it has been learned that nearly 1,000 workers of the british public medical system have received medical treatment overseas .
prime minister bat@@ on also called for investigation of the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or relevant organizations will be required to provide background information .
do n't let the reta@@ il@@ ers go un@@ told .
the char@@ t is a " ju@@ ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ing " that gives me the greatest pleasure of natural hor@@ se and social civilization .
however , many people are in the same state of trouble when they travel in china .
both cars and tr@@ ains , the b@@ oss , will always en@@ counter small traders and some un@@ qualified intermedi@@ ary , and will be cru@@ shed .
it is not a brand name for selling color spr@@ ay c@@ akes , that is , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , that are no proof , introducing me@@ als , even fake appe@@ ti@@ te , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is very un@@ successful to become a dis@@ gr@@ ace .
in some cases , many of them have the same feelings .
if we do not enter the door , people come to hong kong to travel and bring gi@@ f@@ ts to them .
after entering the door , this situation has become more , and good y@@ ax@@ ing has been bl@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ fed and un@@ tou@@ ched .
a media report has reported that many foreign tourists who come to xi@@ '@@ an are not at all pra@@ ising the mon@@ ument , but they are very un@@ happy about the fact that many small business@@ man - made pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers are allowed to sell it all over again .
these include the construction of the b@@ ar , which is a brand of origin and a place of origin , which should be in order , calm and harmonious , and give a peaceful and peaceful environment .
the free lob@@ b@@ ying of the traders has conf@@ used people 's minds , and obj@@ ectively they have ru@@ ined these public order , thus forming a situation of pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , they have provided conditions and opportunities for the production of cer@@ e@@ al products .
what is important is that these pieces of je@@ ep are the window for building spiritual civilization in hong kong , and they are not just an image issue , but will also have an impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to make the tourism industry strong , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic and p@@ ile tourism environment to meet the guests coming from the south and to the north , who will be willing to come , who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy yield results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the south and the north . it should be said that the most urgent task is to create a civilized tourist environment .
may@@ be , the operation of small business@@ man pe@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ ler 's haw@@ kers should be standardized , and un@@ authorised business must be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely dealt bl@@ ows at them .
a civilized and orderly environment can only let the gl@@ ory come and be brought into full play , and hu@@ ax@@ ing is re@@ emerging .
in a word , let the reta@@ il@@ ers come with imp@@ ul@@ sive things .
the award of the award of the award of taking the initiative to qu@@ it the insurance industry
the city of beijing has issued electric appliances and other products as a means to re@@ pay 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily surr@@ ender their insurance .
( " xin jing bao " , july 10 )
this writ@@ er felt happy for the improvement of the family life , but he took the initiative to re@@ pr@@ ieve , and also gave the award , but his m@@ ood was complex .
vice chairman of the road construction office said that in view of the problem of l@@ uring incen@@ se and protection , encouraging the initiative to reti@@ re is an exemplary figure for other low - income households .
this example , if it is to encourage other low - income insurance personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , then it is indeed worth advocating , and if these people who want to s@@ wind@@ le those who have long been in@@ sured of minimum protection , they will not be able to be some n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the course of distingu@@ ishing and eliminating low - income households , what we rely more on is the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the protection of the minimum insurance cover for households that need to perform their duties in the course of enjoying the minimum allow@@ able insurance , such as promptly reporting on changes in family personnel and income , reporting on employment situation , and accepting peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , while the relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the long - term strategy of relying on laws to pul@@ l out of poverty is the long - term plan .
the street will give a reward to families who have been re@@ tained for their contributions .
neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds , as a first - class government organization , are to be allocated by the financial authorities to undertake their expenses .
and the money of a family member should not be fl@@ ower ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal of the low - income families has proved that they have the ability to make themselves capable of self - sufficient and , on the other hand , are the personnel applying for minimum - protection still in existence ?
the government finance fund , which is called the money for the rescue , should be provided in the snow , not to add flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang@@ yi was willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first city public promotion named sun du district in the whole country directly selected liu gang@@ yi , the first city in mu@@ tu@@ an district , to accept democratic man@@ ual service for the fourth time since taking office , and the rate of satisfaction was 9@@ 7@@ ,000 .
during a dialogue with liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a service provid@@ er .
( yesterday 's " xin jing bao " )
liu gang@@ yi 's family member might be more capable of making cadres than some of the appointed members of the group , who had made the cadres more true .
the proportion of direct election of candidates is the greatest difference between the appointment and appointment of ordinary party members , which is mainly the power source of the party , the appointment of the superior organization , and the direction of the source of power , and the former must be the first to be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom are the fundamental factors that determine how the elected person will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such a democratic process is like a democratic show .
my view is that with such a kind of democratic appe@@ ti@@ te , it is better to do so .
in view of the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i believe that public opinion poll is already a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component part of this family 's work , and we should not under@@ estimate the promotion of democratic political construction at the grass - roots level .

this is a new development project of the mechan@@ ized inf@@ an@@ try department in connection with the reality of their posts to strive to improve the overall quality of the cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during its investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some specialized wu cadres , including shi xia@@ ol@@ i@@ ang and li ju , did not concentrate their main energy on the armed forces work .
therefore , they have adopted the method of training on the basis of relying on training for local party schools , and conducted regular training for specialized wu cadres , and worked hard to resolve such problems as narr@@ owing the knowledge of specialized wu cadres and narr@@ owing their professional quality .

good will first be good at doing things
judging from the result of the competition alone , the score of 2 to 2 is reasonable and acceptable . the key is the process of the competition , and so many regre@@ ts .
if iran is the lead of 2 - 0 , then the score will be divided , which will definitely give china a different feeling and will have a long sp@@ ell of dis@@ integration .
good will never be good , but one can be said to be old .
" i am very happy to see that i will not k@@ ick a ball under the current circumstances , and the general public 's view is that china 's psychological quality is not up to the mark .
this is indeed a great fan@@ tas@@ y .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that it is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ hai , deputy director of the state council international liaison department , k@@ ic@@ ked off his trip to europe .
this unfortun@@ ate act was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was probably the dispatch of troops to iraq .
iran 's team , under a backward condition , changed the two , and the situation was immediately cut off .
the second half of the game also changed three pieces of je@@ wel@@ ry , which was not good .
overcome the problem of being good at beginning and being in@@ competent to end , and we must find the root cause of the problem .
if problems are accurately identified and the methods for correc@@ ting the problems are probably not difficult to find them .
they are afraid of getting sick and suffering from un@@ rest .
if this goes on , then the hor@@ se is still a lot more competition , old problems will still be committed , and no one can talk about the k@@ ick that everyone is looking forward to .
