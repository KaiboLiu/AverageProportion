the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report exp@@ ounds in three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s on the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures that the united states has taken , 15 times , directly mention the two terms of china 's imper@@ ial or territorial integrity , saying that as a major and newly emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete with the united states in military affairs , and if the united states does not have anti - measures , china may develop destruc@@ tive military technology , thus breaking the traditional us military
professor yao yun@@ zhu , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although high - ranking us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time in the us strategic report on national defense that china is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report for the first time clearly regards russia as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially its so - called chinese military threat , as a new strategic oppon@@ ent .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , of which the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion was for the same day .
if you add the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the united states will have to spend a bit more than 500 billion us dollars in the fiscal year 2007 , setting a record high , p@@ ang guang@@ qian said , almost equal to all other countries ' military spending .
peng guang@@ qian said that the us method of creating a threat to other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to ear@@ n more profits for the vast us arms industry group .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has repeatedly participated in the writing of china 's defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert , said : since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of national financial expenditure in the same period has generally shown a down@@ ward trend .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditure accounts for nearly 10 percent of the national financial expenditure of the same period .
in 2005 , china 's defense budget was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only one - fourth of the united states ' total military expenditure , and the per capita military expenditure of the people was only about one - six@@ ty percent of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the servicemen was about one - thir@@ ti@@ e@@ th of that of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area is r@@ oughly equal to china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so big , and who is military strength going beyond normal defense requirements ? this is a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
peng guang@@ qian said :
zhang ming@@ qing , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have to make trouble in the past and now , and will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the school of international relations at beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international ) hamas seeks to break new cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has sought to break through the cabinet
xinhua news agency , wang hao - min
the islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) of palestine won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the relevant parties ' next policy direction in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinians are stepping up consultations on the formation of a cabinet , and are actively seeking a breakthrough in the difficulty and sensitive points of future development .
the question of which one of the prime minister 's positions will take ?
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people outside are worried that hamas 's prime minister , hamas , may have a dispute with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was set up under the leadership of hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they do not accept a hamas government that holds true power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and the election of independent persons is a compromise policy .
according to reports , to obtain the greatest international recognition , hamas and domestic and foreign leaders who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect an independent palestinian national authority chairman al-@@ j@@ ah@@ ir al-@@ hus@@ se@@ in as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant authorities .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the premier 's position will take , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should play down as much as possible the hard - lin@@ e@@ up of hamas , and only by so doing can it guarantee the success of the formation .
how to distribu@@ te power ( sub@@ head )
in terms of internal affairs , the greatest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the article in the " daily " of palestine said that hamas has gathered in the air of people through social welfare projects , but in terms of governance , it lacks experience and has no cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of being in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly establishing a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are different opinions on whether or not fat@@ ah will be included in the cabinet , and one faction stands for joining the new government , thus making things possible , while the other is willing to act as a pro - independence faction in the legislative council .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as ' persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
however , hamas and fat@@ ah will also exchange views on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a cabinet that is divor@@ ced from the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ations outside the framework of the legislative committee .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list was unknown .
in view of the us and israeli at@@ titu@@ des , the technical expert - type government has also been unable to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council took office on 16 march , nom@@ inations for the premier and forming the cabinet will be completed within three weeks and five weeks .
what course should armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and refuse to use force to participate in politics .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al stressed on 9 july that resistance was the choice of the organization 's strategy .
the armed problem actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of armed forces .
hamas was elected as the first largest party in the legislative council through democratic and free means , and the armed factions of its subordinate factions , q@@ ass@@ am brigade , are also leg@@ alizing it in the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that all factions be unified into the palestinian national authority and the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a broad response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that have a lo@@ ose organization relations , such as the ma@@ ke@@ da [ name as transliterated ] , a certain subordinate militi@@ a , and the emb@@ assi@@ es of the al@@ k@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade .
hamas , who is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own administration and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to security management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is incl@@ ined to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , which are under the jurisdiction of the new government 's ministry of interior .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no such thing .

at present , we are building the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and china 's first inland expedi@@ tion station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .

the high - definition digital television gradually became mainstream in the united states
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the number of high resolution television sets ( so@@ p@@ ree ) has continued to fall and the market has continued to expand , and the us television transmission agencies have also stepped up the corresponding high - definition television programs .
the american super@@ sti@@ s of the un@@ ve@@ iled american super - b@@ ow@@ l ol@@ ive soccer tour@@ na@@ ment has become a hot - spot match for the american broadcasting industry to welcome the high - definition television era .
according to a recent report by the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill stipul@@ ating that the broadcasting industry must stop the existing simul@@ ated television signal on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and that only a digital signal can be trans@@ mitted .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ it@@ alization of the us television program has already reached a defin@@ ite timetable .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast by the us consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets will exceed that of traditional tv sets for the first time this year , while the number of digital television sets will exceed 8@@ 5.@@ 5 percent of the high resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) japan 's east china sea university has developed a new type of bi@@ of@@ u@@ el , not only with the same dis@@ cre@@ tionary power of human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of re@@ taining the substance of the use , which is small and easy to trans@@ plant . with the in - depth research , it is hop@@ eful that the kid@@ ney patient will bring a for@@ fe@@ it@@ ure .
according to a recent report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news , the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ass kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and part of the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ass is fil@@ tered with xie waste and the se@@ wage - se@@ ating d@@ na , while the other parts of the original di@@ ame@@ ter and in@@ z@@ ac@@ i@@ ac@@ ic have the detailed tu@@ be used for returning to the blood of the blood of the people , such as the he@@ d@@ ge of the blood .
the person who produc@@ es a kid@@ ney , and the person who produc@@ es the ex@@ cre@@ tion tu@@ bes , all made the sil@@ k lines in the middle sky , and the side of the th@@ in tu@@ bes filled with the d@@ ose cell@@ s with the functions of dis@@ charging sub@@ stitu@@ te d@@ ir@@ ty cell@@ s .

these challenges include : regional se@@ a@@ water levels and the lack of electricity , supply and demand in some areas are still on the high side , and because the ben@@ ign mechanism for power prices has not yet taken shape , there is still a fairly large problem in power supply , and at the same time the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and the stable operation of the power generating units will have a serious impact on the stable operation of some of the power gr@@ id structures ,

south african envoy to china said that south africa does not have a criminal act of organization , aiming at chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china today held a reception for the guests from china , south africa , to mark the 30 th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries , according to a xinhua news agency report .
he also said that the south african government will spare no effort in cracking down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu k@@ ang@@ ing said that the south african government hopes to lower the crime rate to zero and hopes that the lives and property of every foreign citizen working in south africa will be fully protected by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed widespread concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this matter and reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship among the overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on crimes .
let 's express our most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry for this and we also invite the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case in which chen jian@@ qing , a chinese fujian woman , was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
at present , police are hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals suspected to be involved in the shooting of hong kong businessmen in january was arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims was recovered .
speaking about the possible impact of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents would indeed have a serious impact on the trade between the two countries and on the negative impact of other areas , but in the long term , the impact should not be big .
according to the director of the tourism office of the south african embassy , the embassy provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists with visa - free access to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as china 's largest trading partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourist industry believes that the continuous killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
at present , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the towns and villages in south africa are sc@@ attered .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor in south africa , the unemployment rate , and the spread of guns , there is no deterr@@ ence to death , and so the crime rate is still high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and home , and this is more likely to become the target of the criminal in seeking financial attack .

xinhua news agency reporter gao xin@@ ying
although italy repeatedly issued that tur@@ in 's winter olympics was a scene of the use of stimul@@ ants , all of them might face the emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ing of g@@ ho@@ sts , judging from various circumstances , this situation is not likely to occur in this winter 's winter olympics , the main part of the scand@@ al of stimul@@ ants , the russian par@@ i@@ ah , the two russian swim@@ m@@ ers , the russian winter par@@ ov@@ ic , on their bodies .
tur@@ in winter games opened on the 16@@ th , the first case of stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening of the games . o ' ang - yu 's party was found to have used a drug prohi@@ bition card is not a lot .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the dispatch of le@@ ov@@ a has been exp@@ elled from the winter games , and the 15 - kilome@@ ter individual individual med@@ al of the women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual tour@@ na@@ ment that she obtained at this winter olympic games has also been stri@@ pped .
the two alli@@ ances in the world winter season made a two - year penalty for the par@@ a - category tour@@ na@@ ment on the same day .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are found to use stimul@@ ants at the olympic games , and will be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the use and use of stimul@@ ants by italian athletes is a criminal act , and the judicial organ has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants . the def@@ ec@@ tor is still facing a sentence of not equal to three months .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year 's barg@@ aining price , finally reached an agreement , both sides agreed to handle the use of stimul@@ ant by athletes during the winter olympics in accordance with the italian law .
after the i@@ oc 's unremitting efforts , the italian side made a concession four days before the opening of the winter games and promised that the police would not go to the olympic village to search for the athletes ' residence in the olympic games , but the athletes who had shown positive results in the drug examination would still be subject to investigation by the italian procuratorial organs .
it was reported that the italian government supervis@@ ed the du@@ ling@@ le winter olympic games officials , per@@ e@@ z , has handed over the stimul@@ ant incident to the du@@ ling@@ le procuratorate .
however , the international olympic committee and pe@@ ter k@@ r@@ ish@@ nan have not yet confirmed the matter .
russian winter team doctors and@@ mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il dem@@ i@@ re@@ ov disclosed at noon on 17 july that the dispatch of le@@ gen@@ ds has left tur@@ in and returned to china .
the former director of the china sports official , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , who had worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , believes that once the le@@ af is sent back to china , this matter may eventually be settled without a single vote .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never given a thorough solution to the issue of anti - stimul@@ ation at the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ ed in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is .
according to the previous practice of the italian p@@ ick@@ up incident , the number of b@@ ans who were given the most severe punishment was only the two years of imprisonment suspended execution .
therefore , the senior reporter of italian news agency p@@ el@@ e said that the possibility of sending a le@@ on@@ a into the prison was sl@@ im , and most of them were fined .
p@@ el@@ i also said that although the italian court could have been tried out in a abs@@ ence , the italian police could not possibly send le@@ on@@ id to other countries to take them back and serve .
if the ex@@ tradition refused to accept the ruling , the italian side would have no way to take her .
