( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time personnel and college graduates become the main force of an hour
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau issued the latest annual wage survey for 2006 , with a total of 120 posts , up from 11 to 10 , and the former post was very popular , with the result that the previous position was rising .
according to a report by a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently , more than 1 million employees in shanghai are employed in an hour .
according to a report by the " china youth daily , " graduates and part - time personnel of colleges and universities are the major component of the hour working force .
through the study of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff members are part - time personnel , with a proportion reaching 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 10 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly for technical and technical work , such as transl@@ ation and post , as well as part - time staff , up to 8@@ 1.@@ 77 percent , and the fit@@ ness category has reached 6@@ 16@@ 6 percent .
the high income is the result of many people engaging in an hour and part - time job .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will also be hard to ask for another job , just like the transl@@ ation of an example , the monthly income of an hour of work can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as mar@@ ried si@@ yi , who holds part - time financial work .
to meet the needs of individuals and to expand their knowledge is also a favor@@ ite part - time job .
for example , when a enterprise is the manager of the human resources department , he will take a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign - funded representative office .
mr ko@@ o considered that the greatest benefit from part - time jobs was to keep our knowledge updated and to have opportunities to involve another field , of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had some in@@ duc@@ tion .
as some of the hours of employment are low , the working style is flexible and free , and many graduates are gradually favor@@ ed by job - see@@ kers , and 14@@ -@@ 3 percent of them are graduates of the secondary and tertiary industries .
i started to do n't want to do an hour work , but i did a few months later , i felt that it was better to go to work on the fifth day of the ninth dprk .
after gradu@@ ating from the university , huang , he found out the job that he did not fin@@ ish enough . finally , he hung a famous name in a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play music with the background of the pi@@ an@@ o .
the work i am very satisfied with now , and the work of the environment is good for one hour and 100 yuan . what i want to do now is to find more hours to work .
it is learned that an hour work has become a number of graduates working experience in accumul@@ ating work experience and working skills to improve communication skills and to increase social experience .
the graduates are working hours mainly in knowledge and skills , and they are mostly in the relatively strong sense of knowledge and skills , such as the professional transl@@ ation and the age - oriented performing positions , with a proportion of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
the number of jobs in the work@@ force is not high , such as food promotion trade workers , sales bro@@ kers , and others , and the unemployed can be employed through simple training .
the data show that among employees in an hour , the proportion of those who were unemployed reached 3@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 0 percent , among which the proportion of unemployed in the retail sector was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , the proportion of food and be@@ ver@@ ages was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 7 percent , and an hour of employment became an important channel for unemployed personnel to work .

chinese expert : us pre@@ ach@@ ing china military threat un@@ justi@@ fi@@ ably accus@@ ations
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to promote the development of the us economy , the defense department of the united states , the defense department of the united states , and the us defense department , the report on the four - year defense review , which was recently submitted to the congress for the first time , said that china is the most likely country to challenge the us military .
experts believe that this is a major test of china 's normal national defense construction , which ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ates the military threat from china , and is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " report on the four - year defense assessment " is a new document for the defense guidance of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three sections to descri@@ be the issue of china 's military strength and the way the united states should take to respond , and the report directly mentioned the issue of china 's great debate on the two parts of the country , saying that the united states , as a major and emerging power , is most capable of compe@@ ting with the united states in military competition , and that china is very likely to develop a destruc@@ tive military technology and break the traditional military superiority of the united states in
professor xu shi@@ quan , research fellow of the department of world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the emerging power that may most likely pose a military challenge to the united states .
the first time the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's military strategy , which is a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially its military threat against china .
professor peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences ,
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " the united states president bush also submitted a bill to congress on the government budget for fiscal 2007 , including a defense budget of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the fact that the military operations in iraq and afghanistan are added to , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , creating a record high , p@@ ang ku@@ i - qian said that this is almost the same as military spending in all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian held that the united states has fabr@@ icated the threat of other countries by using the method of inter@@ v@@ ening to reflect the consistent style of the pentagon in creating enemies . its real purpose is to win more defense expenditures and to make more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts say that the united states ' huge military spending is more than $ 1 billion .
he has been involved in the research of military experts , including the military experts , who had participated in the chinese national defense white paper many times , since the beginning of the 1990 's , with economic development and the increase in china 's national defense spending , the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a trend of decline .
official data show that the year 2004 is more than the same period in 1979 , and china 's national defense expenditures account for nearly 10 percentage points of the national financial expenditure .
china 's defense expenditures for 2005 were 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - third of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about 1 / 60 of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the military is about 1 / 30 of the us military .
the us land area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal to that of the united states , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge , and in the end , who is the military strength going beyond the proper defense needs is something un@@ worthy of saying .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china arms control and disarmament association research director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that the future of china and the united states will become ri@@ vals .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been able to do anything in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a military force to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , only in asia , more than 100,000 people have been deployed .
professor li y@@ af@@ ei of the institute of international relations of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

china , hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang ju
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a victory in the legislative council election , how to s@@ me@@ ar the new government blueprint into the focus of attention in the world today .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the peace process and the relevant parties will follow their corresponding policy direction in the next step .
at the same time , the us and israel have adopted a bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude , which has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian parties are stepping up their consultations to discuss the issues of future development in the cabinet , as well as the sensitive points that involve the development of the situation in the future .
the premier 's position is a bl@@ an@@ k and a family .
hamas has been in power after it has won the cabinet , some people in the outside are worried that hamas 's next presidential election may be a difference between the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the egyptian - israeli conflict has not been resolved , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud said , adding that the new palestinian government formed by hamas has not recognized israel , and this hard - line signal has also intensified international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that has the real power , and this will threaten to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas in making flexible strategic adjustments , in selecting an independent person , it is a policy decision .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international approval , a few days ago , hamas and domestic and international leaders of egypt decided to elect an independent chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of saudi arabia , j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ i , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter who will be the prime minister 's post , the most crucial thing is that the candidate should try as much as possible to play down hamas 's hard@@ line style , so that the success of the cabinet can be guaranteed .
the power of the state should be distributed .
within the party , the pressure facing the cabinet of hamas is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " shi@@ h - pao " analyzed that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered people 's minds , but it lacks experience in governance and has a close relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governance .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partner with fat@@ ah and jointly establishing a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
the current internal debate within fat@@ ah is not the same as that of the new government , and the one faction advocates participation in the new government , and the other party ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make a positive opposition party at the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that under the persu@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to establish a legislative committee framework and to get rid of the party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but it is un@@ certain about the specific list .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - based government cannot be regarded as a form of cabinet that reduc@@ es external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form the cabinet after the new legislative committee is inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 february .
the armed forces should be the first to decide on what course to follow .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and it is firmly demanding that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect it to hold political power with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud on 9 may stressed that armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas , through democratic and free means , was elected the first largest party in the legislative council , and the party was recognized by the international community , so that the armed factions of hamas under its jurisdiction are leg@@ alizing their efforts to bring them to the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to bring all factions into line with armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a wide response , and it was also strongly opposed by the islamic hol@@ y war organization ( j@@ ade ) of palestine .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose - f@@ ated subordinate factions , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , the fat@@ ah haw@@ k , and others .
the hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that have been in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , and civil defense organizations , but the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of the interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further comment has been made .

according to a report by the financial times a few days ago , the us congress recently passed a bill , requiring the american broadcasting industry to stop broadcasting the existing simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february , 200@@ 9 , and only to broadcast a digital signal .

the state administration of safety : the key to preventing the occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents involving coal mines and other major accidents is the most important task this year .
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to launch a series of emergency rescue operations in the past year , with the number of people suffering from the accident , said liu gu@@ an@@ zheng , deputy director of the national bureau of safety ( n@@ bs ) , here thursday .
the reporter learned from the state administration of safe production on 17 april that in order to truly curb the frequent occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents , such as coal mines , coal mines are the most important of the accidents .
this year , the state administration of coal mine safety will do a good job in the following three things :
the gu@@ y continues to fight a battle to control gas .
the government will make a decision on the issue of the emergency treatment of gas before the end of this year .
if the high gas mine does not have to go before it is allowed to take a seat , it will be ordered to stop production immediately according to law .
the gu@@ y continues to fight a battle to rectify and shu@@ t down the key .
we must make sure that the 5@@ 2@@ 43 public notice to society , and the " 7@@ 0@@ 9 " mine safety report recently published by various localities is closed to the public .
we should regard the closing of enterprises as routine work , and constantly close down those enterprises that undermine the environment of pollution that do not have safety conditions .
the coal mine safety management is strengthened .
it is necessary to immediately rectify the situation of the small number of state - owned mines in which the management of the mines is sli@@ ding , and to guide the management of the small mines in a chao@@ tic way , so as to establish a standardized safety management system .
in particular , we should pay attention to key state - owned coal mines , and absolutely not allow excessive concentr@@ ation of over@@ weight personnel to be produced .
this year 's production safety control targets require that the number of people of all types in the country who died in accidents dropped by 3@@ percent over last year , among which coal mines dropped by 3.@@ 55 percent .
the death tol@@ l of the people in the first 10 months of this year will drop by 5@@ 5.@@ 0 percent , of which 7@@ 7.@@ 0 percent will be coal mines .
these control targets have been assigned to the people 's governments at various levels , and various localities are now making plans to go to the grassroots and enterprises at various levels .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9.@@ 86 min@@ ers died in coal mine accidents , a decline of 0.@@ 75 percent over the same period last year .
however , the number of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents involving more than 10 people was on the rise , and the number of people killed in the accident increased by 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent over the same period last year .

xinhua news agency reporter gao peng ding
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , the tur@@ in winter olympics has been un@@ covered during the olympics , and the athletes who use stimul@@ ants may face the danger of the d@@ oping , judging from various situations , such a situation is unlikely to occur in the first time in the current winter olympics games , the main play@@ er of the russian winter olympics , the two - year - old al@@ e@@ k@@ s@@ man@@ a , in which the two - year - old p@@ ag@@ od@@ a , was given by the
the city of tur@@ in was the first time the olympic games have been opened on 16 april , and the or@@ le@@ ans were found to have used prohibited drugs .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that the le@@ gen@@ d has been sent out of the winter olympics . she won the winter olympics two - time women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ al in the winter olympics .
the world winter bi@@ ke league ( i@@ oc ) made a statement on the same day on the same day that the two - year ban for the distribution of the viol@@ in tour@@ na@@ ment was decided .
the i@@ oc has been stipul@@ ating that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games and will be depriv@@ ed of the quali@@ fication to participate in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes ' use and use of stimul@@ ants are a crime , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate and use stimul@@ ant athletes , so as to def@@ y the law , they are also facing three months to three months to three years of imprisonment .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a long debate over prices , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to follow the italian law in the current winter olympics to handle the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants .
after the i@@ oc 's unremitting efforts , the italian side , in the four days before the opening of the winter olympics , made a promise that the police would not enter the olympic village to conduct a search for the athletes ' place , but the drug - related athletes will still be subject to investigation by the italian prosecu@@ tors .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the officials of the tur@@ in winter olympic games , per@@ ry , who has sent the arch@@ ip@@ el@@ ago 's stimul@@ ant incident to du@@ in@@ o 's prosecu@@ tors .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ e@@ z himself have not yet confirmed this .
the two - stage russian team of the winter season , and@@ mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il , revealed at noon on the 17 th that the le@@ gen@@ ds had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he was once a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports officials , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , believed that once the le@@ f@@ t@@ ov@@ ers are sent back to china , this matter might not be over until they are finally resolved .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great efforts to strengthen cooperation with the chinese government on the issue of anti - d@@ oping agents in the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecu@@ tors really involve in this matter , it is also very difficult to say .
according to the previous italian method of using stimul@@ ants to athletes , the number of illegal immigrants received by the viol@@ ators was only the two years of imprisonment for the period of the two - year imprisonment for the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the period of the imprisonment .
therefore , the italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ ans@@ a senior reporter , pi@@ er@@ re pi@@ er@@ re , said that the possibility of le@@ f@@ t@@ ov@@ a entering the prison is un@@ expec@@ tedly great , and that is , the penalty is most likely to be imposed .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could have been tried in a abs@@ ence , italian police could not possibly send le@@ f@@ t@@ ov@@ a back to take the sentence .
if we send le@@ ans to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will also have no way to take it .
