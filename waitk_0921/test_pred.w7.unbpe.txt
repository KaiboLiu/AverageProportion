experts say that since the renminbi products market is not yet available , insurance institutions are not taking adequate precautions , and the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not yet ripe .
liu lefei said : for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , foreign investment should account for a certain percentage of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given that the rmb is under greater pressure to appreciate , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
foreign investment in foreign exchange procurement should be treated with caution under the current situation .

if there is no sufficient migration , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6 percent compared with the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engineers association reported that engineers have made technical innovations in the german labor market .
according to the statistics of the german federal labor bureau , in may of this year , the supply of 14,000 german engineers in the labor market was about 120,000 , and the skilled came in with some 9600 .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a relatively high threshold for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " thruster law " stipulates that the professional talent from non - eu countries are not less than 855,000 euros in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain the permission for working and residence in germany .
sha wan suggested that this quota be lowered to the mark .
there is no need to superstitious laws .
the " draft law on lawyers " , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : those who have engaged in professional work such as teaching on legal research and are also professional at a high level , such as high level proficiency or similar professional level , and those who apply for a lawyer 's practise may be permitted to practise their work in law after being examined and verified by the judicial and administrative departments of the state council .
( " zhongguo guofu " ) on 28 june
there are legal concepts such as the theoretical circle and the practice of the system , which mainly include legal teaching and research work , etc. , which is the most important thing in legal application , and the more is the concrete actions of legal consultation , legal consultation , and other legal services .
for a long time , the legal circle has been curious and the practice of acting in practice . the theory of the law circle is not yet known as the need for the technology of the legal profession . it is only the theory of the theory of the theory circle of the circle of the industry , which has been used for a long time , is not used to guide practice .
the legal system can be done in order to maintain the discrepancy of the division of labor and not to support any party .
however , the lawyer system in the " law of lawyers " has objectively recognized the legal system , which is higher than the legal system .
in fact , some people who are engaged in scientific research and teaching on legal system and international law have made a deep theoretical study and teaching . their theory is also more profound than that of law .
this is undoubtedly an impractical legal system for the legal profession .
the superstition of the theoretical circle is not the only thing to do , but the expert and experts ' proof will often affect or even reject the court 's ruling , and it is also the direct expression of this kind of superstition .

do n't let business people take care of
the plan for tourism is to relax the mold of the mold , to the maximum extent to enjoy the fruits of natural science and social civilization .
but in china , many people have experienced such a kind of anxiety , and they are turned into a business - like commercial dealers and intermediary businesses .
whether it is a car or a train , the upper wheel always faces the pressure of death of small dealers and some uncertified intermediaries .
it is not to sell loyalty scarcakes , that is , newspapers and periodicals , and then many non - notched intermediaries introducing catches , even making false appetite cards .
if you do n't accept it , he can chase you several hundred meters , and it is very unsuccessful that you can become benevolent .
in some cases , many people feel the same .
if we enter the gate , some people will be curious about the tourist and small - size products .
after entering the house , this situation became even more serious , and yaxing , no matter how good , was also blurred and obscured .
some media reported that many foreign tourists who came to xian were not excited about the silicon monuments in xian , but were allowed to be dubbed everywhere by small business hawkers .
this includes the appearance of the locust of the wind , the appearance of the station , the appearance of the trick and the place of the air , and the order of civilization and harmony , which have given the environment of a calm heart .
the free trade of dealers has made a mess of the mind that objectively destroyed these public order and formed a system of sewage pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it also provides them with favorable conditions and opportunities for them to get rid of .
the important thing is that these people are the window for building local spiritual civilization and are tailored to see the entire leopard , and the damage is not only an image problem , but also will have an impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a big and powerful tourist industry , you will use this huge and irresistible tourist environment to greet the guests coming to the south to the north . who is willing to come and who dares to come ?
how can you achieve economic benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the northern part of the sky . it should be said that the pressing task is to be to create a civilized tourist environment .
not a market , the operation of peddlers of small businesses should be standardized , and the operation of unlicensed businesses should be resolutely abolished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
only a civilized and orderly environment can allow people to be happy and return to their original destination and to prosper .
one sentence is to make a comic show of the business dealers .
the system of giving free rein on its own initiative and dismissal of insurance benefits
the beijing dongcheng district construction company has produced some power - efficient products as a low - income family refund for 12 households that voluntarily retreat .
( " xin jing bao " on 10 july )
this writer was happy to see the improvement of the family life , but he was still using the pattern of giving him an award to repay his own initiative , but he was also very complicated .
deputy director of the jiaozi neighborhood office said that in view of problems such as scam and low security , encouraging the active retirement of insurance is an example for other low - income households .
if this model encourages other low - income people to extricate themselves from their predicament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it is used to slap the people who have long been trying to obtain low - income guarantees , it is not strange .
in the process of differentiating and clearing up low - income households , it is more dependent on the law .
departments concerned should strengthen the protection of low - income households when enjoying the minimum - income insurance , and should report promptly the changes in family personnel and income , report on the employment situation , accept regular reviews , and so on , while relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term plan to eliminate the law .
the neighborhood has given an incentive to families who have been laid off .
as a primary government organization , the neighborhood is responsible for its expenditures .
and the money for taxpayers should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the family that withdrew from the low - income insurance proves that it has already possessed a certain degree of self - reliance capacity , and on the other hand , is n't the applicants applying for low - income insurance still having their own ability ?
the government 's financial appropriation , which is called the money - saving money , should be given the coffin in the snow , and should not be used to add flowers to the brocade .
liu zhengyi is more dissatisfied with this .
on 10 july , the first public opinion poll in the whole country , the mailan town in the new kaidu district , liu qiyi , was accepted for the fourth time after taking office with a democratic satisfaction rate of 97.7 percent .
when the reporter held talks with liu , liu dianyi defined himself as a service provider .
( by xin jing bao )
liu qiyi 's mimickness service is more likely to be compared with the few appointed cadres who have been appointed more truthfully , and let some people get a bit more proficient .
the system of public - run appointments is most binding in comparison with the system of public - promotion , and the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members to decide the source of power , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power has determined that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for the person is the fundamental factor determining how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people have questioned such a democratic impregnable mimickness as a democratic curtain .
my view is that the muddled democratic system is not better than that .
in consideration of the history and current situation of the building of grass - roots democratic politics in china , i believe that the public - holding elections have already been a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this . we should not underestimate the importance of promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

pope is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president in india 's mop .
paul castro is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while shchatter comes from the opposition party 's opposition people 's party .
because the congress party has a superior position in the presidential election group , the media and the public are throwing away , and the possibility of pastrum being elected is quite large .
paul castro , 72 , is the governor of larry masanjia state .

good start still needs good treatment
as far as the result of the competition is concerned , the score for 2 - 2 is reasonable and also unacceptable . the key lies in the process of the competition , and the degree of regrets is that .
if iran leads the world 2 - 0 , then mmmmere equals , then the feeling of china 's mimeth will be very long , the mood will be very high , the mood is the opposite of the situation .
the first course of the campaign is not good , but one can be said to be a mold problem .
it is often not so easy to play the ball under the situation of the situation , and ordinary people 's views are not yet perfect in china 's psychological quality .
this is indeed a good thing that cannot be done well .
however , from the perspective of today 's competition , it seems to be the same .
sun jihai , shao xiang , shao jijia , zheng zhi , and others did not say that li wei - feng and others had been the old players in the sand field . they had seen the great knowledge and found that there would not be any problems in their psychological quality .
this mitigation was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was that it would be a temporary move to deploy troops in order to make a mess .
the iranian team , under a backwardness , was replaced by two , and the situation was immediately turned into mere mere mere .
the second half was also the third mimeter , but the effect was not good .
to overcome the problem that a good start cannot be good and the end must be accurately found .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods for correcting the problems are probably not difficult to find .
they were afraid of being ill and ill .
if this goes on , it will be a game of more competition , and old problems will be broken , and it will not be able to be expected to be kicked further .
