chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures on the management of overseas investment of insurance funds " recently came into effect , and insurance funds have more room for application of the capital market .
the chief investment officer of the china hu@@ ax@@ ing company , liu le@@ fei , believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not be large - scale overseas investment . this also means that insurance , sup@@ pos@@ ai , will not diver@@ t funds from the domestic stock market in the short run , if he does not buy funds from the domestic stock market .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that because there is no renminbi products in the market , insurance institutions are not capable of avoiding risks , and the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , in terms of the allocation of assets , foreign investment should have a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , because the rmb is now under greater pressure to appreciate , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investment .
regarding the purchase of foreign exchange , the government should be cautious in handling the current situation .

germany to reduce import of professional talent
the first session of the 11 th national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee held in ber@@ lin on 1 july .
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ av@@ a said recently that germany should lower the " han@@ he law " and impose restrictions on the import of foreign specialists , so as to resolve the problems facing germany 's professional personnel by increasing the import of foreign talents .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany is 15 to 64 years old , and the number of labor will decrease year by year .
if there is no adequate migr@@ ation , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6@@ -@@ 7 percent as compared with the present .
however , german employers ' federation and german engine@@ ers association said that the current labor market in germany is a very high - skilled worker in the field .
germany 's labor department reported that the labor department reported a big increase in the supply of engine@@ ers in the labor market in may this year , with some 17@@ 0,000 people and technicians coming to the market for 9@@ ,@@ 600 .
germany has been trying to protect its own people 's employment and has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " law on river " stipulates that professional talent from non - eu countries cannot be lower than 8.@@ 5@@ 55 - million eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be allowed to work in germany or live in germany .
he said that the government should reduce the amount of money to the dollar .
do not have super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous theories and theories
recently , it submitted to the npc standing committee a draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which stipulates : those who have engaged in the work of studying law and teaching in kin@@ men and other fields , and those who have advanced or similar professional standards , who apply for legal practice , are subject to examination and approval by the state council 's judicial and administrative departments , and are qualified to en@@ trust lawyers .
( 28 june , " chinese language " )
there are theoretical circles and people in the field of politics and law , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work .
for a long time , the theory of law has been en@@ shr@@ ined in the circles of the people , and there is a cl@@ oud of cl@@ ues . the theory circles believe that the real situation does not need to be necessary in the field . only those who practice the law of marxism are involved in the field of real affairs .
with regard to such differences in the division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain the situation , not to support any one side .
however , the provisions in the law on lawyers are not as simple as those of lawyers . obj@@ ectively , they approve the theory of law that is higher than the law .
in fact , some people engaged in activities such as the history of the legal system and the international law are purely theoretical research and teaching . their theories are very deep and are also closely related to the legal practice .
in this way , the en@@ cl@@ ement of the law is undoubtedly the result of confu@@ sion in the quali@@ fication of the law and the con@@ science of the field of con@@ science . the impact is extremely bad .
the theoretical circles of the emperor have not only kept their blind faith in the theory , but also the experts and experts have been exp@@ ecting the phenomenon of the court ruling to be affected and even rejected . this is also a direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

" the ministry has clearly stated the conditions and application procedures for the ships
the application for ships will be made in the harb@@ or of the ship registration form@@ alities for the ship .
britain 's decision to reduce terrorist attacks
on july 5 , the pla 's general staff headquarters ,
the british government attacked the terrorist attack stage at the highest level and cut down the heavy level , indicating that british terrorist attacks would not take place soon , but attacks might still be accompanied by endless cl@@ ashes .
at present , the british police will shift the investigation scope to india and australia .
because of the arrest of eight terrorist suspects , they were working in the medical system , and the government will take a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the background of migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that some people in britain 's public medical system have been working overseas to get medical qualifications .
the prime minister also demanded that the background of high - tech immigrants be investigated , and that employers or relevant organizations be asked to provide background information .
the business people are not happy about it .
tourism , the map is to relax the efforts to clear the truth and to the greatest extent enjoy natural and social civilization .
however , he said , many people have encountered such a kind of worry in the country . after the company and the company were se@@ ated and ch@@ ased in the company and engaged in intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is a car or a train , the train always has to be accompanied by small commercial deal@@ ers and some die - hard elements without a license .
it is not because they sell pe@@ an@@ ty s@@ n@@ akes , that is , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many other things are not veri@@ fied as intermedi@@ ary , such as cat@@ ering and drinking , and even using false appe@@ ar@@ ances .
if you do not accept it , he can catch you several hundred meters , and if you are big or not , you will become j@@ en .
in some cases , many people also had the same feeling .
without entering the gate , some people come to visit the temple and do not know anything .
after entering the gate , this situation will be more , and the good y@@ a@@ xing will also be sti@@ r@@ red up in a s@@ ens@@ ational manner .
some media reports have said that many foreign tourists visiting xi@@ '@@ an have praised the mon@@ um@@ ental mon@@ ument in xian . however , they are not sure about allowing the small - scale commercial haw@@ ks who have more stock of it to sell .
these include the " three links " of the station , which are originally the " one in the river " and the places in the river , the principle of " one country , two systems " should be orderly , calm and harmonious , and the environment of one being pol@@ e to one another is brought out .
the freedom of the commercial deal@@ ers has conf@@ used the feelings of the people , and obj@@ ectively they have damaged these public order in the wake of the incident , thus creating pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , they also provide conditions and opportunities for pollution .
what is important is that these things are the wind@@ ows of local spiritual civilization construction , and the entire le@@ op@@ ard is not only an issue of image , but also an impact on local economic development .
just think , you should be a strong tourist industry , but you use this kind of dis@@ orderly and m@@ ess tourist environment to welcome the guests coming to the south and north . who is willing to come ?
your tourism economy has also achieved economic results .
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , the tourist industry in the north of tian@@ nan should be regarded as a top priority .
the idea is not a market , and the business activities of small - scale commercial haw@@ ks should be standardized , and those that do not have a license should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can only make people happy and fulfill their duties and make the people prosperous and re@@ unite .
in one sentence , do n't let commercial deal@@ ers come .
the pen@@ sion re@@ wards are not enough to be re@@ war@@ ded .
the construction of dong@@ cheng district in beijing has been done as a measure to re@@ treat the 12 households who have taken the initiative to re@@ pay .
( " new beijing post " , july 10 )
this writ@@ er has been proud of the improvement of these families ' lives , but he still has the wor@@ ding of taking the initiative to re@@ treat from the peasants , but his practice of re@@ war@@ ding the peasants with the support of the authorities is complex .
the deputy director of the ji@@ ao@@ jie district office said that the problem of che@@ ating and in@@ sec@@ ting low - security is encouraging the active re@@ par@@ ations . this is an example for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income insurance workers to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating . if we want to use this to touch the people who have been che@@ ating for a long time , we will not be inf@@ le@@ xi@@ bly n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the course of distingu@@ ishing between different regions and clearing up low - income households , the law should be followed .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of low - income households in the course of enjoying the minimum - protection period : if promptly noti@@ fying the families and their income , reporting on employment situation , and accepting regular re@@ examination , the relevant departments should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , the troops re@@ treated according to law only after a long period of time .
the street has given to the re@@ pat@@ ri@@ ated families the re@@ wards they have given to them .
as a first - class government organization , the expenditure of the neighbor@@ hood is borne by the financial appropri@@ ation .
the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal of low - income families has proved that they have the ability to make self - sufficient in their own hands and to apply for minimum - guarantee workers .
the us military , which is called the lif@@ es@@ aving money , should send out un@@ char@@ ted people in the snow rather than add flowers to the snow .
liu gang@@ yi was willing to serve the service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first public - run - in - elections in xin@@ du@@ an town , xin@@ du@@ an district , liu gang@@ yi , who took office for the fourth time , accepted democracy with a total satisfaction rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at a news conference held with liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a person who works in the field .
( yesterday 's " new beijing post " )
liu gang@@ yi 's in@@ duc@@ tion service may be better than some appointed cadres .
the public - opinion poll system , which is the largest in the comparison of the candidates , is mainly composed of ordinary party members and masses , and the latter is primarily composed of higher - level organizations , while the direction of the source of power has decided that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the person who is responsible are the fundamental factors for deciding on how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such a democratic movement is more like a democratic show .
my viewpoint is that with such a democratic movement , the dpp is more likely to be a m@@ igh@@ ty man .
considering the fact that the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i think that the promotion of public opinion is a major breakthrough , democracy is an important component of this matter , and it is necessary not to under@@ estimate the importance of promoting the building of grass - roots democratic politics .
india is expected to choose the first female president , analysts said , adding that the possibility of being elected is relatively great , and that female voters hope to raise their status .

on 19 july , the cur@@ tain of india 's presidential election began . the new president will be elected as the current vice president sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze and the recent resignation of governor of l@@ j@@ ar bi@@ b@@ op@@ ar state .
p@@ ach@@ eng is the first female presidential candidate in india 's history . if she is elected , she will become the first woman president of india .
p@@ ach@@ ang is the candidate of the ruling party 's congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze comes from the opposition party 's people 's party .
because the congress party had not yet been able to gain the upper hand in the presidential election , the media and the public have been involved in the election .
the 72 - year - old p@@ ope is the governor of the state of l@@ j@@ ar province .
her husband , who went to the parliament , had rich experience , and was in the position of governor l@@ ari@@ jan@@ i , she was under the administration 's control .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a model of many cultural education and social welfare organizations .
analysts point out that the reason why p@@ ope became a candidate is because she always went to the front of chairman of the congress party of india , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has controlled the ruling congress party for a long time .
p@@ ing@@ er was deeply influ@@ enced by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believed that p@@ ope would pre@@ judic@@ ate the image of a indian woman who had a serious concept of discrimination , and raise her status as a woman .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president 's head of state and the commander of the movement , not representing any party organization , and more of which is a symb@@ ol .

a us defense department official said on 23 march that due to the iraq war and the changes in the world situation , the us defense department is re@@ considering the possibility of reducing the number of us troops stationed in europe by half .

in the world , more than 100 armed forces of a small and medium country , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , there is no uni@@ form of the armed forces of two countries .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .

the jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform has upgraded the quality of specialized military cadres .
the pla 's cao ji@@ ak@@ ui reporting from zhu@@ bin : on 18 june , a large - scale collective discussion of military cadres of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , was held by lu y@@ ul@@ an , chairman of the armed forces of xi@@ ul@@ i town , who was giving lectures on " winning psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " in western jiangsu province . on 18 june , the train@@ ees of the training class were united .
this is the first time that the ministry of personnel and armed forces have put pressure on cadres in light of their actual conditions and made great efforts to upgrade the comprehensive quality of specialized wu cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the ministry of personnel and armed forces discovered during a study and investigation at the grassroots level that some specialized military cadres had worked in their posts , and did not devote their main energy to the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating on training in the pla , using the method of training local party schools on the basis of relying on training for specialized military cadres on a regular basis , and concentr@@ ating their efforts on solving problems such as the un@@ it@@ ary quality of the knowledge of military cadres , such as the lack of professional knowledge of military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly carry out tasks and carry out tasks for military cadres , tem@@ per ourselves through our work posts , and enhance our abilities .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for appointing cadres by specialized personnel " and explicitly stipulated that the minister of the armed forces must go to the leadership group of the party committee and no longer take up other posts .
it has established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging cadres with specialized forces , and it has also established a system for cadres who are old and who are unable to meet the needs of the armed forces at the grassroots level to promptly adjust and exchange their work , and for comrades who have good overall quality and good work ability .
not long ago , the new century 's han@@ xing company , ltd. , chen y@@ ans@@ ong , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to develop the under@@ water vessel with innovation and development , thus filling the gap between the two armed forces and upgrading the technology to the company 's armed forces department .
good will also be good at the beginning
the result of the competition alone is 2 - 2 , which is reasonable and is also something that can be accepted by the people . the key is the process of the competition , and how many people are regre@@ tt@@ able .
if iran had two - thir@@ ds lead , then it would be equ@@ alized , then the chinese people would feel different .
being ben@@ evol@@ ent can not be done well , it can be said that it is an old problem .
he often said that the situation in the situation does not play a ball , and the views of ordinary people are that the psychological quality of the chinese people is not perfect .
this is indeed not something that can be done in the end .
however , judging from the contest today , it seems that it is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ hai , sun xing@@ xiang , zheng zhi@@ zhi , and others k@@ ic@@ ked in europe . li wei - feng and others were also a long - standing old veteran who had seen him through the s@@ and field . they saw that the masses could see the whole world , and that their psychological quality would not have any problem .
this p@@ ity is regre@@ tt@@ able by the iranian team , because it is probably because of the tight deployment of troops .
iran 's team , under backward conditions , was replaced by two , and the scene was immediately followed .
the second half of the match also changed three different results .
to overcome the historical problem of being good at the start , we must accurately find the root of the problem .
as long as the problem is accurately identified , the methods of re@@ moving the existing problems will probably be difficult to find .
fear that they will be afraid of being sick and being sick and going to hospital .
if the situation goes on , the prop@@ he@@ t will k@@ ick more competition , and the old will still commit , and it is impossible to say that everyone is looking forward to a further k@@ ick .

the armed police force will be changing its seven - style clothes on 1 august .
the " three stresses " education held by zhang jian@@ jun , a reporter of the pla , in beijing , will be changed one after another from 1 august .

the seven - character po@@ ster of the armed police force will be changed in three years .

the military has been shif@@ ting from training to education .
a certain base of the second artillery corps was separated from remote education and was directly linked to education .
the first time for the pla to send troops to the united states is the education organization of small units that are remote and remote directly subordinate to the party .
this reporter recently learned that after half a year of trial implementation , the base has issued the " implementation method for implementing the ' program for ideological and political education ' " to cover all the small , remote , and directly - administ@@ ered units of the base , which have already been formally put into operation .
in order to promote the " outline of ideological and political education " in an effective way , the base organized its forces at the beginning of the year to conduct in - depth investigation and study on the current situation of ideological and political education in the small units , and to influence and constr@@ ain the results of personnel who have been in@@ different to their work . a new model of education was initially formed in the small , remote , remote , and directly - administ@@ ered units .
the specific approach of the cooperation zone is to break down the establishment line of the unit and to set up a unit at the regiment level in the relatively centralized area of small , sc@@ attered , remote , and directly administ@@ ered units to conduct unified education on the theme . the units under different aff@@ ili@@ ations discussed the near tong@@ tai listening course or the remote - distance discussion of the in@@ coming q@@ in@@ gu system .
the method of linking the troops with the competition for posts should be adopted to unify the educational forces and the education hard@@ ware of the areas should be unified . the data of various units should share experience in data education and exchange experiences . typical cases in the area of the area should be organized regularly to report on their study to officers and soldiers .
each of the cooperation areas has been set up to educate people and to educate people on information .
on this basis , the various cooperation areas have also established a system for tackling difficult problems and for education and jointly handling urgent matters , such as noti@@ fying and evalu@@ ating the situations of the enterprises involved in emergency situations .
