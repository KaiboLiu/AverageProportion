china national shareholding company 's chief investment officer liu lefei said that the rmb appreciation and the domestic capital market are good , and insurance institutions will not go abroad to purchase foreign exchange through large - scale purchasing of foreign exchange . this also implies that insurance companies will not divert domestic stock funds in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that as there is no evidence of renminbi products in the market , insurance institutions are not sufficiently capable of avoiding risks , so the opportunity of large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ripe .
liu lefei said that for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should be in a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for the purchase of foreign exchange , under the current circumstances , it is necessary to be cautious in dealing with the issue .

german education and scientific research minister shvwan said a few days ago that germany should lower the " binding law " limiting the introduction of foreign professional personnel and increase the number of qualified personnel from foreign countries through increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
according to the oecd report , germany 's bogus , 15 to 64 , will gradually decline in the number of labor force .
if there is no sufficient immigration , it will be impossible for germany to reduce its labor force by 66.0 percent compared with the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engineer association reported that the german labor market is very important for engineers , engineers , experts , and technicians .
according to a report by the german federal labor agency , in may this year , the supply of engineers in the german labor market was about 127,000 people , and the supply of technicians was about 9600 people .
to protect its own people , germany has made great efforts to attract foreign talent .
germany 's " zhibang law " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries are not in germany with a slice of 8550,000 euros , otherwise they cannot get their jobs and residence permits .
sha wan suggested that the quota be lowered to binyonios .
we must not be blindly confused about law
recently , the npc standing committee submitted the " law of lawyers " to the npc standing committee for examination and approval , stipulating that lawyers who have engaged in legal research , teaching , and other professional work , and have advanced knowledge , such as high - quality knowledge , or similar professional level , apply for lawyers to work in their professions . with the approval of the state council department 's judicial administration , they may be given the right to practice in their lawyers .
( adopted on 28 june , zhongguo qingnian bao )
there are many theoretical circles and many people who are concerned about the truth . the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , such as the case of bogus violations , and the latter are engaged in litigation , legal consultation , legal services , and other specific actions .
for a long time , the law has been a mere trick and a mighty phenomenon has existed in the circle of truth . the theoretical circle has maintained that the essential thing is not necessary to do in the field of mechanics , but only the mechanics of mechanics , the truth , the truth , the truth , the truth , and the truth , the truth , the truth , the truth , and the truth of the theory of criticism of theoretical circle , which has not been
the division of labor is not a good thing for the law to do .
however , the " law of lawyers " contains a few clues to the legal system , but objectively it recognizes the law , and it is necessary to judge the law , which is more important than the law .
in fact , some people who are engaged in the theory of the legal system , such as the international law , have been studying theories and teaching , and their theories are very deep and also related to the legal practice .
in this way , the system of lawyers is no doubt a legal profession .
we should not be blindly confused about theories , such as experts ' arguments and arguments , which may affect or even reject court verdicts , and this is also a direct manifestation of this superstition .

do n't let traders take trouble
you have a wonderful idea of a few days , but you have to enjoy the most natural things and social civilization .
however , the number of people who travel in china has all suffered such a kind of worry , and they are being detained by traders and intermediary business to chase them .
both the automobile and the train , the bar , always suffer small business and some unverified intermediary tips , and they are bogged down .
not betraying the fame and burns , it is selling newspapers and magazines , and many other irregularities have introduced the food , beverages , and even falsified evidence .
if you do n't accept it , he can chase you several hundred meters , and it 's very difficult to achieve a benevolent trend .
in some storms , many people have the same feelings .
the door was not open , but some people came to visit the temple and shine things .
after entering the gate , this situation will become more serious , and the good yaxing will also be stirred up and lacked .
there were media reports that the many foreign tourists who went to xi'an , who were not at all surprised at the monuments of xi'an , but they were very displeased with the fact that more children were allowed to sell .
these include the old folk songs like the old folk , the true of the story , the old style of civilization , the quintessence of the mysterious environment , and the present situation .
the freedom of expression of traders has stirred up trouble , and objectively , it has damaged these public order . it has formed a chain of pollution and environmental pollution , and it also provides a way to complement the conditions and opportunities for them .
the important thing is that these are the main windows for the building of spiritual civilization in hong kong , and they are all - seal , and the damage is not only an issue of image , but also an impact on the development of the local economy .
just imagine , if you want to make a big effort to strengthen tourism , you will use such a disordered environment to welcome the visitors from south to north , who will come , who will dare come ?
your tourist economy is also an important factor in achieving returns .
with the surge of the peak tourist season , the number of tourists from the northern part of the country has been a civilized tourist environment , and it should be said that the moment of the moment is ripe .
you do n't have a market , and the business behavior of peddlers should be standardized , and those who do not have a license should be resolutely abolished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment can enable one to feel happy and to make one 's life prosperous and reinvigorate again .
in a word , do n't let traders take trouble .

the construction of the main streets in dongcheng district in beijing is aimed at distributing electric products , such as electric shell , to award the low - security families that have taken the initiative to protect the interests of 12 households .
( " xinjing bao " on 10 july )
this writer has made a lot of contributions to the improvement of the lives of these families , but he has also made a farewell statement to those who have made contributions to the retreat .
the building of roads in jianbao county is a deputy director of the office of the jiaojiao district people 's procuratorate , saying that encouraging people to voluntarily surrender their insurance is an example for other low - income households .
this example , if we encourage other low - income insurance personnel to shake off their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if we want to use this to drive those people who have long been deceived by cheating on low - income insurance , we cannot avoid being naive .
in the process of differentiating and clearing up the insect , we have more dependence on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the role of low - income insurance companies in enjoying the minimum insurance benefits : they should inform their families and income changes in a timely manner , report on the employment situation , and receive regular reexamination , while the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is not easy to keep things in line with the law .
the street has a negative impact on the family reeducation , which is the case , ?
as a first - level government organization , the street 's expenditures are borne by financial appropriations .
however , the taxpayer 's money should not be used ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - interest families proves that they have a certain degree of self - supporting ability and that on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - income insurance is not still present ?
the rescue team , known as the life - saving money , should provide relief in snow - covered areas rather than adding flowers to the sky .

( the " xin jing bao " yesterday )
liu contestant , who is a hero , may be more nice than some appointed cadres who have been under the system , and this is more true , and makes people feel more indifferent .
public promotion , direct election , and the most important thing in the system of appointment are the main candidates of ordinary party members who decide the source of power , the latter are mainly appointed by the higher level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determines that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for who is the key to what is the decision to carry out the work ?
some people questioned such a panic , even more like a clenbuterol of democracy .
my view is that there is such a strange form of democracy , which is better than not .
considering the reality of the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i think that public promotion of elections is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this matter , and it is of no need to be underestimated in promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

the two guests are the 07 - style military uniform design , which is directly related to the military .
speaking about the new uniform changes , they introduced that the military uniform of the 07 - style military uniform is a special combat form that has been renovated on the basis of the 97 - model military uniform , and seven aspects , including the series of binding formats , etc. , of the uniform .
the seven - style military uniform is the most important characteristic of the military uniform system .
the two guests also exchanged views on the varieties of new uniform , the pandemic of the mirror , and other issues with netizens .
this time , the chinese military online is jointly developed by the chinese military net and the chinese new wave .
the jingjiang city people 's armed forces platform has raised the quality of specialized military cadres .
the pla daily said : the chinese government has made solemn representations to the us government on 18 june regarding the issue of " falungong " in the armed forces department of xaijiang city , jiangsu province .
this is a miracle of the history of our country 's armed forces departments in conjunction with their own posts , and it is a new change in the comprehensive quality of specialized military cadres .
in early this year , the party committee of the ministry of national defense discovered during the investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some special military cadres have been in office for long , and have been in office and have not devoted their main energy to the work of arming the troops .
to this end , they have adopted the method of concentrating on training soldiers , relying on local party schools to train them , and so on , to carry out regular training for specialized military cadres , and to focus on resolving the issue of the lack of knowledge and quality of professional military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly give special - arms cadres a task of pressing forward , and enhance their ability to work in the post through training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on the bidding for posts by specialized military cadres " and clearly stipulated that the minister of the armed forces must go to the leading body of the party committee and stop other posts .
the establishment of a system for readjusting and exchanging cadres with specialized arms has greatly made some young cadres unfit to the work of arming the grassroots , promptly readjusted and exchanged , and made important contributions to promoting and using comrades with strong abilities in overall quality .
not long ago , the new century cosmonaut company , ltd . , chen yisong , led the militia technology detachments in making innovations and development , and filled the gap between domestic affairs and the upgrading of the company 's armed forces department .
good will first be good .
the results of the competition alone are 2 - 2 , which is reasonable , and also a miracle that can be accepted , and the key is the competition process , and how much regrets it .
if iran 's team 2 - 0 , then the match will be equated , that will cause a sensation for china , it will definitely be different , and the morale of the team will be very long .
good can never be good at the end , but can be said to be a problem with a man .
you often feel like a situation .
this is indeed a mess that cannot be cured and a cure .
however , from what we have seen from today 's competition , it seems that it is not the end .
sun jihai , sun xiangxiang , shao jiayi , zheng zhi , and others were kicking in europe , but li feng and others did not say that li wei and others were old men who had gone through the sandy field . they saw a wide variety of views and said that their psychological quality would not be a problem .
this is a trick that the iranian team was forced to calm , because it was probably because the redeployment would be a bit too difficult .
iran 's team is in a backward situation , and they are on the scene immediately .
after the second half of the match , three people changed their fame , but the effect was not good .
we should overcome the difficulties that are not easy to do and to end the problems , and we must find the root cause of problems .
as long as the problem is found , the method of eliminating the problem is probably not difficult to find .
they are afraid that they will take a doctor in a rush .
if this is the case , the kick will be a little more competition , and the old problem will be broken , and the kick that everyone is looking forward to is further mentioned .
