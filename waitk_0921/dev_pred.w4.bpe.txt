( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time personnel and college graduates become the main force of an hour
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau released the latest statistics on wages for the latest hour of labor and social security in 2006 , with the number of posts reaching 120 , 11 more than the previous time , and the original salary of the former post was reduced by the number of those in the past .
according to a report by experts from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently , over 1 million employees in shanghai 's work@@ force have been employed .
according to a report by zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , college graduates and part - time workers are the main components of the team of employees .
through the investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time personnel , with a ratio of 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 10 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally relatively high , mainly engaged in relatively technical work , such as transl@@ ation jobs , the proportion of part - time personnel is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7@@ 7 % , and the number of fit@@ ness classes has reached 6@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 66 % .
high income is the result of many people engaging in both - hours work and work .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands yuan , and it will also be hard to seek , just as if the word is trans@@ mitted , and the monthly income of an hour for a job may exceed 2,000 yuan , such as the money for the wed@@ ding of the si@@ qing yi .
to satisfy their personal interest and expand their knowledge is also a part - time job that is very popular with part - time workers .
for example , when a enterprise holds the positions of manager of the human resources department , he will take a few hours to handle the financial accounts of a foreign - funded representative office every week .
mr ko@@ o considered that the greatest benefit from part - time jobs was to keep updated knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another field . of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had a certain degree of attr@@ action .
as some hours of jobs are low , the working forms are flexible and free , and they are gradually being affected by many graduates who are seeking jobs , 14@@ 1 percent of the jobs are graduates of the tertiary and secondary schools in the past three years .
when i first thought of an hour , i did not want to work , but after i had done it for several months , i felt it was better than my nine n@@ ights for work .
college student xiao huang gradu@@ ated from the university , he did not care about his job and finally hung up his name at a guesthouse . he played music with a pi@@ an@@ o background .
as far as i am concerned , i am quite satisfied with my current work , and i am very happy for it , and i 'm now doing more work .
it is learned that the work of an hour has become a problem that some graduates who are seeking jobs have experience in carrying out their work and skills in enhancing communication skills in their work , and increasing their social life .
the graduates work on an equal footing mainly in knowledge and skills , and they are also engaged in jobs that are more specialized in transl@@ ation , times , and inter@@ active in performing arts , with the ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1@@ 10 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8@@ 8 % respectively .
the number of hours jobs required for some jobs is not high , such as food promotion workers and sales cl@@ ai@@ m@@ l@@ er@@ ks and hel@@ pers , and the unemployed personnel can be employed through simple training .
the data show that the number of employees employed in the industry as an unemployed person was 3@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 0 percent , of which the proportion of unemployed people in retail business was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the proportion of cat@@ ering and eating was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 7 percent , and that employment for employees became an important channel for employment .

chinese expert : us advoc@@ acy of china 's military threat un@@ justi@@ fied accus@@ ations
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a new anti - missile system ( f@@ di ) for the next four years , which is the largest military exercise in china , according to a report by the pentagon , which was submitted to the congress a few days ago .
experts believe that this is a major test of china 's normal national defense construction , and the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation of the military threat from china is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " report on the four - year defense assessment " is a new document of the pentagon 's guiding national defense .
the 92 - page report , which is a long - term report , descri@@ bes the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures it should adopt , has directly mentioned in 15 times the situation of china 's in@@ difference or the chinese language . it says that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest superiority in the potential of conducting military competition with the united states . if the united states does not take counter - measures , it is very possible that china will develop destruc@@ tive military weapons and thus
the director of the research institute of the world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times , for the first time in the strategic report on national defense , the proposal that china is the emerging power that may most likely pose a military challenge to the united states is china .
the report clearly points out for the first time that russia is the most important strategic partner of india , especially the so - called military threat against china .
guo bo@@ xiong , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences ,
what merits our attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " on the same day , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the government budget for fiscal 2007 , with the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the us military strategy in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states has fabr@@ icated the threat of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of the pentagon 's sin@@ ist@@ er attempt to create enemies . its real purpose is to strive for more defense expenses and to make more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense spending is rather limited .
he has repeatedly participated in the research and development of the national defense white paper written by chinese military experts , who have been participating in the white paper on national defense , said : since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national defense spending for the same period has generally shown a decline .
official figures show that the year 2004 is more than 1979 , when china 's defense spending accounts for nearly 10 percent of the national fiscal expenditure for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , which is only about one - fourth of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - six@@ ty of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the military is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the us land area and china 's territorial area are r@@ oughly equal , but the military expenditure is so huge . who exactly is the military power beyond the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never done anything in the past or now , and it will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military base in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor xu wen@@ yuan of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively push forward the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

china , palestine to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency reporter , huang hao ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a victory in the legislative elections , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will have a direct impact on the relevant parties ' future policy orientation of the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations to discuss the issues concerning future development of the situation in the cabinet .
the premier 's position is a fl@@ ower - like one .
hamas 's decision to form a cabinet has been worr@@ ying that prime minister ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ j@@ ad may have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the visiting hamas leader , ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d , stressed that the palestinian new government , which is led by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international anx@@ ie@@ ties .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they will not accept a hamas government that has real power and threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and selecting independent people is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international approval , the hamas - led leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to choose the chairman of the board of directors of the gaza - islamic university , j@@ a@@ hu@@ e - hu@@ id@@ ali , who is also chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant departments .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian government will not change its policy of " one country , two systems " regardless of the outcome of the prime minister 's post .
the power is distributed to the public .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of adequate experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " daily " analyzed in a written article that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered people in favor of the government , but it lacks experience in governing , and it is not in conflict with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing diplomatic relations with fat@@ ah and joining hands to form a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not responded positively to this day .
the current internal debate within fat@@ ah is not the same as that of the new government , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus getting some things done , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas , and is willing to be an active opposition faction in the legislative committee .
according to informed sources , under the persu@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet positions .
another way is to organize a legislative committee framework to break away from the party - related cabinet .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific list is un@@ clear .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technology - based government of the speci@@ alist type cannot be regarded as a form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , on the eve of the coming legislative committee 's inauguration on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the armed forces should not follow the road of development .
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another important challenge facing the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and it resolutely demands that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its participation in the administration with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d emphasized on 9 september that armed resistance was the choice of strategy of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas 's ability to win the election of first - largest party in the legislative council through democratic and free means has been acknowledged internationally , and the leg@@ alization of its subordinate armed factions is to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to split all factions into the palestinian national authority and the people 's army , but did not receive a broad response , and was also called by the islamic ji@@ had organization of palestine ( islamic ji@@ had ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose - f@@ ated armed factions , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , the b@@ ay@@ on@@ et , and other groups .
the hamas in charge of forming the cabinet must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as deliberately took charge of security and intelligence forces , police , civil defense , and other agencies in the new government , and is managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further details have been made .

statistics from the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific expedi@@ tions to inspect the exercise with the en@@ su@@ ing of the " han@@ ku@@ ang " ship , which was carried by the snow dragon boat as the platform , to inspect the bei@@ ji river . so far , over 3,000 people across the country have visited the site of the inspection team members in the southern shanxi .
now we are making efforts to establish the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and also china 's first inland inspection station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration undertaking has been conducting world polar observation .

these challenges include : regional seas@@ onal vari@@ ations in power shortage will still exist , and power supply in some regions is still on the tight side , and the ben@@ ign mechanism for coal coal prices has not yet taken shape , causing the supply of electricity and coal to remain a relatively serious problem . at the same time , the problem of falling coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and this will seriously affect the stable operation of power generating units , the weak structure of power gr@@ i@@ ds , and the grim
shi yu@@ bo said that with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be continuously exposed , how to maintain the stability of the working masses and ensure normal production order will become new problems .
in view of the power safety production work in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of the management of power safety production , speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation between the power plants and the power system , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the safety of the dam , strengthen the management of power construction , reduce the casualties , and continue to

in the face of the situation of power supply and demand , the contradiction between coal , electricity , oil , and transport is conspicuous , and various power enterprises have taken effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , no major accidents occurred in the production of power plants across the country .

the south african embassy in china said south africa did not have any secret organization to deal with the crime of chinese citizens .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a special consulate in south africa 's capital city of south africa , according to a press release from the chinese embassy here today
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu said that the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero . he hopes that every one working in south africa will live and have a safe life and property
since 2006 , more than four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a broad concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side and reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship among overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on crime .
we are sending our family members to express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences .
fu said that we have never thought of this .
according to a briefing by the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the murder of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman in fujian , in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen in january was arrested by the south african police , and the victims ' property was recovered .
on the incident of chinese citizens being killed , the payment of the compensation for these incidents is indeed not the case for the two countries .

the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 6 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism sector believes that the continuous occurrence of the chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation in 2004 is of a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism administration , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 31 , a year - on - year decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent .
currently , chinese living in south africa have about 200,000 people , and the number of villages spread everywhere in south africa .
analysts here believe that the widening gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the spread of guns , and the high crime rate , are the reasons why the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies , and they are more likely to become targets of criminal elements seeking financial attacks .

v@@ a@@ j@@ pa@@ yee will take the lead in his work this year .
if the gas mine fails to be discharged first , then it will be carried out according to law .

we should regard the 5@@ 2@@ 43 enterprises which have already made public public their public notice to society and the more than 700 coal mines recently reported by various localities as a matter of fact .
we should regard the closure of enterprises as a routine work , and should continuously close down those coal mines that sabotage the pollution of resources and environment that do not meet the requirements for safety .
the coal mine safety management should be strengthened .
we must immediately correct the practice of the minority of the state - owned coal mines that have sli@@ d down in management and who have been in charge of the dis@@ orderly management of the state - owned mines , and establish a standardized system of safety management .

xinhua news agency reporter gao peng ding
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , saying that during the winter olympics in tur@@ in , the athletes who were found using stimul@@ ants may face the danger of being j@@ ailed , judging by various circumstances , such a situation cannot possibly occur in this winter olympics .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games opened on 16 february , the first ever d@@ oping scand@@ al since it was opened , and ol@@ e@@ g le@@ op@@ ard le@@ an@@ ov@@ a was found using a banned drug card .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that le@@ gen@@ ds had been sent out of the winter olympics , and she had won two gold med@@ als in the winter olympics , one of the women 's 15 km individual champion@@ ships at this winter olympic games .
the world winter bi@@ ds league held a joint statement on the same day on the same day on the issue of bann@@ ing le@@ ases for two years .
the i@@ oc has been stipul@@ ating that athletes who have been found using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the games , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the athletes carrying and using d@@ oping agents are a crime , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the s@@ port players who use stimul@@ ants , and the law - break@@ ers are also facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of in@@ curr@@ ing the price , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to follow italian law in handling the rising problem of using stimul@@ ants by athletes during the winter olympics .
after the i@@ oc 's unremitting efforts , the italian side had made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the place where athletes are stationed . however , the medic@@ inal scre@@ ens will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the officials of the tur@@ in winter olympic games , pe@@ ter k@@ an@@ te , who has sent le@@ e@@ ks to the du@@ j@@ ail prosecu@@ tors .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter k@@ an@@ tor himself have not confirmed the incident .
russia 's second round of the winter team , an dem@@ i@@ re@@ l , revealed at noon on 17 july that le@@ gen@@ ds have left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he once worked as a member of the chinese sports officials who had been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and said that once the le@@ gen@@ ds returned to china , the incident could eventually be un@@ expec@@ tedly exposed .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been playing a constructive role in the fight against d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and even if italian prosecu@@ tors really interven@@ e in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous practice of italian athletes using d@@ oping , the italian side has not been able to get the most severe punishment of those banned by the two years of imprisonment .
therefore , the italian ant@@ a news agency senior reporter , pi@@ er@@ re , said that the possibility of sending le@@ a le@@ an@@ es into the prison is un@@ expec@@ tedly high , and the most is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could have a ab@@ sen@@ te@@ e , italian police could not possibly send le@@ an@@ es to foreign countries to take back to serve the sentence .
if we send le@@ an@@ es to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not have the way to take it .
