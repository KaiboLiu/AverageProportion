the working hours are required to be less skilled , such as food promotion assi@@ stan@@ ts and cl@@ er@@ ical cl@@ er@@ ical cl@@ er@@ ical staff , and the unemployed can be appointed through simple training .
the report showed that the average wage rate of the hours of work was 3@@ 9@@ -@@ 9 percent of the unemployed , among which the proportion of the unemployed in the retail sector was 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of food and drink was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and the hour - long work became an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

if you add to the fact that the united states is engaged in military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion , creating a new record , and the budget will be raised by peng guang@@ qian , who is almost equal to the total and spending of other countries in the world on military spending .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states has made the gu@@ y of the threat of other countries a reflection of the consistent style of the pentagon 's " making an enemy 's mou@@ th . " its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and fish more profits for the huge us arms industry .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper many times , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the state 's financial expenditure for the same period has been on the decline .
official statistics show that the volume of trade between china and the united states in 2004 and 1979 accounted for a drop of nearly 10 percentage points in the total national defense expenditure for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's defense spending was $ 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion , only about $ 2.@@ 1 - billion for the united states , and its per - capita military spending was only about 1 / 60 of the united states , and the military spending was approximately one - third of the us military 's .
hello , the us territory and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , and the difference in military spending is so huge , and is it more important to see who 's military strength exceeds the proper defense needs .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the " china 's national defense white paper for 2004 " says : china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has been unable to play a game of words and will not pose a threat to any country in the past and at present .
so far , china has not made any other country establish military bases , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor li wen@@ zhong of the school of international relations of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote world peace and development .

us , china to hold new cabinet meeting
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas 's cabinet seeks breakthrough
xinhua news agency report by reporter hao huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the victory in the legislative election of the legislative council , and how to draw up the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention .
hamas to implement what kind of new policy will directly affect the interests of the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on forming a cabinet that involves future development difficulties and sensitive points .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the issue of the post of prime minister .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people in the outside are worried that hamas 's prime minister may have differences with the inc@@ umb@@ ent supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the us delegation , which is currently visiting egypt , has stressed that the hamas - led palestinian government will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that holds the real power and use this to threaten to dis@@ continue its economic aid to palestine and to hand over the taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible tactics .
it is reported that in order to obtain the international recognition to the greatest extent , the hamas and chinese leaders who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect an independent person j@@ al@@ al j@@ ah@@ ar , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , to serve as the new prime minister .
this move has not been accepted by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , h@@ ass@@ an , said that no matter how much the prime minister 's post will fall , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to weak@@ en hamas 's most tough color and ensure the success of the formation of the cabinet .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the issue of how to distribu@@ te power .
from an internal perspective , hamas 's task of forming a cabinet is to lack sufficient ruling experience .
the palestinian newspaper " jing@@ ji bao " analy@@ tically said that hamas has gathered in the people 's minds through social welfare projects , but in the aspect of power there is no experience , and it is in the same way as the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has gained experience in power .
hamas has been putting forward a proposal to establish a political partnership with fat@@ ah after the election to jointly establish a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
the fat@@ ah is now making a decision on whether to join the cabinet . the one faction advocates participation in the new government , which will be able to do something . the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation . it is willing to make an active opposition in the legisl@@ ature .
the source said that the chinese government has been trying to persu@@ ade the palestinian people to join the new government .
even though this is the case , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of the cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee framework beyond the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean expert model government . however , the specific list is unknown .
in view of the fact that the us and israel have different at@@ titu@@ des , the technology expert government is also not at all a form of cabinet organization to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new palestinian legislative council will be elected on 16 june after its inauguration .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the question of where to follow the armed forces .
hamas 's weapons are the most powerful weapon to form a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded hamas to abandon violence and rej@@ ect the participation of the armed forces in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ar al-@@ ass@@ ad emphasized on 9 april that armed resistance was a strategic choice made by this organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the two sides of the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas 's political system of democracy and freedom was elected the first major party of the legislative council through the form of democracy and freedom , and the armed factions of its subordinate factions were similarly leg@@ alized , and the way to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to extend the armed forces of various factions to the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a wide response , and was also strongly opposed by the islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ aw@@ ad ) of palestine .
the palestinian government has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , the fat@@ ah also has some organization relations that are lo@@ ose .
the new government , which is responsible for the formation of the cabinet , must have a consensus with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that each has its own government and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management authority .
according to local media , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil air defense , and other organizations , and the new government 's interior ministry is to be returned to the administration .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further document has been signed .
