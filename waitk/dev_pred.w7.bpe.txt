according to a relevant expert of the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently more than 1 million h@@ our@@ ly workers have been employed in shanghai .
according to a report by the " zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , " college graduates and part - time staff are the major components of the h@@ our@@ ly workers ' team .
through the survey of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time workers , and the percentage has reached 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly engaged in the work of relatively strong technical skills , such as transl@@ ation and part - time personnel , reaching 8@@ 1.@@ 77 percent , and health - care at@@ tainment of 6@@ 1.@@ 6 percent .
the high income is the important reason why many people are engaged in h@@ our@@ ly jobs .

to satisfy individual interests and to expand their knowledge , it is also a major reason for hir@@ ing part - time workers to find favor with them .
for example , when a certain enterprise becomes a human resources manager , several hours will be taken weekly to handle the work of handling the financial accounts of a foreign representative office .
mr ko@@ o considers that the biggest gain from part - time duties is to keep up with up@@ d@@ ating his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another field . of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month is also given a certain en@@ tic@@ ement .
as some hours of employment thre@@ sh@@ olds are low , the employment forms are flexible and free , and are gradually becoming popular among many graduates who are currently seeking jobs , 14@@ 4 % of them are graduates of secondary and secondary schools in the past three years .
m@@ im@@ ic@@ king me at the beginning did not want to do an hour job , but after a few months i thought it was better than the nine - five days working in the dprk .
after gradu@@ ating from xiao huang , a university graduate , he did not work as satisfactory as he had done . finally , he hung up his name at a hotel and played a pi@@ an@@ o background music with a pi@@ an@@ o .
m@@ ud@@ dy , i am quite satisfied with the work now , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good . what i want to do now is a few more hours of work .
it is understood that working hours have become accumul@@ ation of experience of some graduates who are currently seeking jobs , and improving their skills in training while improving communication skills , increasing their social experience .
graduates work hours mainly in knowledge and technical skills , and they are more competent in professional work such as transl@@ ation jobs , times - specific jobs , and modern performing arts jobs .
some of the jobs for hours are not high , such as m@@ uni@@ tions for food promotion agents , etc. , unemployed personnel can take up jobs after simple training .
the data showed that among the h@@ our@@ ly employed workers , 3@@ 9@@ ,000 were originally unemployed , of which the proportion of unemployed in retail sales was 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and the hours of work became an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

china 's scholar on us arms threat to china , china 's military threat
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to support the u.s. congress in its " four - year " defense review report , which was formally submitted to congress a few days ago , according to the pentagon 's report on the defense review of china , which said that it is the emerging major country which may challenge the us military .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and plays up the military threat theory of china , and is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new document guiding the pentagon 's national defense .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures the united states should take . it has directly mentioned china 's military strength or its relationship with china 's , or china 's , two gl@@ os@@ s@@ ary , saying that as a major and newly emerging power , china has the greatest potential to conduct military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not counter the anti - control measures , china will very likely develop its military
the chinese academy of military sciences ' research department of world military studies , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions , it was the first time in the defense strategy report , china proposed that china is most likely to constitute a rising power in the united states military challenge to the united states .
for the first time , the report clearly puts russia on china as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially china 's emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , giving greater attention to the so - called military threat theory of china .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " on the same day , us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , of which the national defense budget reached $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if it add to the military action that is being carried out in iraq and afghanistan , the national defense budget for the fiscal year of the united states will break the $ 500 - billion mark , setting a new record high , and marking a new record high . this is almost equivalent to the total military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian held that the united states ' tac@@ tic of creating a sign@@ board of other countries shows the true us style of the pentagon building its real enemy , with the aim of winning more defense expenses and gaining more profits for us arms industrial groups .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in the drafting of the white paper on china 's national defense on many occasions , said : since the 1990 s , as china 's economy has developed , its national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the overall proportion of the country 's fiscal expenditures has shown a tendency of decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for a drop of nearly 10 percentage points in the same period of the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 24@@ 4@@ 6.@@ 56 billion yuan , just about one - four@@ ths of the united states ' national defense spending , and the per capita national military spending was only about 1 / 60 of the united states ' per capita , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ds of the us military spending .
the land area of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so great . who 's the military strength that is actually greater than the normal defense needs ? this is a m@@ ere m@@ ere shad@@ ow .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and present , not yet bin@@ ding on the word , will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas and deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the government of the hamas sought to break through the cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , aug@@ . 21 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council election , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what kind of new policy hamas will implement will directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step of their corresponding policy direction .
at the same time , the us and israeli bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added vari@@ ables to the prospect of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that involve future developments .
the post of prime minister will take up the right and the wrong place
after hamas obtained the cabinet , some people in the outside worried that hamas might hold a difference with the current hamas leader , hamas , while m@@ igh@@ ty , will probably be in power .
moreover , the hamas leader , al-@@ ass@@ ad , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their opposition to a hamas government that has the power to control the situation and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise policy to select independent people .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as much as possible , hamas leaders at home and abroad who are gathering in egypt decided to elect the independent hamas member , j@@ em@@ al hu@@ da , chairman of the board of directors of the shar@@ a islamic college , recently to become the new prime minister .
this measure has not yet received response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that no matter how difficult the prime minister 's position is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to play down the tough sh@@ ell of hamas as much as possible , only by ensuring that the cabinet is formed successfully .
how to distribu@@ te power
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing the cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
an article in the palestinian " shi@@ h pao " analyzed : hamas has attracted people 's attention through its social welfare projects , but in its governance it lacks experience and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partn@@ er@@ ships with fat@@ ah to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not yet given a positive response to this .
within fat@@ ah , there is different opinion on whether to join the cabinet , and each faction advocates participating in the new government , so that it can accomplish something , while the other faction is willing to play a positive role in the legislative yuan in the legisl@@ ature , on whether or not to be a pro - active opposition party .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to break away from the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet , which is to form the legislative yuan .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean , expert - type government , but the specific name list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is also im@@ proper to form a cabinet system to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council takes office on 16 february , nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israeli attitude is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its participation in politics by holding a gun .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic option for the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas was elected to the legislative council 's largest party through democratic and free means , and the armed factions of its subordinate armed factions , li@@ ke@@ wise , leg@@ alized by q@@ us@@ ay brig@@ ades , are to bring them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to re@@ unify the various factions into the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a widespread response , and was also opposed by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ha@@ h ) of palestine .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the great majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose - f@@ led@@ ged armed factions , such as the + k@@ us@@ a marty@@ rs ' movement , et@@ c , in the m@@ ud@@ a , the m@@ im@@ a eag@@ le , etc.
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must consult with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that each has its own way and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , etc. , and are managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further text .

the report points out that in the past 20 - odd years , china 's polar survey has never reached its limit , has developed constantly , and has a new size of the initial stage . it has formed a scientific research system of the north - ka expedi@@ tion system built on a ship of three king@@ s@@ ons in the south , namely , the long southern polar city station built in february 198@@ 5 , the southern pol@@ e station established in february 1989 , the north pol@@ e station established in july 2004 , and
according to the " report , " by the end of 2005 , china has conducted 22 scientific expedi@@ tions in the south pol@@ e , and has made a total of 22 inspection trips to the north pol@@ e on 2 august , conducted by the north pol@@ e scientific research station , with a ship lo@@ aded in the north pol@@ e , and has now visited the k@@ it@@ ty r@@ us of the north pol@@ e . more than 3,000 people have visited the k@@ on@@ ka site in person .
at present , we are working to build the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and are also the first inland investigation and research station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration undertaking has taken a place in the world 's polar exploration , but compared with other major polar exploration projects , it still has a rather big gap . we must catch up with our pre@@ y to our pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors .
he said .

the newly created us super@@ c@@ in r@@ ay r@@ us@@ sell has become a us broadcasting industry 's way to gre@@ et the age of the t@@ all era .
according to a recent report by the " financial times , " the us congress recently passed a bill which stipulates that american broadcast industry employees must completely stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 and can only broadcast digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the broadcast of us television programs has a clear timetable .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the us consumer electronics association , the sales of digital television sets in the united states will exceed the traditional television for the first time this year . among the digital television sets , 8@@ 5.@@ 0 percent are high - resolution products .

south african envoy to china says there is no sign of organized criminal behavior against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the south african embassy in china ( south african embassy ) is ready to further strengthen cooperation with china in the coming years , said minister con@@ in , charge d@@ '@@ aff@@ ai@@ res of the south african embassy in china , in an interview with xinhua reporters on the 13@@ th .
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
he said that the south african government hopes to reduce the rate of crime to zero and hopes that every foreigners working in south africa will receive the local law and citizens ' protection of the life and property of every foreigners working in south africa .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed its extensive concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this matter and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention . the overseas chinese have strengthened their unity and friendship and cooper@@ ated with the police to crack down on criminal activities .
we express our most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims .
" we are shocked by this , but we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is now seriously investigating each case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of the murder of chinese woman chen jian@@ qing in south africa on 5 february . one suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspects involved in the shooting of a hong kong business@@ man were arrested by the south african police and the property of the victim has been recovered .
speaking on the possible impact of the killing of chinese citizens , k@@ on@@ en said that these events would indeed produce a positive impact on the trade between the two countries and on some negative impacts on the exchanges in other fields . from a long - term point of view , however , the impact should not be great .
according to the commissioner of tourism of the south african embassy , the embassy sent over 2,000 chinese tourists to the south african country in the first 15 days of this year alone .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's position as the biggest trading partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has a clear impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism administration , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 3 percent over the same period last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and they are spread all over the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that south africa 's gap with the rich and poor , high unemployment rate , and un@@ checked spread of guns are not threatened by death , and therefore the crime rate is in the high position .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and homes , and this is more likely to become the targets of criminal elements ' pursuit of money and attacks .

the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and will be dis@@ qualified from participating in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , it is a criminal act for athletes to carry and use stimul@@ ants , and the judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants and to def@@ y the law for three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year - long barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to settle the issue of using xing@@ d@@ in for athletes in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .

shi kang song said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great efforts to stop the issue of anti - d@@ oping ag@@ ent of the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organ has really interven@@ ed in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous events of italy using stimul@@ ants against its own athletes , the most important pen@@ alties imposed on the banned are merely two years of imprisonment , which is carried out by a bu@@ f@@ fer period of two years .
therefore , senior correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re of the italian ant@@ a news agency said that the possibility of le@@ v@@ a entering the prison is mil@@ d , and most of it is a fine .
p@@ ie@@ e@@ e also said that although the italian court could have a abs@@ ence of the trial , the italian police could not possibly arrest le@@ v@@ a abroad and take him back to prison .
