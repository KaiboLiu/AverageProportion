the graduates work on an equal footing mainly in knowledge and skills , and they are also engaged in jobs that are more specialized in translation , times , and interactive in performing arts , with the ratio of 22.110 % and 26.88 % respectively .
the number of hours jobs required for some jobs is not high , such as food promotion workers and sales claimlerks and helpers , and the unemployed personnel can be employed through simple training .
the data show that the number of employees employed in the industry as an unemployed person was 399.0 percent , of which the proportion of unemployed people in retail business was as high as 68.44 percent , and the proportion of catering and eating was 58.77 percent , and that employment for employees became an important channel for employment .

chinese expert : us advocacy of china 's military threat unjustified accusations
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a new anti - missile system ( fdi ) for the next four years , which is the largest military exercise in china , according to a report by the pentagon , which was submitted to the congress a few days ago .
experts believe that this is a major test of china 's normal national defense construction , and the exaggeration of the military threat from china is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " report on the four - year defense assessment " is a new document of the pentagon 's guiding national defense .
the 92 - page report , which is a long - term report , describes the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures it should adopt , has directly mentioned in 15 times the situation of china 's indifference or the chinese language . it says that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest superiority in the potential of conducting military competition with the united states . if the united states does not take counter - measures , it is very possible that china will develop destructive military weapons and thus
the director of the research institute of the world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yunzhu , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times , for the first time in the strategic report on national defense , the proposal that china is the emerging power that may most likely pose a military challenge to the united states is china .
the report clearly points out for the first time that russia is the most important strategic partner of india , especially the so - called military threat against china .
guo boxiong , a researcher at the chinese academy of military sciences ,
what merits our attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " on the same day , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the government budget for fiscal 2007 , with the defense budget reaching $ 439.3 - billion .
if you add to the us military strategy in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guangqian said : the united states has fabricated the threat of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of the pentagon 's sinister attempt to create enemies . its real purpose is to strive for more defense expenses and to make more profits for the us munitions industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense spending is rather limited .
he has repeatedly participated in the research and development of the national defense white paper written by chinese military experts , who have been participating in the white paper on national defense , said : since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national defense spending for the same period has generally shown a decline .
official figures show that the year 2004 is more than 1979 , when china 's defense spending accounts for nearly 10 percent of the national fiscal expenditure for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 244.656 billion yuan , which is only about one - fourth of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - sixty of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the military is about one - thirds of the us military .
the us land area and china 's territorial area are roughly equal , but the military expenditure is so huge . who exactly is the military power beyond the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guangqian said :
china arms control and disarmament association director teng jianqun said that the us side should objectively evaluate china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .

china , palestine to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency reporter , huang hao ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a victory in the legislative elections , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will have a direct impact on the relevant parties ' future policy orientation of the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israel 's boycott has added variables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations to discuss the issues concerning future development of the situation in the cabinet .
the premier 's position is a flower - like one .
hamas 's decision to form a cabinet has been worrying that prime minister mahmud ahmadinejad may have differences with the current top leader abbas .
moreover , the visiting hamas leader , mahmud , stressed that the palestinian new government , which is led by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggravated international anxieties .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they will not accept a hamas government that has real power and threatened to halt economic aid to palestine and hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruct hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and selecting independent people is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international approval , the hamas - led leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to choose the chairman of the board of directors of the gaza - islamic university , jahue - huidali , who is also chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant departments .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian government will not change its policy of " one country , two systems " regardless of the outcome of the prime minister 's post .
the power is distributed to the public .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of adequate experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " daily " analyzed in a written article that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered people in favor of the government , but it lacks experience in governing , and it is not in conflict with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing diplomatic relations with fatah and joining hands to form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded positively to this day .
the current internal debate within fatah is not the same as that of the new government , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus getting some things done , while the other faction refuses to invite hamas , and is willing to be an active opposition faction in the legislative committee .
according to informed sources , under the persuasion of abbas , fatah is gradually inclined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet positions .
another way is to organize a legislative committee framework to break away from the party - related cabinet .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific list is unclear .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technology - based government of the specialist type cannot be regarded as a form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , on the eve of the coming legislative committee 's inauguration on 16 february , the work of nominating prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the armed forces should not follow the road of development .
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another important challenge facing the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and it resolutely demands that hamas abandon violence and reject its participation in the administration with guns .
hamas leader mahmud emphasized on 9 september that armed resistance was the choice of strategy of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the legality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas 's ability to win the election of first - largest party in the legislative council through democratic and free means has been acknowledged internationally , and the legalization of its subordinate armed factions is to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to split all factions into the palestinian national authority and the people 's army , but did not receive a broad response , and was also called by the islamic jihad organization of palestine ( islamic jihad ) .
palestine now has more than 60,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah also has some loose - fated armed factions , such as the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , the bayonet , and other groups .
the hamas in charge of forming the cabinet must hold talks with abbas on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands , and rationally distribute security management powers .
according to local media reports , abbas deliberately took charge of security and intelligence forces , police , civil defense , and other agencies in the new government , and is managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further details have been made .

however , he pointed out that as the situation of power supply and demand changes and the large number of newly built power generating units have been put into operation one after another , the production of power safety will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seasonal variations in power shortage will still exist , and power supply in some regions is still on the tight side , and the benign mechanism for coal coal prices has not yet taken shape , causing the supply of electricity and coal to remain a relatively serious problem . at the same time , the problem of falling coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and this will seriously affect the stable operation of power generating units , the weak structure of power grids , and the grim
shi yubo said that with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - seated contradictions will be continuously exposed , how to maintain the stability of the working masses and ensure normal production order will become new problems .

the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side and reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship among overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on crime .
we are sending our family members to express the most sincere sympathy and condolences .

according to a briefing by the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the murder of chen jianqing , a chinese woman in fujian , in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hunting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen in january was arrested by the south african police , and the victims ' property was recovered .

according to official statistics , south africa 's gdp will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7.27 billion , up 23.6 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism sector believes that the continuous occurrence of the chinese citizens ' assassination in 2004 is of a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism administration , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 2031 , a year - on - year decrease of 14.99 percent .
currently , chinese living in south africa have about 200,000 people , and the number of villages spread everywhere in south africa .
analysts here believe that the widening gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the spread of guns , and the high crime rate , are the reasons why the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies , and they are more likely to become targets of criminal elements seeking financial attacks .

after the ioc 's unremitting efforts , the italian side had made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the place where athletes are stationed . however , the medicinal screens will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervises the officials of the turin winter olympic games , peter kante , who has sent leeks to the dujail prosecutors .
however , the ioc and peter kantor himself have not confirmed the incident .
russia 's second round of the winter team , an demirel , revealed at noon on 17 july that legends have left turin and returned to china .
he once worked as a member of the chinese sports officials who had been working in the world anti - doping agency for many years , and said that once the legends returned to china , the incident could eventually be unexpectedly exposed .
shi said that the ioc and the italian government have been playing a constructive role in the fight against doping in the winter olympics , and even if italian prosecutors really intervene in this matter , it is hard to say .

therefore , the italian anta news agency senior reporter , pierre , said that the possibility of sending lea leanes into the prison is unexpectedly high , and the most is a fine .
pierre also said that although the italian court could have a absentee , italian police could not possibly send leanes to foreign countries to take back to serve the sentence .
if we send leanes to refuse to accept the verdict , the italian side will not have the way to take it .
