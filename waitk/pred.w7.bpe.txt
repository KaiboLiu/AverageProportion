prc expert on us ' military threat ' to china
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a national defense university in the united states , which will be submitted to congress a few days ago , to the us congress , the pentagon said for the first time that china 's " transit " is the emerging country that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and it is a pre@@ l@@ ude to the military threat theory of china and an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new document of the pentagon 's national defense guidance .
the report , which has a long 92 page , used three sections to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , has directly mentioned china 's two terms of " china " or " china 's " two e@@ ti@@ qu@@ et@@ te , saying that china , as a major and emerging power , has the greatest potential to engage in military competition with the united states , and that if the united states does not have any countermeasures , it will very likely develop destruc@@ tive weapons
the research fellow of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the most likely new big country that will pose military challenges to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia 's m@@ og@@ g@@ y as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called " china military threat theory " .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " us president bush also submitted a report on the fiscal year 2007 to congress , including the national defense budget reaching 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the united states add to its military actions in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for national defense in fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion , creating a new record , the k@@ u k@@ uan chi@@ u said , " this is almost the same as the total military expenditure of all other countries in the world . "
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' tr@@ ick of fabr@@ icating the threat of other countries reflects the long - standing style of the pentagon to create enemies . its real purpose is to win more national defense expenses and to re@@ ap more profits for the us m@@ am@@ mo@@ th arms industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts in the white paper on china 's national defense , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's defense spending has increased somewhat , but the overall proportion of the state 's fiscal expenditure for the same period has shown a trend of decline .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for more than 10 percent of the state 's fiscal expenditure for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense budget was 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' , and the per capita national military expenditure was only about one - 60 of the united states ' , and the per capita military spending was approximately one - thir@@ ds of the us military 's total .
the united states ' land area is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so great . who 's exactly who 's military strength exceeds the need for proper defense . this is a m@@ ere m@@ ere tr@@ um@@ p .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been in a position to pose any threat to any country in the past and at present .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other countries , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively push forward the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to promote world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough in cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough in the new cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 21 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative elections , how to draw up a new government blueprint has become the focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas implement have a direct impact on the relevant parties ' policy orientation for the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added new vari@@ ables to the hamas government 's prospects .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points involved in the formation of the cabinet and actively seek breakthroughs on the issues related to the future development of the situation .
the premier 's job will be a little over .
after hamas won the cabinet , some people in the outside were worried that hamas 's current prime minister might have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly stated that they will not accept a hamas government with real power and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer tax to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting an independent person is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international approval to the maximum , hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect the independent j@@ em@@ ir hu@@ id@@ ali , chairman of the board of directors of the shar@@ m el - she@@ i@@ k@@ h islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ ni hos@@ se@@ in , said that the most crucial thing is to choose the prime minister to play down hamas 's hard - line color as much as possible , only in this way can the government be successful .
how to distribu@@ te power
within the party , the biggest challenge facing the cabinet is that there is a lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestine " daily " carried an analysis saying that hamas has attracted people 's attention through social welfare projects , but in terms of governance , it lacks experience and is closely linked to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governance .
hamas has proposed to establish a political partner with fat@@ ah after the election to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to it .
there are now opinions on whether fat@@ ah will join the cabinet , and there are different opinions on whether to join the new government , so that it will be able to do something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to accept hamas , and is willing to act as a pro - active opposition in the legislative yuan .
informed sources pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold a barg@@ aining on the allocation of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative council framework to break down the cabinet of the party aff@@ ili@@ ated to the party .
hamas also designed a clean - up government . however , the specific name list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technical expert - type government has no choice but to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law " , the new legislative council chairman nom@@ inated the prime minister and formed the cabinet after taking office on 16 february will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course will the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude , and they have firmly demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to participate in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on the 9@@ th that armed resistance is the strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected to the first major party in the legislative committee through democracy and freedom , and its subordinate armed factions , b@@ im@@ on@@ thly , were also leg@@ alized by a b@@ m@@ w , which was to bring it into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that all factions be re@@ united as the palestinian national authority , the people 's armed forces be defeated , but they did not receive a broad response and were criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ha@@ h@@ id ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some armed police factions under a sl@@ ack organization relationship , such as the al@@ bu@@ m marty@@ rs b@@ ak@@ er , the m@@ ai - la , etc.
hamas , who is responsible for forming the cabinet , must exchange views with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate their security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , and civil defense organizations , while the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

at present , we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station and also the first inland survey station in china .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration undertaking has taken a seat in the world , but it is still far from being a major super@@ power in other countries . we must look at it as if we still have a big gap .

japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) japan 's east china university research personnel have developed a biological kid@@ ney , which is not only similar to human kid@@ ney , but also a case of re@@ tention of the virus in the united states , which is a small body and easily trans@@ plant .
according to a report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and some are trans@@ cri@@ pt from the blood of the d@@ xie waste and the tr@@ ough of the e@@ ars . another part of the bi@@ ome@@ tr@@ ic ac@@ id is used to re - return to the blood 's k@@ ur@@ king through the original water di@@ ame@@ ter and am@@ id@@ o k@@ is@@ i .
the h@@ ack@@ er h@@ all@@ marks and the h@@ ack@@ er 's di@@ m@@ er are made up of the central sky , and arti@@ ficial ur@@ ine is full of the inner side of the arti@@ ficial ur@@ ine , which is designed to dis@@ solve the de@@ tr@@ im@@ ental waste .
this type of sk@@ in cell can cause many blood - dr@@ illing analysis to make the disease even worse , the inter@@ related de@@ pression of the same bre@@ ath is de@@ formed into a hy@@ dro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ic ac@@ id and return to the p@@ h , and at the same time can also bring the blood - we@@ ed blood and mineral products that are essential to their bodies back to the blood .
and in the past , the difference between the man - made kid@@ ney relying on se@@ epage pressure on fil@@ ter waste cannot completely be eliminated , and there is no need for the ac@@ id and other elements to return to the blood .
researchers used the she@@ ep to carry out biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney trans@@ plant experiments , and the use of p@@ ig@@ s inside the center - space sil@@ k line of arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that man - made kid@@ ney has been able to function .
currently they are developing biological human gen@@ es for using human ne@@ al cell@@ s and will be tested after testing their safety .

he said the south african government will try its best to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
the south african government hopes to lower the rate of crime to zero , hoping that every south african citizen working in south africa will have a better life and property safety , he said .

let 's express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry for this and also want the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully solved the case of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman , who was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
police are hun@@ ting down another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspects involved in the shooting of hong kong businessmen in january have been arrested by the south african police and the victims ' property has been recovered .
speaking on the possible impact of the chinese citizens ' murder , k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents are indeed very important for the trade between the two countries and for trade between the two countries and for exchanges in other fields . however , from a long - term point of view , the effect of the f@@ os@@ s@@ il should not be too big .
according to the south african embassy tourism commissioner , the embassy has only sent a letter of apology to more than 2,000 chinese in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trading partner in africa in 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7@@ 27 - billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 7 percent from the same period last year .

according to statistics from the south african tourism administration , in the first half of 2005 , there were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists visiting south africa , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent over the same period of last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and there are towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the south african gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the spread of fire@@ arms have not been threatened by death , and the crime rate is in a high position .
many chinese do not understand english , and they have cash in their bodies and homes , and they are more likely to become targets of criminal elements ' plo@@ ts to seek money .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ant news analysis : the dispatch of the list of children may not be a complete success .
du@@ ling@@ ling , february 17 ( xinhua ) the incident of as@@ signing a list of children may not be settled
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 6 , by w@@ ire
although italy has repeatedly said that the tur@@ in winter olympic games was un@@ earth@@ ed by athletes who used stimul@@ ant ag@@ ent during the tur@@ in winter games , they may face j@@ ail disaster . however , judging from various circumstances , such a situation is not likely to occur in the main play@@ er of the first winter olympics , the main play@@ er , the russian br@@ on@@ ze bal@@ let , which is the first set up scand@@ al .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games opened on the 16@@ th , the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening of the games . o@@ . le@@ il@@ a police station was found to have used a number of drug - free cards .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the dispatch of le@@ gen@@ a had been ex@@ ited from the winter olympics , and her 15 - kilome@@ ter silver med@@ al in the winter olympics games had been depriv@@ ed of her .
the international winter 2 league made a decision on the same day to send emb@@ rac@@ es for two years .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes have been discovered to use stimul@@ ant d@@ oping in the olympic games and will be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition but will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal activities , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who try to def@@ y the law will still face imprisonment ranging from three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of bu@@ m@@ per price re@@ payments , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to handle the use of stimul@@ ant by athletes in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made a concession four days before the winter olympics opening , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to search the athle@@ te 's place during the winter olympics games , but the drug - oriented athletes would still be investigated by italian prosecu@@ tors .
it is reported that the italian government over@@ sees the du@@ in@@ ling winter olympics , per@@ e@@ z , who has handed over to du@@ in@@ gr@@ ad 's prosecu@@ tor for the case .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ ry himself have not yet confirmed the matter .
russian te@@ amm@@ ate and@@ ri@@ a mi@@ to@@ ov disclosed on the afternoon of 17 july that the dispatch of al@@ bu@@ ms had left du@@ in@@ ling and returned to china .
he had served in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that once a list of v@@ end@@ ors returned to china , it would be possible that this incident could not be settled for many years .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have been playing a positive role in the winter olympics , but they have not yet solved the problem even if the italian prosecu@@ tors really interven@@ ed in this matter .
according to the previous incident of italian athletes using stimul@@ ant , the banned are subject to the maximum penalty for the illegal ones , but they are also a two - year imprisonment bu@@ f@@ fer period for execution of the penalty .
therefore , senior correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re of the italian an@@ th@@ a society said that the possibility of sending li@@ u@@ bi to prison is very small , and the highest is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could have a abs@@ ence of a trial , italian police could not get a large number of pu@@ pil@@ s abroad to get back and take them to justice .
if a lev@@ y ref@@ uses to accept the ruling , the italian side will have no way to do it .
