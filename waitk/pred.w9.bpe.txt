after gradu@@ ating from university student huang , the job found was not as satisfactory as before . in the end , he hung up a name at a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am very satisfied with the current work , and the environment is good . i am now doing more to find a few hours of work .
it is understood that an hour - long work has become a model of experience in the work of some graduates who are working on job - seeking work , and an important way to enhance their skills in work and communication skills .

experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and it is a interference in china 's internal affairs to ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the chinese military threat .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to discuss china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , 15 times directly men@@ tions china 's ta@@ e@@ ine or china 's two phr@@ ases , which are the main and newly emerging big countries , and china is most capable of compe@@ ting with the united states . if the united states does not have anti - us measures , china will develop military bad weapons , and thus it will break the traditional us military superiority in the military
yao yun@@ zhu , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this was the first time that the united states proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the most likely new and most likely big country that would pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report for the first time clearly regards russia as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially a military threat to the so - called china .
rear admir@@ al peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that the " four - year defense review report " was officially submitted on the same day , and us president bush also submitted to the congress a government budget for fiscal 2007 , of which the defense budget was $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the united states added the additional military budget to be added to military actions in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break the $ 500 - billion mark , set a historical high , p@@ ang guang@@ qian said , adding that this is almost equivalent to the total military expenditure of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian held that the us method of creating the threat of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon in creating enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to make more profits for the huge us arms industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in many times in the chinese national defense white paper , said that since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown a down@@ ward trend .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for nearly 10 of the total national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense expenditure in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - 60 of the united states , and the per capita military spending is about one - third of the us military .
the land area of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who 's the military force going beyond the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become oppon@@ ents milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and impl@@ ements a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future threat to any country in the past and at present .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , while more than 100 military bases overseas are deployed in asia alone , and more than 100,000 troops are deployed .
zhu feng , professor of the international relations institute of beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote peace and development in the world .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter ha@@ o@@ huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a new government blueprint has become the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will have a direct impact on the policy direction of all parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of the cabinet , which involves the development of the situation in the future .
who will the prime minister 's post cost ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people outside the cabinet were worried that there might be differences between hamas prime minister 's advisory council and current leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government headed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has intensified international concern .
the united states and israel explicitly expressed their dis@@ approval of a hamas government that holds real power , and threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting independent people is a policy of compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , hamas domestic and foreign leaders who have come to egypt recently decided to elect an independent chairman of the board of directors of the sha@@ h@@ ad@@ an university of egypt j@@ al@@ al ho@@ d@@ in ho - n@@ i as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in hus@@ se@@ in said that the most important thing for the prime minister is to play down hamas 's tough gu@@ y as much as possible , and only by so doing can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
how power is distributed ?
within the organization , the biggest challenge facing hamas is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " shi@@ ji " carried an analysis saying that hamas has drawn people 's attention through social welfare projects , but in governing , it lacks experience and is un@@ related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience in ruling the country .
hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly establishing a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
within fat@@ ah , there are different opinions on whether to join the cabinet , and one faction advocates joining the new government , thereby achieving something . another faction rej@@ ects hamas 's invitation and is willing to act as a positive and p@@ aw@@ n opposition in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ ans toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain over the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a cabinet that is outside the framework of the legislative council .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean and one - sex expert - style government , but the specific name list is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - style government is no longer in the form of a cabinet to ease external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate prime minister and form a cabinet after it takes office on 16 june .
where should armed forces go ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude , and resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and refuse to participate in politics with the gun .
hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces ' problem actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the management of armed forces .
hamas elected to the first congress of the legislative council through democratic and free means , and it has given international recognition that its armed factions , the armed factions , the same as the leg@@ alization of the p@@ act , are to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that all factions should be united as the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a broad response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ ad ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions with lo@@ os@@ ened organizational relations , such as the al-@@ fa@@ ak@@ a marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , and the haw@@ ks of fat@@ ah .
hamas , in charge of forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that manage their own affairs , and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , and civil defense organizations , but the new government 's internal affairs department is under control .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and there is no report yet .

the japanese researchers developed a new highly efficient human kid@@ ney manufacturing system
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the japanese east china sea university developed a bio@@ human kid@@ ney which not only has the same functions as human kid@@ ney trans@@ fers , but also has the functions of re@@ taining the functions of material components , and is small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with the study going deep , it is hop@@ eful to bring good news to kid@@ ney patients .
according to a report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological kid@@ ney mainly consists of two parts , while part of the su@@ c@@ k@@ ling su@@ tr@@ a - waste and water - se@@ wage treatment works of xie gu@@ i@@ jin , while the other part is the re@@ fre@@ shing of blood from the components of the former lieutenant general and the ac@@ id ac@@ id ac@@ id ac@@ id , etc.
the cost of developing the p@@ ath@@ og@@ ens and the tu@@ mors of the people is made by the sil@@ k w@@ ire of the central sky , and the people are made with the inside side of the th@@ os@@ es of the com@@ part@@ ments of the functions of the sub@@ stitu@@ te t@@ le@@ ather .

in the past , the human - made kid@@ ney trans@@ mitted through the differ@@ ing le@@ th@@ al pressure cannot completely remove the le@@ th@@ al waste , and it is not suitable to return the blood of the ac@@ id and other components to the blood .
researchers used the h@@ ills to carry out bio@@ human trans@@ plant experiments , and the center - w@@ alls of human - made kid@@ ney , middle - air w@@ alls used pi@@ g cell@@ s .

these challenges include regional compl@@ em@@ ent@@ arity , vol@@ ati@@ le power shortage , and the situation of electricity supply and demand in some areas will remain tight , and because the mechanism for good coal prices has not yet taken shape , there are still rather serious problems in coal supply , and at the same time , the problem of the down@@ ward quality of electricity and coal has not been effectively controlled , and the steady operation of power generating units will have a serious impact on the steady operation of some power gr@@ i@@ ds
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed , how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and staff members , and ensure the normal production order will become new problems facing us .

south african envoy to china said there were no such organizations in south africa , and the criminal acts of chinese citizens were not present
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china has paid a visit to china from january 13 to 13 , at an exclusive interview with xinhua , ambassador kong k@@ on@@ in said here today that there are no criminal acts of the radical organizations in south africa that are aimed at chinese citizens .
he also said that the south african government would do its utmost to crack down on all forms of crime .
" the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every foreign citizen working in south africa will be able to enjoy the full protection of the local law and citizens , " said v@@ in@@ in .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has shown widespread concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this issue and reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , and the chinese nationals have strengthened unity and friendship between the two countries and cooper@@ ated with the police to crack down on criminal activities .
we express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
" we are very sor@@ ry about this and we also hope the chinese people will believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china , " said fu k@@ ang@@ ning .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the chinese fujian women chen jian@@ qing being killed in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year was arrested by south african police , and the victims ' bel@@ ong@@ ings were recovered .
on the possible impact of the chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ning maintained that these incidents have indeed caused serious damage to trade between the two countries and exchanges in other fields , but in the long run , the impact should not be as big as that of the hor@@ ri@@ ble .
according to the director of the tourism of the south african embassy , the embassy sent more than 2,000 chinese visitors to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its trade status in africa by 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 - billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the continuous killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , chinese tourists to south africa were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
at present , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the towns and villages in south africa are everywhere .
analysts here believe that the rich and poor gap in south africa is large , the unemployment rate is high , and there is no threat of death . therefore , the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they do not know the english , and they have cash at home , it is eas@@ ier for them to become targets of criminal elements ' making money and attacking them .

( winter olympics stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : it is possible that the issue of sending a child may not be settled .
xinhua news agency , tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) - - - news analysis : it is possible that the issue of sending a v@@ in@@ cent to the world will be settled .
xinhua news agency reporter peng ding
although italy has repeatedly ordered that the olympic games be un@@ covered during the winter olympics , athletes who use stimul@@ ants may face the p@@ est disaster , but judging from various situations , such situations are unlikely to occur in this winter olympics .
tur@@ in winter olympics first broke out on 16 june . the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening of the winter olympics was found to have used a drug - free drug card .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that the dispatch of le@@ v@@ a was already out of the winter olympics , and she received a total of 15 - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ als in the winter games .
the international winter - second alliance made a decision on the two - year ban on the distribution of the le@@ av@@ ers on the same day .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes have been found using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games and will be removed from their achievements and be depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the games , but will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants and to use the law - break@@ ers who are unable to stand the sentences of three months to three years .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year - long p@@ aw@@ n , finally reached an agreement after a one - year - long p@@ aw@@ n . both sides agreed to handle the issue of athletes using stimul@@ ants according to italian laws during the winter olympic games .
thanks to the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that during the winter olympics , police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' places . however , the positive - sex athletes will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
some reports say that the italian government 's officials at the tur@@ in winter olympics , per@@ et@@ z , has handed over the d@@ oping incident to the du@@ bl@@ in procuratorial organs .
however , the i@@ oc and pers@@ son have not yet confirmed this .
russian winter - second team medical officer and@@ y dem@@ i@@ re@@ v disclosed at noon on 17 august that le@@ v@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
the united states has been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports officials shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that once the le@@ a is sent back to china , this matter may eventually be un@@ certain .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have never been thoroughly resolved on the issue of anti - d@@ oping agents at the winter olympics . even though italy 's procuratorial organs are really involved in this matter , it is hard to say the result is .
according to the previous judg@@ ments and pen@@ alties imposed by italy on the use of stimul@@ ants by its athletes , the most serious punishment the banned offenders received is no more than the two years of imprisonment suspended implementation .
therefore , senior italian journalist p@@ es@@ el@@ i said that the possibility of sending le@@ a into pris@@ ons is very small , and the most is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a short sp@@ an , it is impossible for the italian police to send le@@ av@@ ers to the foreign countries to serve the sentence .
if the le@@ v@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the ruling , the italian side will have no way to take her .
