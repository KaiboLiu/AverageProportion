prc expert on taiwan 's military threat beijing , 11 mar ( zxs ) -- chinese experts here today criticized the us military threat
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to increase the number of its troops in iraq by a year earlier , according to the report , which was submitted to congress
experts believe that this is a major contribution to china 's normal national defense construction and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the military threat theory of china , which is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new document guiding the defense of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to discuss china 's military strength and the way the united states should adopt to deal with the situation in china , or in china , the two terms used by him , saying that the term was a major and newly emerging power , china has the greatest military competitiveness with the united states , and if the united states does not have any counter@@ measure , china is very likely to develop bad military technology and thus break the traditional military superiority in the united states
professor xu shi@@ quan , a resear@@ cher with the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times , this is the first time in the defense strategy report of the united states proposed that china is the emerging power that may most likely challenge the united states military .
the first time the report clearly defin@@ es the strength of russia and india as strategic ri@@ vals , especially the so - called military threat against china .
guo bo@@ xiong , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the united states president bush also submitted a report on 2007 financial year to congress , which included the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the idea is added to the iraq - afghanistan military operation ,
peng guang@@ qian held that the fabr@@ ication of the us threat of another country reflects the fact that the pentagon repeatedly used the old style of making enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds and to make more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has attended several occasions the military expert deng hong@@ zhou who wrote china 's national defense white papers , saying that with economic development since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditure has declined on the whole during the same period .
official figures show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounted for a decrease of nearly 10 percentage points over the same period of the national financial expenditure .
china 's national defense expenditures in 2005 were 24@@ 4@@ 6@@ 56 5@@ 60 - million yuan , only about one - third of the united states ' , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about one - six@@ ty percent of the united states ' , and the per capita military spending of the servicemen is about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the national territory of the united states and china 's territorial area are r@@ oughly equal , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who is the military force that exceeds the normal defense requirements ? it goes without saying that it is a secret .
" the two sides will continue to strengthen cooperation in the fields of politics , economy , culture , science and technology , and education .
china arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and impl@@ ements a defensive national defense policy .
in the past , china did not have any influence on any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a soldier or a single soldier to other countries , while more than 100 us military bases have been set up overseas , and more than 100,000 troops have been deployed in the asian region alone .
professor xu shi@@ quan of the international relations institute of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

us official : hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter , huang ha@@ o@@ ju
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , how to outline the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the next step of the relevant policy orientation of the parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , the various parties in palestine are stepping up consultations and holding consultations on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that involve the development of the future situation .
the premier 's position has fallen and which family has fallen
after hamas won the right to form the cabinet , some people outside the worry that prime minister hamas may have differences with the current supreme leader , hamas .
moreover , visiting egyptian president hos@@ ni mu@@ barak stressed that hamas - led hamas - led new palestinian government would not recognize israel , and this hard signal also intensified international opposition .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they will not accept a hamas government that has real power , and this will threaten to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and hand over tax to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible policy adjustments , and the possibility of selecting the independent is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international approval , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , including hamas leaders , at home and abroad , decided to elect an independent candidate , j@@ ah@@ mad al-@@ hus@@ ay@@ n , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university school , to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet received response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter who the prime minister 's post comes down , the most crucial thing is that the hamas candidates should be as hard as possible in their hard@@ line color . only by so doing will it be possible to guarantee the success of forming the cabinet .
the power is distributed to the masses
inter@@ n@@ ally , the pressure faced by the hamas cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestine daily newspaper carried an analysis saying that hamas 's use of social welfare projects to gather people 's ang@@ er , but it lacks experience in governance and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of ruling the country .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing ties with fat@@ ah and political partners , jointly forming a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
within fat@@ ah , there are now no views on whether to join the cabinet . one faction stands for participation in the new government , thus getting some things done . the other faction has refused to accept the proposal . the faction is willing to be active opposition parties in the legislative yuan .
informed sources pointed out that under the advice of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee , break away from the party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas also designed a clear - cut and expert - like government , but the specific list of names is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government can also be regarded as a form of cabinet formation that can reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the two sides will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative committee takes office on 16 february .
the armed forces should be the first to be armed to fight .
the weapons in hamas are the main challenge facing the formation of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and it is resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d emphasized on 9 august that armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas has been trying to get elected as the first largest party in the legislative council through democratic and free means , and has enabled the armed factions of hamas , including ma@@ q@@ im@@ ura , to leg@@ alize the matter , to unify it to the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all the factions into the palestinian national authority the people 's army , but did not receive extensive response , and was also attacked by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( ji@@ had ) of palestine .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah has some organizational relations that have lo@@ ose - f@@ itting armed factions , such as the sha@@ ke@@ i marty@@ r brig@@ ades in am@@ o@@ sh@@ ah , and other armed factions .
the hamas that is in charge of forming the cabinet must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are of their own to manage themselves , and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is incl@@ ined to be responsible for security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense organizations under the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and ensure the normal production order will become new problems facing us .
in view of the situation in the power production safety work in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said : it is necessary to further reinforce the basic work of the management of power safety , speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance the ability to deal with emer@@ gen@@ cies , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power plants and power networks , jointly safeguard the safety of power gr@@ i@@ ds , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the safety of the dam , and guarantee the
it is reported that in connection with the new situation in the management of power safety , the electric power regulatory commission will make a revision of and improve the " interim regulations on investigating electric power production accidents " that have already been promulgated . meanwhile , the relevant supporting documents on the safety of the dam of the hy@@ dro@@ electric power station and the protection of the safety of the second system of the power supply system will be successively promulgated this year .
in 2005 , the electricity consumption of china 's entire society will reach 24@@ 6@@ 89 billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ ts , up 13.@@ 4@@ 55 percent from the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand still being tight , the contradiction of coal , electricity , oil , and transportation has become conspicuous , and various power enterprises have earnestly adopted effective measures to strengthen equipment management . there were no major accidents in electricity production in the whole country last year .
the power gr@@ id accident has been reduced by 1@@ 27 times in the same period last year , and the number of equipment accidents has dropped by 13@@ 2 times .
south african ambassador to china says south africa does not have groups of chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to provide aid to south african businessmen in the coming years , according to the chinese government 's policy on the protection of intellectual property rights ( ipr ) , which involves groups of ethnic groups , to the local governments of china and south africa .
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
in his speech , fu said the south african government hopes to cut the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every foreign citizen working in south africa will be given the protection of local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , more than four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another . the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention . overseas chinese should strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we have sent a message to the family members of the victims and expressed their deep@@ est sympathy and condol@@ ences .
" the reason why we do not agree with this is that the chinese people believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the case of the murder of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the south african criminal was arrested in january this year for being suspected of shooting down hong kong businessmen , and the bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victims were recovered .
on the question of the possibility of the chinese citizens ' murder , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed have a very great impact on trade , tourism , and other exchanges between the two countries , but judging from the long - term perspective , the impact should not be large in the impact on the body , but the impact should not be large in the length .
according to the report by n@@ ai@@ sh@@ i , the south african embassy 's tourist commissioner , the embassy provided , in the first 15 days of this year , more than 2,000 chinese nationals were granted vis@@ as to south africa .
according to the official statistics of china , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa by 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , the travel industry believes that the continuous incident of chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 has had a negative impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to south africa 's tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
the chinese living in south africa now have about 200,000 people , and the number of urban villages spread in south africa .
analysts here believe that the wide gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the rampant gun - related crimes in south africa are not de@@ ter@@ red , so the crime rate is still high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash on their bodies and at home , and they are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal activities for making money .

beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) the following is the full text of the speech :
the reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 august that in order to truly curb the occurrence of major and serious accidents , such as coal mines , coal mines are the top priority .
this year , the state administration of coal mine safety and safety will do a good job in the following three aspects :
go on with y@@ ur@@ en to fight a strong gas control battle .
v@@ a@@ j@@ pa@@ yee will first select some of the candidates this year .
if the high gas mine p@@ its are not implemented , they may be used by local authorities according to law .
go on with each other to fight a battle of closing .
we should make public to the public the 5@@ 2@@ 43 cases that have been announced , and the more than 700 coal mine p@@ its recently reported by various localities have been shu@@ t down and closed down .
it is necessary to take the closure as a regular task and to close down those enterprises that poll@@ ute the environment that poll@@ ute the resources and fail to possess safety conditions .
the coal mine safety management should be strengthened .
we must immediately correct the practice of stopping the sli@@ de of state - owned mines by the minority , and guide the establishment of a standardized safety management system for small mines where management is chao@@ tic .
in particular , we must grasp key state - owned coal mines and must not allow excessive strength and extra - large coal mine workers to produce .
this year 's production safety control index requires that the number of deaths of various types in the country has dropped by 3@@ 3.@@ 5 percent over last year , among which coal mines have dropped by 3.@@ 55 percent .
ten people were killed in an extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accident , with a total output value falling by 5@@ 5.@@ 0 percent , of which coal mines fell by 7@@ 7.@@ 0 percent .
these control targets have been assigned to the people 's governments at all levels , and the implementation of the plans at the grass - roots level and enterprises is being carried out in various localities .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9.@@ 86 coal mine accidents across the country were killed , down 0.@@ 77 percent from the same period last year .
however , the number of excep@@ tionally serious accidents involving more than 10 people has risen to its surface , with the number of people killed increasing 6@@ 6.@@ 66 percent over the same period last year .

xinhua news agency reporter gao peng ding
although italy has repeatedly issued orders and orders , the two countries have been found to use stimul@@ ant athletes during the tur@@ in winter olympic games , which may be affected by the ball@@ o@@ ting in j@@ ails , judging from various situations , it is not very likely that this kind of situation will occur in russia , the main corner of the spon@@ sor scand@@ al , the first case of the stimul@@ ant scand@@ al at the current olympic games .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games opened on 16 august , the first case of stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since it opened . the or@@ ang@@ a faction le@@ av@@ ers were found to have used banned drugs cards .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that le@@ v@@ a had been sent out of the winter olympics . she won the winter of the second in the winter olympics . she also won the silver med@@ al in the women 's 15 - km personal champion@@ ship at this winter olympic games .
the world cup two - day league made a decision on sending le@@ an@@ ing teams for two years on the same day .
the i@@ oc has all along stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes using stimul@@ ants , and the law@@ yer who def@@ ects the law is also faced with imprisonment for three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of in@@ curr@@ ing prices , finally reached an agreement this year . both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with italian law to deal with the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants during the winter olympics .
through the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympic games and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the place where the athletes are staying during the winter olympic games . however , the athletes with a positive drug inspection will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the officials of the tur@@ in winter olympic games , per@@ kin@@ s , has sent le@@ v@@ a 's stimul@@ ant incident to the du@@ ur@@ en procuratorial organs .
however , the international olympic committee and the pe@@ st@@ ker himself have not yet confirmed this .
russia 's winter season team team team team team team and@@ y dem@@ to@@ ov revealed at noon on 17 august that le@@ v@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he has served as a member of the anti - d@@ oping agency of the world , and has worked for many years in the chinese sports official . he said that once the le@@ a sent by le@@ a le@@ af to the country , this affair may have been cle@@ ared by a bit .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have made positive efforts to deal with the issue of anti - d@@ oping ag@@ ent in the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organ really did interven@@ e , it is hard to say that the result was too .
according to the previous italian standard of use of stimul@@ ant for its athletes , the number of pen@@ alties received by the banned is just two years ' imprisonment .
therefore , the italian ant@@ a news agency 's senior reporter pi@@ er@@ i said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a to prison was very small , and most of the time was fine .
pi@@ er@@ i also said that although the italian court could have an ab@@ sent trial , it is impossible for the italian police to send le@@ v@@ a back to take the execution .
if we dispatch le@@ op@@ ard to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side also has no way to take it .
