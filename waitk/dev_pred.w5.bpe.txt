( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time staff and college graduates become the main force in hours of work
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau released the latest figures on industrial wages in 2006 , which reached 120 .
according to a relevant expert of the shanghai labor and social security bureau , currently shanghai 's hour workers have already exceeded one million people .
according to a report by the china youth daily , college graduates and part - time personnel are the major component of the work@@ force of the hour .
through the investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time workers , and their proportion is 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 11 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , and they mainly engage in relatively technical work , such as transl@@ ation jobs , the proportion of part - time staff is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7@@ 9 percent , and the number of fit@@ ness personnel is 6@@ 1.@@ 66 percent .
high income is the result of many people who have worked concurrently for hours .
it is learned that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it is hard to expect that the monthly income of the hours ' jobs can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as those in the same positions of the financial mar@@ ried cou@@ p@@ ons , etc.
and satisfy the desire of individuals to expand their knowledge is also a place that attr@@ acts attention from both jobs and jobs .
for instance , when a company is a manager of the department of human resources , mr. gu will take a few hours a week to handle the financial account of a foreign company .
mr ko@@ o considered that the greatest benefit from his part was to keep his knowledge on a new level and to have opportunities to involve another area . of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month also has some attr@@ action .
as some of the jobs for the hours are low , the forms of employment are flexible and free , and they are gradually being favor@@ ed by many graduates who are seeking employment . in the hours of work , 14@@ -@@ 3 percent of the graduates are graduates from colleges and universities .
at the beginning i did n't want to do an hour work , but after i finished a few months , i felt it was better than the fifth day of the ninth dynasty .
after gradu@@ ating from junior college , the job that i found was not as good as expected . finally , i hung my name at a guesthouse and used the pi@@ an@@ o to play the background music .
but i am very satisfied with the work now , and i have a good environment at one hour , 100 yuan , and i am now looking for several hours of work .
it is learned that the work hours have already become a part of the accumul@@ ation of work experience accumulated by some graduates who are seeking jobs , and the key means of improving communication skills in the society .
when the graduates do an hour - long job , they are concentrated in a relatively strong knowledge and technical position , such as a relatively strong transl@@ ation post , a strong sense of age , and a strong performing arts rank of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8@@ 8 % respectively .
the job - related skills required for some hours of work are not high , such as the food promo@@ ter and the driver of the gar@@ b@@ age , etc. , and the unemployed can take up employment through simple training .
the statistics showed that the number of unemployed workers in the hour was 3@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 0 percent , of whom the proportion of the unemployed in the retail category was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the proportion of the cat@@ ering and cat@@ ering industries was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 9 percent . the number of hours of work became an important channel for the employment of the unemployed .

we should establish and improve as soon as possible the system and mechanism that are conducive to innovation , increase scientific and technological input , encourage patent inv@@ en@@ tion , develop famous br@@ ands , speed up the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces , strengthen enterprises ' status as the main body in independent innovation , and continuously increase the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to economic growth .
we should support and encourage the participation of key technological elements in distribution , and establish and improve a statistical system that shows the ability to independently innovate . we should study and formulate policies for supporting independent innovation in finance and government procurement , and form a policy system that encourages independent innovation .
we should cultivate a sense of innovation in the entire society , vigorously advocate the spirit of d@@ aring to innovate and to be bold in competition , and strive to create a good atmosphere in which people of talent come forth in large numbers .
wu bangguo pointed out : the npc has played a vital role in the process of administering the country according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law .

third , we should give play to the characteristics and advantages of the work of the people 's congresses , uphold democratic centr@@ alism , act according to procedures , and decide issues coll@@ ectively .
we should adhere to the mass line , be people - centered , use power for the people , be concerned with the people , and work for the people .

the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to discuss china 's military power and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report directly mentioned 15 times china 's countermeasures or the two terms of china 's ar@@ sen@@ al , and said that it is a major and emerging power , and china has the greatest potential to compete with the united states in military competition . if the united states does not contain anti - system measures , china may develop weapons of bad weapons in the united states , and thus
the chinese academy of military sciences ' world military research department , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times in the past , this is the first time the united states has made a report on the national defense strategy that china is the emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia as india 's g@@ ur@@ an@@ tic strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called " ti@@ p - up " of the so - called china military threat theory .
peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report , " on the same day us president bush also submitted to congress a budget for the fiscal year 2007 , of which the defense budget reached $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the fact that the military action in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us defense budget for 2007 will exceed 500 billion us dollars .
peng guang@@ qian held that the united states has fabr@@ icated the stick of the " theory of the div@@ ine div@@ ine div@@ ine div@@ ine div@@ ine be@@ ings " of the pentagon , and its real purpose is to seek more national defense funds and to fish for more profits for the huge us arms industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert , said : since the 1990 's , as china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national defense expenditures has generally shown a decline .
official statistics show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for nearly 10 percent of the national fiscal expenditure during the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the us 's total national defense spending , which is equivalent to only about one - 60 of the us military 's per capita military spending , and the per - capita military spending of the us military is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the us territory is similar to china 's territory , and military spending is so big .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the 2004 china national defense white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have the sligh@@ test compromise in the past and now , nor would it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and only deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region .
professor zhu feng of the international relations institute of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and trust , and push forward the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century in an all - round way , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ates cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas cabinet seeks breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter : hao huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legisl@@ ature , how to draw the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the peace process the relevant parties in the next step ?
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has also added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to discuss the issue of the formation of the cabinet and the difficulties and sensitive points involved in the future development of the situation .
premier posts spend on which one 's family will be in the prime minister
hamas has been elected as the cabinet , and some people outside the world are worried that hamas may have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , visiting hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ m@@ ash@@ el stressed that the new palestinian government , formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this hard@@ line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government with real power and threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and to pay taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent is a policy of compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international approval , hamas leaders at home and abroad who recently gathered together in egypt decided to elect the chairman of the board of directors of the sha@@ ji@@ ar@@ i islamic university , jam@@ ali ho ha@@ u - ri , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the post of prime minister is spent , the most crucial thing is the choice for the prime minister , so as to less@@ en hamas 's hard - line fla@@ v@@ or and ensure the success of forming the cabinet .
power is distributed under the category of distribution of power ( sub@@ head )
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the " daily " of palestine analyzed that hamas has adopted social welfare programs to gather people , but it has been l@@ acking experience in governing and sharing the same view of the palestinian national liberation movement , which has the experience of ruling the country .
hamas proposed a peace accord with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly established a national coalition government with fat@@ ah , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
there are still many problems within fat@@ ah on whether or not they will join the cabinet , and each faction proposes to participate in the new government , and the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation and is willing to make active opposition parties in the legisl@@ ature .
the informed source pointed out that , under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ines toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold discussions on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework that is divor@@ ced from the party 's cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean - up government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - based government is no longer a form of cabinet forming to alleviate external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the new legisl@@ ature will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form the cabinet within three to five weeks after the new term of office was inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 february .
armed forces should be on the road of development
hamas 's weapons are the most important tasks in forming a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and it resolutely demands that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ ch@@ al stressed on 9 may that armed resistance was the strategic choice of the organization .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the issue of the control of armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , was elected the first major party of the legisl@@ ature , and has been recognized by the international community , making it a leg@@ alized approach of its subordinate armed factions to unify it with the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed to re@@ unify all the armed forces to the palestinian national authority , but it has not received widespread response and has also been subj@@ ected to the attacks by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( al-@@ h@@ ad@@ i ) .
palestine now possesses more than 6@@ 0,000 security organizations , and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relationships with the lo@@ ose - headed armed factions , such as the arm@@ en@@ ian marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , etc.
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of all of these countries and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense and other organizations , which are under the control of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no written statement has been made .

according to a recent report in the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill , which stipulates that american broadcasting operators must completely stop the existing simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 and only send digital signals .

japanese researchers have developed new highly efficient kid@@ ney kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese university of east china has developed a biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney , which not only has the same legal status as human kid@@ ney , but also has the right to retain the material component .
according to the latest report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news , the newly developed biological kid@@ ney is composed of two parts , and part of the st@@ em cell@@ ular from blood and the kid@@ ney sp@@ in , while the other is the kid@@ ney - class fr@@ ig@@ ate from the original ur@@ ine water di@@ ving and the hydr@@ ac@@ id ac@@ id ac@@ id ac@@ id , etc. , the part is a lieutenant general who re@@ uses the blood - born element to re@@ produce the blood - born le@@
the owner of the kid@@ ney and the be@@ ar@@ top of the le@@ gen@@ d is made from the middle air line , and the we@@ t inside the inside is full of the th@@ in - shap@@ ed ir@@ r@@ it@@ ated ur@@ ine , which is capable of dis@@ car@@ ding the di@@ ov@@ en .
this kind of h@@ em@@ p cell@@ s can cause the disease from the my@@ th@@ ic , and the same type of le@@ th@@ al ar@@ id from the past to the blood ac@@ id and return to the blood , and at the same time can also cause the st@@ ap@@ le g@@ au@@ ge and mineral materials that are essential to re@@ enter the blood .

china 's power safety production still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power supervision and administration commission said on the 13@@ th that although the overall safety situation for electricity production in 2005 remains stable , the safety of electricity production is still facing severe challenges .
zhang jun@@ ji@@ u , vice chairman of the national power monitoring commission , said at the fifth meeting of the national electric power safety production committee held here that in 2005 , china 's power production safety was generally stable and successfully fulfilled the summer - day tasks of electric power generation , and actively dealt with the in@@ tru@@ sion of natural disasters , basically ensuring the safety and stability of the power production safety system , significantly reduced the number of accidents and ordinary power gr@@ i@@ ds , and raised the health of power equipment .
however , he pointed out that as the situation of power supply and demand changes and the large number of new generating units are put into operation one after another , the production safety of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seas@@ ide period l@@ acking power shortage will still exist , and power supply and demand in some areas will remain tight , because the ben@@ ign mechanism for coal prices has not yet taken shape , there are still quite a big problem in power supply , and at the same time , the problem of the decline in the quality of electricity coal has not been effectively controlled , and this will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , the weak structure of some power gr@@ i@@
shi yu@@ bo said : as the reform of the power system deep@@ ens , many deep - rooted contradictions will continue to be exposed , how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become new problems facing us .

bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .

analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is wide , the unemployment rate is high , the gun is rampant , and there is no such a threat .
because many chinese do not understand english , there are cash on them and their families , it is more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal syndic@@ ates ' financial attacks .

( winter olympics , d@@ oping agents ) news analysis : the le@@ av@@ a incident may be un@@ settled .
du@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the le@@ ver@@ age of the le@@ av@@ a incident may be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly claimed that the tur@@ in winter olympics was un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ant athletes , they may face the tr@@ au@@ ma of the pris@@ ons , but judging from various circumstances , this situation is not very likely to occur in the first d@@ oping scand@@ al in the winter olympics , the main part of the d@@ oping scand@@ al of the russian federation 's first stimul@@ ant , the two - point scand@@ al of the winter games , the play@@ er of the russian athletes .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games broke the first case of stimul@@ ant since the opening of the games on 16 june . o ' le@@ ver@@ a was un@@ covered and used many banned medicines .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that it had sent pl@@ y@@ wa out of the winter olympics , and she received a winter - time two - kilome@@ ter personal med@@ al in the winter olympics .
the international winter season two league made a special announcement on the same day to ban the ban@@ ds for two years .
the international olympic committee has been laying down that athletes have been un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and will be removed from their achievements and be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes who carry and use stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate and use stimul@@ ant athletes who are still facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of negotiations , finally reached an agreement on price cu@@ ts . both sides agreed to handle the issue of athletes using stimul@@ ants in accordance with the italian law during the winter games .
through the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy has made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympic games , pled@@ ging that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the place of athletes ' presence during the winter olympics , but the dis@@ pens@@ ated athletes will still be subject to investigation by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympic games , per@@ es , has sent le@@ ver@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to du@@ in 's procuratorial organs .
however , the international olympic committee and pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g himself have not yet confirmed the incident .
russia 's winter - time team , and@@ re@@ w dem@@ i@@ re@@ v , revealed at noon on 17 november that the si@@ em@@ ens had left du@@ sh@@ in and returned to china .
he once served as a member of the chinese sports official , who has been working in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and believed that once he sent his le@@ av@@ ers back to china , this incident would eventually be un@@ settled .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have made a great contribution to the anti - d@@ oping ag@@ ent issue at the winter olympic games . even if the italian procuratorial organ really interven@@ es in the matter , it would be difficult to say .
in the past , italy used stimul@@ ant cases to punish athletes in its own country , and the most important punishment given by the banned is just two years of imprisonment suspended .
therefore , the italian ant@@ a news agency senior reporter le@@ i@@ ya said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a to prison is extremely high , and that is , fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be held in a abs@@ ence , italian police could not send le@@ av@@ ers back to prison abroad .
if they send their le@@ av@@ ers to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will not get her to the court .
