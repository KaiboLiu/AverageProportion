( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time workers and graduates of colleges and universities become the main force in h@@ our@@ ly work
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau released on the 6@@ th the latest annual data on wages for labor instruc@@ tors , with 1@@ 80 posts , an increase of 11 over the previous year , with existing salary cu@@ ts rising .
according to the relevant experts of the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , shanghai 's h@@ our@@ ly workers have exceeded 1 million people .
according to a zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao report , college graduates and part - time workers are the main components of the h@@ our@@ ly worker team .
through the survey of nearly 8,000 hours ' work , over half of the work staff are part - time workers , with 5@@ 1.@@ 1@@ 11 percent of them .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , and they mainly engage in technical work , such as transl@@ ation posts , the proportion of part - time staff is as high as 8@@ 1.@@ 7 % , and the number of fit@@ ness products is 6@@ 1.@@ 66 % .
high income is the main reason why many people have worked for hours .
it is learned that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it is also very difficult to get the same result as the sound of interpretation , and the monthly income of the h@@ our@@ ly job can be more than 2,000 yuan , such as the cou@@ p@@ on of con@@ current business , etc.
satis@@ fying individual interests and expanding one 's own knowledge is also a part - time job - see@@ ker .
for instance , when a certain enterprise is the manager of the human resources department , he will take a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign business representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the greatest benefit from the part - time job was to constantly update his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another area . of course , the monthly income of $ 2,000 also has a certain appeal .
as employment thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours of work is low , the forms of work is flexible and free , and many graduates are gradually getting a favor with job see@@ kers , 14 % of h@@ our@@ ly work is graduates from secondary and tertiary institutions in the past three years .
at the beginning i did n't want to do an hour work , but after doing it for a few months , i felt it would be better than the 9 th five - year plan .
after gradu@@ ating from college student huang , the job found was not as satisfactory as it was . finally , he was hang@@ ed at a guesthouse and used pi@@ an@@ o to play the background of music .
but i am quite satisfied with the current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is to find more hours of work .
it is learned that the hours - long work has become a process in which some graduates have accumulated work experience and have improved communication skills in improving their social experiences through job - seeking work .
when the graduates do hour work , they focus on the relatively strong jobs of knowledge and skills , such as those with a strong degree of speci@@ alization , the highly time - oriented performing arts , and the proportion of these graduates is 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
hours of work and part of job skills are not high , such as sales promotion of foo@@ d@@ stuf@@ fs , etc. , unemployed personnel can take up employment after simple training .
the number of hours ' employees was the highest among the unemployed .

china expert : us advoc@@ acy of military threat to china is ground@@ less
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a special investigation group to deal with the " four - year defense review report " which the pentagon recently submitted to congress , saying for the first time that china is one of the emerging powers that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a new contribution to china 's normal national defense construction , and play up the illu@@ sion of china 's military threat is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report directly mentioned 15 occasions the two characteristics of china , namely , the domin@@ ating ones of china , or the two branches of china , and said that as one of the major and emerging powers , one has the greatest potential for conducting military competition with the united states ; if china does not adopt anti - control measures , it is very likely that china
the institute of world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the national defense strategy report that china is the emerging power that may pose the most possible military challenge to the united states .
the mission of this expedi@@ tion report clearly defined russia as china 's emerging strategic ad@@ versary , especially the so - called " expedi@@ ti@@ ous threat theory " .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report , " on the same day , us president bush also submitted to congress the government budget for fiscal 2007 , of which the defense budget for fiscal year 2007 was $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the word " god " is added to the military action to be taken in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break through the $ 500 billion barri@@ er , a new historical high , and peng guang@@ qian said that this is almost the same as the total military expenditure of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the fabr@@ ication of illu@@ sions in other countries by the united states that illu@@ min@@ ate the illu@@ sion of the pentagon has reflected the consistent style of the enemy , which is aimed at gaining more defense funds and gaining more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial groups .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts who have participated in the white paper on china 's national defense , saying that since the 1990 's , as china 's national defense spending has increased , china 's national defense spending has on the whole shown a tendency of decline , as the economy has developed and china 's national defense spending has increased .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for more than half of the country 's fiscal expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending for 2005 is 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , just about one - quarter of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the us is only about one - six@@ ty percent of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the us military is about one - thir@@ ds of that of the us military .
the size of the us territory is r@@ oughly equal to that of china , but the difference between military spending and military spending is so huge . who exactly exceeds the proper defense needs ? this is an und@@ eni@@ able fact .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 white paper on china 's national defense " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future what@@ so@@ ever , nor would it constitute a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries , while the united states has as many as 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas ass@@ ails cabinet for breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthroughs in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 25 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council election , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas implement directly affect the interests of the parties concerned in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that will involve future developments .
premier posts spend time on which one of the leaders
hamas has been elected as the cabinet since hamas won its cabinet . some people are worried that there may be differences between hamas 's top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leaders visiting egypt , al-@@ m@@ ash@@ al , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this strong signal also intensified international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that holds real power and thus threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to select an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to select independent person@@ alities jam@@ ali [ name as transliterated ] , chairman of the board of directors of the sha@@ ji@@ az@@ i islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the prime minister 's post has taken place , the most crucial thing is that the candidate of the prime minister should try his best to dil@@ ute hamas 's hard - line position , only in this way can it guarantee the success of the cabinet .
power , distribution of power
in the internal context , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " the daily " carried an analysis that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
hamas proposed a meeting with fat@@ ah after the election to establish political partn@@ er@@ ships and jointly establish a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not responded positively to this .
at present , whether fat@@ ah will be elected into the cabinet is different , and the faction advocating joining the new government and doing something , and the other faction rej@@ ects hamas 's invitation and is willing to actively engage in the legislative council 's opposition .
the informed source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to form a legislative committee framework that separ@@ ates party - style cabinet from party - style cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technology expert - type government is also not one of the ways to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet for three to five weeks after the inauguration of the new cabinet on 16 february .
armed forces go on
the hamas - led weapons are another major challenge facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and refuse to participate in government .
hamas leader al-@@ ma@@ ha@@ er stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces issue actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the control of the armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , was elected as the first largest party in the legisl@@ ature , and has been recognized internationally , enabling its subordinate armed factions to legi@@ tim@@ ize themselves to the same degree of legi@@ tim@@ acy .
hamas has proposed to unify various factions into palestinian national authority .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations lo@@ ose - se@@ ated armed factions , such as the upper guard of the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , such as the haw@@ ks of the al-@@ fat@@ ah marty@@ rs brigade .
hamas , responsible for forming a cabinet , must consult with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands and distribu@@ te security management powers ration@@ ally .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organs , which are under the control of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and no conclusion has been made so far .

japanese researchers have developed new highly effective human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) japan 's east china sea university researchers have developed a biological - man - made kid@@ ney , which not only has the same level of sub@@ stitu@@ te for human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of re@@ taining material components , and is small and easy to trans@@ plant . with the study in depth , it is expected to bring prosperity to patients with kid@@ ney disease .
according to the latest report by ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news , the newly developed biological cre@@ ut@@ z@@ fel@@ d@@ t consists mainly of two parts , and part of the ear@@ ning d@@ ir@@ ty fre@@ es and water separation portion of the man created kid@@ ney in blood . another part is a lieutenant - general who re@@ returns from ur@@ ine water di@@ ving and kid@@ ney ac@@ id and other factors . the blood pip@@ es are used for the blood pip@@ es that return to the blood .
the goal of creating a kid@@ ney is to wi@@ den the gap between the inside and the inside .
this kind of sk@@ in cell@@ s can make many blood reve@@ al diseases caused by multiple blood , over@@ control the vari@@ ant appe@@ ar@@ ances of the v@@ ant@@ age point of the se@@ g@@ reg@@ ation of material from the tr@@ ac@@ es of am@@ mon@@ ia and the blood , and at the same time , it can also enable the gl@@ uc@@ ose of gl@@ uc@@ ose that is essential for the body to enter the blood again .
the previous human kid@@ ney reli@@ es on the difference in the se@@ epage per@@ sec@@ ution per@@ me@@ ation to fil@@ ter xie waste , and cannot completely remove it and also does not have the ability to return to the blood of am@@ mon@@ ia and other elements .
researchers use the she@@ ep to conduct bi@@ om@@ ed@@ ical kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , and the chinese - made ne@@ ph@@ y@@ st@@ al - making st@@ em cell@@ s used in the pi@@ g 's sk@@ in within the st@@ ore@@ y sil@@ k line .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human kid@@ ney has been able to perform its functions .

china 's power industry safe to meet challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) china 's power industry will be able to meet the demand of the state power industry in 2005 , said a responsible person of the state power regulatory commission ( s@@ sc ) here on tuesday .
zhang zhong@@ yu , vice chairman of the state power regulatory commission , said at the fifth national conference on power safety ( enlarg@@ ed ) that china 's overall power safety production was stable in 2005 , and that it was a success in fulfilling the task of c@@ oping with the summer of the power peak , achieving safety and power supply , actively c@@ oping with the invasion of natural disasters , and basically ensuring the safety and stability of the power system , the safety and production equipment accident in the power industry , and the
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive commissi@@ oning of a large number of new generating units , power safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seas@@ onal vac@@ ation of power vac@@ ation , and power supply and demand in some regions will remain tight ; because of the fact that the coal price mechanism has not yet taken shape , there is still a fairly big problem in power supply , and the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and this will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units ;
shi yu@@ bo said that with the deepening of reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the worker ranks and ensure the normal production order will become new problems facing the party .
in view of the 2006 work of safe production of electric power , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further strengthen the basic work of safe production of power , speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and coordination of power network , jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job in the safety supervision and information building of the dam , strengthen the safety management of power construction , and

in 2005 , the electricity consumption of the entire society in china reached 24@@ 6.@@ 89 billion k@@ w - hour , an increase of 13.@@ 45 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand being still tight , the contradictions between coal , electricity , oil , and transport are conspicuous , all power enterprises have taken effective measures to strengthen the management of equipment . last year , no excep@@ tionally big equipment accident occurred in the production of electricity throughout the country .
74 power gr@@ i@@ ds were affected , 1@@ 27 less than the same period of the previous year , and 4@@ 27 equipment accidents were reported , a decrease of 13@@ 2 compared with the same period of last year .
south african envoy to china says there is no mechanism in which south africa has organized crimes targ@@ eting chinese citizens .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a special administrative region ( sar ) in south africa , the capital of south africa , on tuesday , in an interview with xinhua reporters , said south africa does not have a presence of organizations targ@@ eting chinese citizens .
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu con@@ ing said the south african government hopes to reduce the number of crimes to zero , and hopes that each foreign country working in south africa will receive legal and civil assistance
since 2006 , four senior chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed its concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security , strengthen unity and friendship between overseas chinese and the police to jointly crack down on criminal activities .
but , we told the victims ' families the most sincere sympathy and m@@ our@@ ning .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are very sor@@ ry about this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating each case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the murder of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing on 5 february in south africa , and one suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
in addition , the south african embassy in china revealed that the criminal who was suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year has been arrested by the south african police and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the incident of chinese citizens ' being killed , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents indeed occurred in two countries , and that trade ministers and other areas between the two countries will have a negative impact on trade , tourism , and other areas . looking at the long term , the impact should not be over@@ looked .
the south african embassy 's tourism commissioner , n@@ el@@ son , said the embassy had provided assistance to more than 2,000 chinese people in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , in 2005 , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trading partner in africa .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent from the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 have had a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to south africa 's tourism bureau statistics , in the first half of 2005 , there were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists to south africa , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
the chinese people now living in south africa are about 200,000 people , and they are sc@@ attered in towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the rampant gun flow in south africa have not led to the death penalty , and the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , there are cash on their bodies and at home , and this is more pr@@ one to become targets of financial attack by criminals .

du@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the press analysis : the dispatch of li@@ u@@ a is likely to be a matter of course
xinhua news agency reporter , gao ying ,
although italy has repeatedly claimed that the winter olympics in tur@@ in was un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ant athletes , they may face the preci@@ p@@ itation of the spir@@ al stimul@@ ant . however , judging from various circumstances , this situation is not very likely to occur in the main ac@@ tor scand@@ al of the first ever ho@@ tt@@ est eye in the winter olympics , with the st@@ ag@@ li@@ er series of the st@@ ars of russia , which has been the largest ever since the winter games .
the tur@@ in winter olympics explo@@ ded the first case of stimul@@ ant since its opening on 16 june . o ' u le@@ av@@ a was un@@ covered that there were many un@@ banned drugs .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent le@@ av@@ a out of the winter olympics , and she won two gold med@@ als in the winter games in the world 's two events of the women 's 15 kilometers of individual med@@ als for the winter olympics .
world winter quarter league is to be formed in the same day .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are being investigated for using stimul@@ ant in the olympic games and will be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate stimul@@ ant athletes to def@@ y the law .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of negotiations , finally reached an agreement on negotiations on a price hi@@ ke . both sides agreed to handle the issue of how athletes use stimul@@ ant in accordance with italian laws during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy has made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' places of the games . however , drug prosecu@@ tors who are exhib@@ ited will still be investigated by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympics , executive director per@@ es has sent le@@ av@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to the du@@ bl@@ in prosecu@@ tors .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g have not yet confirmed the matter .
russia 's second winter team doctor and@@ re@@ i mit@@ to@@ ov revealed at noon on 17 july that he had sent le@@ av@@ ers to du@@ sh@@ in and returned to russia .
he has been a member of the chinese sports officials who have worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and believes that once the le@@ av@@ ers are sent back to china , this matter will eventually be settled without preced@@ ent .
shi kang - cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have made a lot of efforts on the issue of the winter olympic games anti - d@@ oping agency . even if italian procuratorial organs really involve themselves in the matter , it is hard to say .
according to previous reports on the stimul@@ ant events that italy had used to show the banned athletes the greatest punishment was only a mon@@ o@@ grap@@ h with two years of prob@@ ation period .
therefore , senior reporter of the italian ant@@ a news agency , p@@ el@@ e , said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a into pris@@ ons is almost small , and most of the prob@@ ability is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court can be tried in a abs@@ ence , the italian police cannot send le@@ av@@ a to the country to take the sentences .
if they send le@@ av@@ ers to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no alternative but to take her .
