experts said that since there is no market for renminbi products at present , the method of avoiding risks for insurance institutions is insufficient , so the tim@@ ing for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , with regard to the allocation of assets , foreign investment should take a certain proportion of the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under greater pressure for re@@ valuation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
the government should also strictly investigate and deal with foreign exchange purchases for overseas investment .

germany to reduce import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the first of its kind was the first time in the history of the chinese people 's political consultative conference ( cppcc ) .
the german minister of education and scientific research , sha wan@@ zhang , said recently that germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign specialized personnel in the law of hong kong , and resolve the problems facing germany in terms of professional talent by increasing the introduction of foreign talents .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany , 15 to 64 - year - old labor force will be reduced year by year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , by 20@@ :@@ germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6 percent as compared with the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ er association have reported that the current labor market has seen professional engine@@ ers running in germany .
the federal labor bureau ( f@@ sd ) said that the unemployment rate in may was 6.@@ 5 percent , compared with the same period last year .
in order to protect its own people 's employment , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
the german " culture " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries may not be reduced to less than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain work and residence permits for germany .
he suggested that this limit be lowered to the stock market .
do not have faith in law , but go through the circle
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates : those professional lawyers who have engaged in legal research and teaching , and those who have high levels of professional skills such as candidates or candidates of equal number , and who apply for legal profession , may be permitted to practi@@ se lawyers after the examination by the judicial administrative department of the state council .
( adopted by china on 28 june )
in law , there are some theories and some departments , and some people are engaged in teaching and research .
over a long period of time , the theoretical circle and the real circles have engaged in literary and artistic phenomena , with some theoretical circles believ@@ ing that the current situation l@@ acked necessary respon@@ ses , but only a mechan@@ ized law l@@ est it in the field , while the troops were in touch with the theoretical circle , and the theoretical guidance was not practical .
with regard to such division of labor , what can the law do is to maintain the situation , not support any party .
however , the provisions in the law on lawyers were found in the fac@@ tual lawyers , but obj@@ ectively they approved the law theory that is higher than the law , and the judg@@ ments made by the legal profession .
in fact , some international organizations , such as law history research and teaching experts , have studied the law of the international legal system . their theories are very different from those of the law .
in this way , the lawyers ' enc@@ um@@ br@@ ation is undoubtedly the result of the dis@@ quali@@ fication of law lawyers , which has an extremely bad tie .
l@@ um@@ p in theory , the com@@ ic faith of experts and experts will often come to an impact on the ruling of the court , and this is also the direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

please do n't let traders get trouble
lia@@ o@@ chun tourism is sl@@ ack@@ ening in the qing dynasty , and it is the largest enjoying the life of natural and social civilization .
however , they travel in the country , and many people have suffered such a kind of worry . when the traders and deal@@ ers of business intermedi@@ ary business are sur@@ ging and ch@@ asing .
whether it is a car or a train , the bus must be accompanied by small traders and some intermedi@@ ary that has no license to go .
it is not selling pe@@ an@@ u@@ t pi@@ g , which is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and even ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the drinking water without license , or even using the intermedi@@ ary license .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some scen@@ ic spots , many things have the same feelings .
before entering the gate , some people come to travel and little grap@@ es .
after entering the door , this situation will be more serious . no matter how good y@@ a@@ xing is , it is also said that it has been r@@ arely seen .
there have been media reports that many foreign tourists who went to xian have praised the temple in xi ' an , but they have more to allow the many small commercial haw@@ kers who have won a p@@ ile to sell them all over .
these include the train of the movement of the wind and the wind , which was originally carried out by localities and which should be civilized , qu@@ iet and harmonious , giving a wid@@ ow environment .
the free flow of traders has sti@@ r@@ red up trouble .
the important thing is that these industries are the window and curr@@ ents for local spiritual civilization construction . they are not only the question of image , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a big and strong tourism industry , you use this kind of chao@@ tic , beautiful , beautiful tourism environment to welcome guests from south to north , who is still willing to come ?
your tourism economy has also achieved economic results .
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , the tourism industry has created a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the northern part of the tian@@ nan region . it should be said that the pressing task is to be met .
wo n't you get a market , but the business of pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ kers should be standardized , and those operating without license must be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities must be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can allow me to feel happy and to work hard to make the people feel happy and to come back .
in one sentence , do not let traders go to trouble .
the decision to re@@ treat and re@@ wards the troops on their own initiative
the construction of neighbor@@ hood in dong@@ cheng district in beijing used electric materials and other articles as tools for the protection of 12 households on their own .
( xin@@ jing bao , 10 july )
i am proud of the improvement in the family life of these people , but i think that there are some articles that reward those who have taken the initiative to re@@ treat and those who have not yet been released .
the deputy director of the neighbor@@ hood office said that the incident of che@@ ating the minimum security guarantee was encouraged to return to the minimum guarantee system .
if this model is an encour@@ agement to other people with low - income workers to get out of their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this to touch those who have long dece@@ ived the low - income groups , they will not be n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the process of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up the housing estates , the more depend@@ able is the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the protection of low - income households in the course of enjoying minimum - income insurance : if they report on the changes in family members and income , report on employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , the relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the troops re@@ treat from the armed forces according to law .
the neighbor@@ hood has also organized a group of people to award the families that have returned to the insurance .
as a first - level government organization , the neighbor@@ hood is responsible for financial appropri@@ ations .
tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the households that withdraw from the minimum guarantee have proven that they have the ability to manage their own income and make their own decisions on their own ; on the other hand , do n't those who apply for minimum security ?
the us military , which is called the life - saving fund , should send char@@ coal in the s@@ now@@ y weather rather than add flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang@@ yi is willing to be service provid@@ er , more importantly
on 10 july , the first nationwide open - minded township , ma xin , in the xing@@ du@@ i town of xin@@ du district , received the fourth democratic election after taking office , with a turn@@ out rate reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at a news conference held with liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a service provid@@ er .
( yesterday 's beijing news )
liu gang@@ yi 's party service members may be more popular than some cadres appointed .
the public opinion poll shows that the most popular vote - appointment system is the one which is mainly decided by ordinary party members and masses , while the latter is mainly composed of higher - level organizations and appointed by the authorities , and the direction of power source has determined that the former must place the responsibility for the people in the first place .
the source of power and the person in charge are the basic criteria for determining how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned whether the democratic movement in taiwan was like a show of democracy .
my view is that with the democracy , the reform method is more important than the ones .
in consideration of the actual situation in the building of democratic politics at the grass - roots level in china , i believe that the promotion of the public was a major breakthrough . democracy is an important component of democracy , and it must not be under@@ estimated to promote the building of democratic politics at the grass - roots level .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed police platform upgraded
the first batch of new - type military aircraft , which came into operation in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , came under the command of the armed forces department of x@@ il@@ ai town , lu yu@@ qing , who was teaching the " psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " , on 18 june . the group was unanimously held by the train@@ ees at the training level .
this is the concrete emb@@ odi@@ ment of the concrete practice of the military cadre in connection with their work posts , and exert efforts to improve the overall quality of the military cadre .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered through investigation and study at the grassroots level that some military cadres had worked for the posts of candidates and concurrently worked in the department , but did not devote their main energy to the armed work .
to this end , they adopted the method of training in a concentrated way and relying on local party school training to regularly train specialized military cadres and to work hard to solve the problems of the lack of knowledge among military cadres .
in light of the central tasks , we should boldly as@@ sign tasks to specialized military cadres , tem@@ per them through working posts , and improve their abilities in working posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for hir@@ ing specialized military cadres by compe@@ ting for jobs , " which clearly stipulates that the head of the armed forces must go to the party committee and no longer serve any other positions .
it has established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging cadres with specialized weapons . for some young cadres who are on the high side who do not meet the needs of the armed forces at the grassroots level , they have promptly read@@ justed and exchanged cadres and promoted comrades with strong work abilities in comprehensive quality .
not long ago , the executive officer of the new century armed forces company limited , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in developing the under@@ water vessels by innov@@ ating and developing the techniques , filled the gap in domestic vessels and was upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
good will begin with
the result of the competition alone is 2 - 2 , which is reasonable and is also something that people can accept . the key lies in the process of the competition .
if iran is 2 - 0 ahead , then b@@ ick@@ le the score , then it will send a feeling of dis@@ simil@@ arity to china , and it will be very long , in the m@@ ood of the ball@@ s , the opposite .
the good will cannot be ended in the end . one old problem can be said .
he often goes through the situation .
this is indeed not something that can happen to him .
however , judging from the competition today , it seems that it is not true .
sun ji@@ hai , hao zhi@@ xiang , hao shi@@ jie , and others k@@ ic@@ ked in europe without saying that li wei and his like were also mar@@ ried for a long time . they had seen many things and said that they had not had any psychological quality .
regre@@ tt@@ ably , he was forced by the iranian team to p@@ lead for a long time , and he was probably transferred to the army .
iran has been behind , and has been replaced by two men . the scene was immediately moved .
the second half of the ball was changed to the name , but the effect was not good .
over@@ coming the old problems that may not be good at the beginning and the end , we must accurately find the root causes of the existing problems .
as long as the problem is accurately identified , the way of changing the existing problem is probably not difficult to find .
fear of being anx@@ ious for a sudden illness and going to hospital .
if things go on like this , the ball@@ s will be k@@ ic@@ ked more , and the old ones will be committed , and the k@@ ick will not be discussed , and the people will be able to get a better play .
