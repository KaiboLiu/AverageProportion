peng guang@@ qian said : the united states fabr@@ icated the threat of other countries by fabr@@ icating the theory that the pentagon has always been making trouble for its enemy style , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds , to re@@ ap more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has participated in many times the military experts written by the white paper on china 's national defense , saying that since the 1990 's , with the economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the overall ratio of china 's financial expenditure in the same period has declined .
official data show that in 2004 , the number of chinese defense spending was 2.@@ 7 percent of the state 's financial expenditure in the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - third of the us , and the national per capita military spending was only about one - 60 percent of the us military spending , and the military spending per capita was about one - third of the us military spending .
the us hom@@ eland and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , and the military expenditure is so huge , and is it a military power that goes beyond the proper defense requirements , and this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said : the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become oppon@@ ents milit@@ arily in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and carries out a defensive national defense policy .
china has been in no way in the past and now , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not conducted any military exercises in any other country , nor has it sent any military force to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and it has only deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia .
professor xu bo@@ dong of the institute of international relations of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

us , china to hold cabinet meeting in new york
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 , hamas has been seeking a breakthrough in the cabinet
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and
palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
hamas to pursue a new policy directly aff@@ ects the peace process of the parties concerned in the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development of the situation .
the chinese government has been working hard to improve the quality of the people .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and people in the outside world were worried that prime minister hamas may have differences with ab@@ b@@ as , the current supreme leader .
moreover , the chinese government , who is visiting egypt , has stressed that hamas is set up by the new palestinian government , that it will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concerns .
the united states and israel clearly expressed their dis@@ approval of a hamas government that holds the power and used this to threaten to stop economic aid to palestine and to refer the taxes to pakistan .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not a good thing for the independent .
it is reported that in order to obtain the international recognition to the maximum , the palestinian leader , who was recently gathered in egypt , decided to choose an independent member of the board of directors of the islamic university , j@@ ay@@ a@@ har@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how much the prime minister 's post is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try as far as possible to weak@@ en the hard - line voice of hamas , and only by so doing can it ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
the chinese government has always been concerned about the situation of the people 's livelihood .
from an internal perspective , hamas 's task of forming a cabinet is to lack sufficient ruling experience .
palestinian " y@@ ass@@ er arafat " said in an analysis that hamas has gathered together in the social welfare project but , in the aspect of governing , it lacks experience and is not in a position to form a coalition with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has its ruling experience .
hamas has been in opposition to fat@@ ah 's plan to establish a political partnership with fat@@ ah and jointly establish a national coalition government since the election , but fat@@ ah has not yet given a positive response .
fat@@ ah 's internal investigation is now on whether or not to enter the cabinet is not the same . the one - party faction advocates taking part in the new government , thus making some achievements . the other faction refused hamas 's invitation .
the source also pointed out that the palestinian - israeli conflict has been escal@@ ating since ab@@ b@@ as persu@@ aded .
even though it is so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of the cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative council framework to dis@@ solve the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is not at all de@@ ter@@ red by a form of cabinet formation aimed at reducing external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian people will be able to hold a referendum on the election of the new legislative council on 16 march . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the chinese government has always been concerned about the situation of the armed forces .
hamas 's weapons are designed to establish a new government , and the new government is facing another thor@@ ny problem .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to take part in politics with the gun .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 april that armed resistance was a strategic choice made by the organization .
armed forces are in fact a leg@@ ality of weapons and the two armed forces ' ownership management .
hamas has been fighting for the palestinian people through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to include all armed forces in the palestinian national authority organizations and the people 's army , but it did not receive a wide response , and it was also strongly condemned by the islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ak@@ ad ) .
the palestinian side has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the great majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations that are lo@@ os@@ ened with the s@@ ag@@ ging relations , such as the marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , the ha@@ y@@ ami marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , and the ha@@ ye@@ t@@ te and so on .
the delegation , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must have a clear exchange of views with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations , and the interior ministry of the new government is returned to the administration .
however , all parties are still discussing the sensitive issue . so far , no document has been published .

according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south africa police have successfully cracked the case of a chinese woman chen jian@@ qing , who was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect was arrested .
at present , police are hun@@ ting another suspect .
in addition , according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminals arrested by south africa police in january this year , and the property of the victims was recovered .
on china 's citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , jiang said that the chinese government has always attached great importance to these incidents .
according to a report by the south african embassy tourism commissioner , the embassy only received 1,@@ 500 tourists from over 2,000 chinese in the first 15 days of this year .
in addition , according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner of china in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached 7@@ 2.@@ 7 - billion us dollars , up 2@@ 3.@@ 7 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the number of people in china who have been killed in successive incidents in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to a report by the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , down by 14.@@ 9@@ percent over the same period last year .
the current population living in south africa is 200,000 , and there are about 20,000 people in the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is too wide , unemployment is high , and fire@@ arms are running rampant , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death penalty , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have a cash with their families , and they are more easily becoming targets of criminal activities in their pursuit of financial attacks .

the state administration of supervision and administration of coal mine safety : controlling the frequent occurrence of major and excep@@ tionally large accidents
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 17 , by w@@ ire ( reporter zheng ) four successive incidents of the mine accident involving more than 100 people occurred one after another . the grim situation of national production safety in the past year has caused the cur@@ bing of coal mines and other major accidents to become the most important task of the national security supervision work this year .
on the 17@@ th , the reporter learned from the state administration of supervision and administration for safe production that the most serious accidents involving coal mines and other coal mines should be effectively checked , and the coal mine is the most important task .
the coal mine safety and the state administration of supervision and inspection will do a good job in the following three things :
the cl@@ ues continue to play the role of the white house in managing the work .
the work of the gas industry should be done before the extr@@ action is taken .
if gao said that the mine would not be allowed to take part in the extr@@ action , it would be necessary to order it to stop production immediately .
the cl@@ ues continue to be done in rectifying and closing down the market .
we should regard the public notice of 5@@ 2@@ 43 of these cases , together with the local authorities ' reports of more than 700 coal p@@ its , a coal mine that has been reported to be dead .
we should regard the closure of the closed down as a regular work , and constantly close down those enterprises that do not have safety conditions for under@@ mining resources .
the number of accidents in coal mines increased .
we should immediately rectify the unhealthy tend@@ encies in the management of large state - owned mines , guide the management of small mines , and establish a standardized safety management system .
in particular , we should focus on key state - owned coal mines and allow over@@ time over@@ time personnel production .
the security production control index this year demands that all kinds of accidents nationwide be down by 3@@ -@@ 3 percent from last year , of which the coal mine has dropped by 3.@@ 5 percent .
once the death tol@@ l was more than 10 people , the number of accidents should be reduced by 55 percent , among which the coal mine should be reduced by 7@@ percent .
these control indic@@ ators have been issued to the people 's governments at various provincial levels , and various localities are now implementing the control measures at various levels .
the total value of the coal mine accidents in china reached 5@@ 9@@ 86 , down 0.@@ 7@@ 9 percent from the same period last year .
however , one time the victims were killed , more than 10 people were on the rise , and 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent of the victims were killed compared with the same period last year .
