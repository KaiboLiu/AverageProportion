i did n't want to work hours at the beginning but after i did a few months , i felt it was better than my ching so@@ y because i had to work on nine n@@ ights later .
after gradu@@ ating from college graduate huang , the job he found was not satisfactory , and he became famous in a hotel . he played a background music with pi@@ an@@ o .
i am very satisfied with my work now , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is to find more work , and keep on coming up with a few hours .
it is understood that the hours of work has become the accumul@@ ation of work experience and skills for some graduates currently seeking to build up work skills , and the enhancement of communication skills in society .
the graduates are mainly concentrated in the fields of knowledge and skilled jobs , such as those with a strong professional transl@@ ation , age - related and professional performing arts , and the proportion is 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8@@ 8 % respectively .
some job - related jobs are not required to be high , such as promo@@ ters of food and clothing , and unemployed personnel can take up posts simply through training .
the figure shows that the number of employees originally employed in the job - related job - related job - related work should be 3@@ 9.@@ 9 percent , of which the proportion of middle - aged unemployed in the retail sector should be as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of employees in the cat@@ ering industry should be 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and the work hours have become an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , and the over@@ r@@ ating of china 's military threat is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is the new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report exp@@ ounds in three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s on china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should deal with , and the report has placed on china 15 times directly , and has put it in two words , china , or china , which is the major and emerging power , and china has the potential to carry out military competition with the united states ; if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop superiority in the field of military technology , thus
zhang ming@@ qing , a resear@@ cher at the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is a newly emerging big country that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly for the first time made russia , china , as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially regarding the so - called china threat theory , paying more attention to , and paying greater attention to ,
major general peng guang@@ qian , a research fellow at the chinese academy of military sciences ,
what is no@@ te@@ worthy is that the " four - year defense review report " was formally submitted , and us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , with the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if , in addition , with the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , creating a new record high , peng guang@@ qian said , adding that this is almost equivalent to that of the military expenditure of other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian held that the united states ' method of creating threats from other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon , which is aimed at winning more national defense funds and creating a huge military industrial complex in the united states .
experts say that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are rather limited .
he has been a military expert who has participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white papers on many occasions , and said that since the 1990 's , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has generally declined .
official data show that , compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures fell nearly 10 percent in the same period .
china 's national defense budget for 2005 will be 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' total , and the per capita military expenditure of the people will be about one - six@@ ty of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the military will be about one - thir@@ ty of that of the us military .
its territorial area and china 's territorial land are r@@ oughly equal , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge , and who 's military strength exceeds the proper defense needs . this goes without saying , because the proportion of its territorial land is quite large .
peng guang@@ qian said :
wang guang@@ ya , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china will firmly take the road of peaceful development and implement a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have , and will not , future threats against any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it dispatched a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas cabinet seeks breakthrough in creating new cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas cabinet has been formed to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 27 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the international community at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the peace process the relevant parties will follow in their policy direction .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach an agreement on the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of a cabinet that involve future developments .
the year after the premier 's post , which family ?
after hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some people are worried that hamas 's supreme prime minister may have a dispute with the current leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas would not recognize israel , and this tough signal also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they do not accept a hamas government that holds the power in the hands of the palestinian people , and have threatened to stop providing economic aid to palestine and passing on taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent person is a compromise strategy .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as far as possible , hamas and chinese and foreign leaders who gathered in egypt recently decided to select the chairman of the board of directors of the saudi islamic university , jam@@ ali al-@@ hu@@ da , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who 's the prime minister 's post , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister 's candidate should play down as much as possible the hard@@ lin@@ er color of hamas , and only by so doing can it ensure the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
from an internal perspective , the greatest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
an article in the palestinian daily newspaper said in an analysis that through the social welfare project , hamas has gathered in people 's favor , but in terms of governance it lacks experience and has cooper@@ ated with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of being in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly formed a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah 's internal opinion is different whether to enter the cabinet . one faction is advocating participation in the new government , and the other side is willing to make a show of active opposition in the legisl@@ ature , rather than being invited by hamas .
the source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain on the allocation of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to separate the organization of a legislative committee from the party 's cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts - type government has also lost its role as a form of cabinet that can reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative committee takes office on 16 june , nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where will armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have taken a very tough stance , resolutely demanding that hamas give up violence and refuse to enter the government with a gun .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el stressed on 9 may that armed resistance was a bound@@ en land of the organization .
the armed forces issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas was elected first secretary of the international community through democracy and freedom , and it has allowed its subordinate armed factions to be leg@@ alized by the same means as leg@@ alizing its subordinate armed factions .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions and armed forces as the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a broad response and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some subordinate armed factions that have lo@@ ose relations , such as the cemeter@@ y of marty@@ rs of ak@@ sa , and the oce@@ ans of fat@@ ah .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of each individual 's own free will and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te the security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as was pur@@ pos@@ ely in charge of security and intelligence , police , and civil defense departments , but the new government 's ministry of interior was under the control of the ministry of interior .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further document .
china issues first polar study report
beijing , february 10 ( xinhua ) the chinese state oce@@ an@@ ic administration ( so@@ a ) recently issued the " 2005 china polar inspection report " , which is the first time in more than 20 years since china began its polar scientific research activities .
the " report " comprehensively reflects the achievements made by china in polar scientific research activities in 2005 , namely , the study of polar science and technology for polar research and the extreme protection of natural resources .
according to the " report , " the " report " shows that at 22@@ :@@ 15 on 9 january 2005 ( beijing time ) , the chinese ant@@ arc@@ tic ice inspection team successfully landed on the peak of the ant@@ arc@@ tic ic@@ ec@@ ap on the high plate@@ au of the ant@@ arc@@ tic ocean , and it was also examined at 3@@ :@@ 15 on 18 january ( beijing time ) , which determined the elev@@ ation of the highest position of the ch@@ ic@@ om was 4@@ 0@@ 9@@ 3 meters .
under the increasingly fierce international polar examination arena , chinese people are strongly determined and fe@@ ar@@ less . they are bold in opening up new fields . they have first conducted research on the highest point of the southern region of ice and high oil and achieved success at one stro@@ ke , thus realizing another dream of mankind in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui , director of the state oce@@ an@@ ic administration , said :
the " report " shows that on 24 march 2005 , china 's 21 st ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion team successfully completed its mission and returned to shanghai . the inspection tour lasted 15@@ 1 days and 26@@ ,@@ 500 n@@ au@@ tical miles .
on 18 november of the same year , the 22 nd chinese ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion left shanghai and went to the ant@@ arc@@ tic zhong@@ shan station to conduct scientific research activities . it will leave the zhong@@ shan station before the end of february 2006 and return to shanghai via australia .
because it was the first time china issued the polar inspection report , the 2005 china polar inspection report also made a comprehensive assessment of the development of china 's polar research cause , which started in the early 1980 s .
according to the " report , " china formally joined the " ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty " in 198@@ 3 and became a member of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty . after the treaty was signed , the council of directors of the nan polar science research council of the southern pol@@ e of ant@@ arc@@ tic was among the most influential international organizations on ant@@ arc@@ tic affairs .
in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee and won the right to speak and make policy decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 - odd years , china 's polar land inspection has grown from scr@@ at@@ ch , and has initially developed into a sym@@ ph@@ ony of science research system , namely , the establishment of the southern ant@@ arc@@ tic chang@@ cheng station in february 198@@ 5 , the central ant@@ arc@@ tic station in february 1989 , and the north pol@@ e station in july 200@@ 9 , and the southern pol@@ e station which began to undertake since 1994 .
according to the " report , " by the end of 2005 , china has organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific inspections and two oce@@ an@@ ic surveys , and the northern oce@@ an@@ ic ships , with the north pol@@ y@@ co@@ tic sea as the p@@ ath@@ way platform , were carrying two groups of inspection of the north pol@@ e . so far , more than 3,000 people have been inspected by sea in the whole country , and they have personally inspected the north pol@@ e in person .
at present , we are building the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and china 's first inland ant@@ arc@@ tic research station , and we are conducting feasibility study and investigation work .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar research cause has already occupied a position in the world 's polar study , but compared with other major polar countries , there is still a big gap between us and we must catch up with our heads and make our decisions accordingly .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui revealed that china will publish an polar inspection report every year .

the us super cas@@ s , the newly - formed american ol@@ ive soccer play@@ er , has become a hot play@@ er in the us broadcasting industry to welcome the high - ranking tv match .
according to a recent financial times report , the us congress recently passed a bill to stipul@@ ate that american broadcasting industry personnel must stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 and only send digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of us television programs has already had a clear timetable .

this problem has taken a turn for the better this year .
according to the forecast by the us consumer electronics association , digital television sets will sell their sales in the united states this year for the first time exceeding the traditional tv sets , and 8@@ 5 percent of the digital tv sets are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) japanese researchers have developed a bi@@ olog@@ ically - made kid@@ ney that not only has the same characteristics as human kid@@ ney , but also has the same characteristics of having material content .
according to a recent report by " ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i industrial news , " the newly developed bi@@ o - man - made kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and part is used to fil@@ ter xie waste and water from blood , and the other part is used to make a return of blood for the blood of the ser@@ bs and other parts of the country , which are used to return to the blood cell@@ s to make a fresh blood cell@@ s .
the people made a living of a mon@@ key and a mon@@ ke@@ ys , and made of a sil@@ k line , and made a small le@@ op@@ ard of people , and filled with sub@@ stitu@@ te for sub@@ stitu@@ te for d@@ econ@@ tam@@ ination .
this type of sk@@ in cell@@ s can make the ox@@ yg@@ en , which can be analyzed through multiple blood trans@@ fu@@ sion , is subject to the distribution of material for di@@ agn@@ os@@ tic hydr@@ og@@ ic ac@@ id and return to blood , and at the same time , it can also enable the cell@@ s necessary for body to enter the blood cell@@ s and other materials .
in the past , human - made kid@@ ney reli@@ es on the difference of penetr@@ ating pressure to replace waste , and it cannot be completely removed , and it does not have the function of making cell@@ s such as hydr@@ og@@ en comp@@ ound return to blood .
the researchers used the she@@ ep to carry out experiments on trans@@ plant of biological human - made kid@@ ney , and the sk@@ in cell@@ s used in pi@@ g sk@@ in inside the sil@@ ver@@ str@@ al line of man - made kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that man - made kid@@ ney had been able to function .
at present , they are developing bi@@ o - human - made kid@@ ney for the use of human d@@ ir@@ ty cell@@ s and will start clin@@ ical research after veri@@ fying their safety .

russian winter play@@ er and@@ re@@ w de mit@@ t@@ ov revealed at noon on 17 august that li@@ on@@ ai@@ ka had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
the world anti - d@@ oping agency has been working for many years , said s@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official who has been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency , and once the country is sent back to china , the matter may be settled without a shad@@ ow .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never stopped cooperation on the issue of anti - rise sp@@ read@@ s in the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organ really involves , it is hard to say .
according to the previous reports of the use of stimul@@ ants by italian athletes , the maximum penalty given to the banned is the two years ' imprisonment suspended period .
therefore , senior journalist of italian news italian news agency italian news agency p@@ el@@ er@@ el@@ i said that the possibility of sending len@@ a to prison was too minor , and was fined at most .
p@@ el@@ er@@ i also said that although the italian court could hold a def@@ aul@@ t trial , the italian police could not send len@@ in@@ o back to china to take cust@@ o@@ dy and serve the sentence .
