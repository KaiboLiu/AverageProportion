after gradu@@ ating from university student huang , the job he found was not as satisfactory . finally , he hung a name at a guesthouse and used a pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am quite satisfied with my work at present , and my environment is 100 yuan per hour . now i have to find a few hours of work .
it is understood that working in an hour has become the work experience of some graduates who are engaged in job - seeking work , experience - training , and skills enhancement of communication skills in society .
the graduates ' work hours are mainly concentrated in knowledge and skills , such as professional and technical transl@@ ation posts .
some of the h@@ our@@ ly workers do not have high requirements for their skills , such as food promotion personnel , etc. , and the unemployed personnel can start their jobs after simple training .
the data show that among the h@@ our@@ ly workers , 3@@ 9@@ ,000 were unemployed , including the ratio of the unemployed in retail , 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of restaurants and cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 77 percent . the number of hours worked has become an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

experts believe that this is an un@@ justi@@ fied accus@@ ation of china 's normal national defense construction and a play on china 's military threat theory , which is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report exp@@ ounds china 's military power and the countermeasures the united states should take , and the report has directly mentioned china 's ant@@ ag@@ on@@ istic or pol@@ ite language .
yao yun@@ zhu , a resear@@ cher at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions before , and that this is the first time that the strategic report on national defense that china is the emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's nu@@ ke china as a new strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called china military threat theory , for the first time . it gives more attention to the pol@@ arity of the so - called china military threat theory .
major general peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences ,
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that the " four - year defense review report " was formally submitted to congress on the same day , us president bush also submitted the 2007 fiscal year 's government budget , including the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if plus the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for 2007 will be revised up@@ wards by 500 billion dollars .
peng guang@@ qian said that the us method of creating the nu@@ isance theory of others ' mis@@ mat@@ ches the pentagon 's consistent style of creating enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds and to re@@ ap more profits for the m@@ am@@ mo@@ th industrial group of the united states .
experts said that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has been a military expert in the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white paper on many occasions , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of china 's national defense expenditures in the same period has shown a down@@ ward trend .
official data show that , compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending has dropped by nearly 10 percentage points over the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - quarter that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about one - sixth of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the servicemen is about one - third of that of the us military .
the hom@@ eland of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who exactly is the military power that exceeds the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ad@@ vers@@ aries in the military field in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
in the past , china has no such thing in the future , and will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed over 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet formation
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas wants to form a cabinet to make breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , aug@@ . 17 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) , after winning the election of the legisl@@ ature , has been working out a new government blueprint , becoming the focus of international attention .
what new policies will hamas pursue will directly affect the corresponding policy orientation of all parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of the cabinet that involve the development of the situation in the future .
who will the premier 's post have left ?
after hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some people were worried that hamas prime minister might have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader mar@@ sh@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this strong signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they do not accept a hamas government that has real power , and have threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and selecting the independent is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the international recognition as much as possible , hamas leaders at home and abroad who gathered in egypt recently decided to choose independent ak@@ ash@@ i k@@ aw@@ ah@@ ar , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of israel , as the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that the most crucial thing is that the prime minister candidate should play down hamas 's strong fla@@ v@@ or as much as possible , and only by so doing can the formation of the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
an analysis by the palestinian daily times says that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and has no relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has its governing experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political relations with fat@@ ah and jointly forming a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
within fat@@ ah , there are different opinions on whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction advocates joining the new government and then getting something done . another faction has refused hamas , and is willing to do something active in the legisl@@ ature committee .
the informed source pointed out that , through ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to break away from the party aff@@ iliation outside the framework of the legislative council .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and p@@ ure expert government , but the specific name is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - style government cannot be missed as a form of cabinet that reli@@ es on external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , after the new legislative yuan takes office on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course to follow in arming ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to participate in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud stressed on 9 may that armed resistance is the strategic choice of that organization .
the question of armed forces actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the management of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected the first largest political party in the legislative council through democratic and free means , and the armed factions of hamas li@@ ed to leg@@ alize its aff@@ ili@@ ated parties were brought into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to re@@ unify all the armed forces into the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a broad response , and was also opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ack ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions , such as the al-@@ qa@@ ed@@ a marty@@ rs brigade , which are under lo@@ ose aff@@ ili@@ ations , such as the al-@@ z@@ aw@@ az@@ a marty@@ rs brigade .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach a consensus with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own administration and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , and civil defense organs , while the new government 's interior ministry will be managed in a centralized manner .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further report has been made .

south african envoy to china said that there is no such thing as the organization of crimes committed by chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china has been working with china to promote the development of bilateral relations , said minister of foreign affairs and trade of z@@ amb@@ ia , who is in charge of the south african embassy in china , in an interview with xinhua on the 13@@ th .
he also said that the south african government will do its best to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
he said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every foreigners working in south africa will enjoy the safety of life and property of their citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side on this matter and reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of safety and prevention , and the chinese nationals resi@@ ding in south africa should strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' family members .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry for this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the murder of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese fujian woman , on february 5 in south africa , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspect who was suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen was arrested by south african police in january this year and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the possible impact of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning believed that these incidents indeed would have a great impact on the trade between the two countries as well as exchanges in other fields . some negative impacts on exchanges in other fields , but from a long - term point of view , the impact should not be considered as big ones .
according to the south african embassy tourism commissioner n@@ el@@ son , the embassy has provided more than 2,000 chinese to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's position as the biggest trading partner of africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the continuous killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , there were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
currently , about 200,000 chinese living in south africa are living in the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of guns , and the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english and have cash at home , it is more likely that they will become targets of the criminal elements ' financial attacks .

state administration of safety supervision : cur@@ bing frequent accidents in coal mines and other major accidents top priority this year
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) four incidents occurred one after another in which more than 100 people were killed in the mine accident , and the grim situation in national production safety has caused serious accidents in coal mines and other extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents to occur in this year 's national safety supervision work .
the reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 july that it is necessary to effectively check the frequent occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents , such as coal mines , and the most important ones .
the state administration of safety supervision will handle the following three matters well this year :
b@@ ach@@ et continues to fight a war of tackling tough problems .
gas treatment this year must be based on the fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous field that has been taken before it is pic@@ ked up .
if the gas mine does not take out the cu@@ sh@@ ion of the mine before it is pic@@ ked up , it must order it to stop production immediately according to law .
b@@ ow continues to fight a tough battle in rectification and closing .
we must make public the 5@@ 2@@ 43 of the areas that have been publicly announced , plus the 700 - plus mine p@@ its recently reported recently in various places , a point that has been closed down .
we should regard closing down as a regular task and continuously close down those mines that undermine the natural resources environment and do not have safety conditions .
to@@ x@@ ic@@ ab strengthened basic management .
it is necessary to immediately correct pl@@ ague control of a small number of large state - owned mines and establish a standardized safety management system .
in particular , we must not allow super - intensity coal mines with excessive intensity to produce personnel .
this year 's production safety control index demands that the number of deaths of various types of accidents in the country dropped by 3 % over last year , of which coal mines dropped by 3.5 % .
the extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents that killed more than 10 people should have been reduced by 5 percent , of which coal mines dropped by 7 percent .
these control quotas have been assigned to provincial - level people 's governments , and all localities are moving to grassroots units and enterprises in different levels .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9@@ 86 min@@ ers were killed in coal mine accidents , a drop of 0.@@ 77 percent over the same period last year .

tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the incident of sending a ser@@ a may be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency , beijing , april 28 ,
although italy repeatedly ordered that during the tur@@ in winter olympics , the number of athletes who were found to be using stimul@@ ants may be faced with the cat@@ astr@@ oph@@ ic mor@@ es , judging from various circumstances , this situation could not possibly occur in the first case of stimul@@ ant scand@@ al in the first ever rising olympics , and the two russian winter champ@@ ion au@@ re@@ a , au@@ di@@ pp@@ a , who is the principal play@@ er of the russian winter in@@ do .
tur@@ in winter olympics explo@@ ded on the 16@@ th , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since its opening , and o@@ '@@ le@@ av@@ a was found to have used many banned drugs .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that it had sent lev@@ a out of the winter olympics , and that the 15 - kilome@@ ter individual women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter personal games she had received in this winter olympics have also been taken away .
the international winter mon@@ ument alliance made a decision on the same day to me@@ te out punishment for the two years of the ban .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes who have been found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games will be dis@@ qualified and not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the act of carrying and using stimul@@ ants is a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate stimul@@ ants , and the person who def@@ ends the law will face three months to three years ' imprisonment .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , through a year of qu@@ ag@@ m@@ ire , finally reached an agreement after suffering a price back to each other . both sides agreed to handle the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants according to italian law during the current winter olympics .
thanks to the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not go into the olympic village to search for the place where the athletes are staying . however , athletes who have been tested positive for the medic@@ ation will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government mon@@ itors the tur@@ in winter olympics , per@@ si@@ an k@@ r@@ ish@@ nan , has handed over the d@@ oping incident that sent lev@@ a to the du@@ an procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g themselves have not yet confirmed the matter .
russian winter team doctor and@@ em@@ i@@ y@@ ov revealed at noon on the 17@@ th that he had sent his family to tur@@ in and return to china .
he has been a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and is of the view that once he sent lev@@ a back to china , this matter may eventually be too weak .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have never been treated with regard to the issue of the fight against the promotion of the winter olympics . even the italian procuratorial organs have been able to get involved in this matter , it is hard to say .
in the past , the italian government imposed fines on the use of stimul@@ ant in its own athletes , and the most serious punishment for the banned is still the he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual implementation of two years ' imprisonment in mat@@ ches .
therefore , italian ant@@ a news agency senior reporter pi@@ er@@ i said that the possibility of sending le@@ v@@ a into pris@@ ons is somewhat isolated and the top is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could have a hearing of the abs@@ ence , the italian police could not possibly have taken away the release of le@@ v@@ a from abroad to serve the sentence .
if the le@@ av@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will have no way to take it .
