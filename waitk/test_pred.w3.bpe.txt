wang yuan :
experts believe that insurance is a long - term cause of internal stock market capit@@ alization .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " regulations on management of offshore investment of insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago . insurance funds have a broader space for use in the capital market .
china 's chief executive officer of sam@@ sung corporation liu le@@ fei believes that the appreciation of the renminbi and the good direction of the domestic capital market , and the insurance institutions will not invest in foreign countries through investment in the short term , and this also means that insurance has not diverted domestic stock funds in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same view .
experts said that as there is no longer any bin@@ ding renminbi products market at present , the insurance institutions are not suffici@@ ently capable of avoiding risks , and the tim@@ ing for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not yet mature .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long term , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should be in a certain proportion in the overall conf@@ ig@@ uration of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for the purchase of foreign exchange , under the present circumstances , it is necessary to deal with it with cau@@ tion .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly criticized judicial intervention in the election the taiwan " judicial yuan " den@@ ies and wants to interpre@@ t it .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 3 c chen shui - bian on the 30@@ th questi@@ oned judicial personnel on the island who attempted to get involved in the election of a leader in the taiwan region .
taiwan 's judicial court , administrative organ , gao zhi@@ qiang , said on the same day that the performance of judges on the island is not in line with what chen shui - bian said , and he also asked chen shui - bian to explain his views .
according to a report by taiwan 's " sh@@ ao pao , " chen shui - bian doub@@ ted on 30 june the relationship between the att@@ or@@ ney and the investig@@ ator and the investig@@ ator , and because of political or election considerations , he interven@@ ed in and even attempted to influence the campaign activities of candidates of various parties , saying he hoped that such phenomena would not exist in taiwan , but that it might be very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's doubts , the president of taiwan 's judicial yuan li@@ e@@ ying , said nothing about the response from secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un , gao qi , gao jing@@ zhi , speaking from the judicial affairs college .
gao jin@@ chi said : taiwan 's fundamental law and the code of conduct of judges h@@ arr@@ i ming should declare that judges should go beyond the party , be prohibited from taking part in political party activities , and that judges are very careful in observing the relevant restrictions . judges believe that the court of justice is good .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that kaohsiung could not stop the trial of justice judge zhang sheng@@ xi at k@@ ai@@ da school a few years ago because of the party col@@ ors in the course , which was decided by a self - discipline committee formed by judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to join the dpp , because he took up the election because of his job disputes .

germany to lower professional talent import thre@@ sh@@ old
the first day of the year of the chinese new year , the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla )
germany 's education and scientific research minister s@@ wan said a few days ago that germany should lower the requirement of " proced@@ ural law " for introducing foreign professionals and increase the import of foreign professionals to solve the problems facing german professionals .
according to o@@ ec@@ d reports , germany went to bin@@ jie 15 - 64 years old , and the number of labor@@ ers will decline year after year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , until 20@@ :@@ 00 , german labor force will be reduced by 60 percent .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ er association reported that in germany , the current labor market , professional engine@@ ers , professional technicians , are bigger than professional engine@@ ers .
the labor department said that the number of unemployed workers in the german labor market was up to 1@@ -@@ 1 percent in may , and that the technicians were suppl@@ ying about 9@@ ,@@ 600 people .
germany , in order to protect its own people 's employment , has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for bringing in foreign talent .
germany 's " sh@@ ao law " stipulates that non - eu countries ' professionals do not have to compete with each other in germany for a job of 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os or a residence permit .
sha wan suggested that the limit be lowered to bin@@ ding to bin@@ ding to bin@@ ding euro .
do not have super@@ sti@@ tion , but theoretical circles
the draft law recently submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval stipulates : the people who have engaged in legal research , such as teaching chu , have the characteristics of a high level of speci@@ alization , such as those in the same rank of barr@@ ist@@ ers or once , and who apply for lawyers ' practi@@ sing , shall be approved by the state council 's judicial administration for examination and approval and be allowed to practice their profession .
( 28 june " zhong@@ guo bao " )
there are laws governing differ@@ enti@@ ation between theory and practice , and there are different reasons for the former , mainly including legal teaching and research work , and other matters related to the chao@@ tic situation , and the latter is more practical actions such as legal consultancy and legal services .
for a long time , there has been theoretical innovations and practice in the theoretical field , but there is a cl@@ ash between man and man , and theoretical circles believe that there is no need for essential matters in the field of practical work , and only mechan@@ ics are for@@ b@@ idden in legal matters , but there is no need for theoretical guidance in respect of critic@@ isms of the theory of truth , and it is difficult to guide practice with theory .
the division of labor has a great bearing on the division of labor and the legal system that can be done in this way .
however , the " law of lawyers " contains some strang@@ e things , but it obj@@ ectively recogn@@ izes the legal profession . it is more important to meet the judgment of law than the legal profession .
in fact , some experts engaged in legal system and international laws purely for theoretical research and teaching , such as the law of the legal system , have deep theoretical knowledge with legal facts .
in this way , bao zhi@@ jun 's system of lawyers will undoubtedly serve the purpose of conf@@ using legal qualifications , creating a situation of extremely bad mou@@ th .
it is necessary to cherish super@@ sti@@ tion in theoretical circles , such as experts ' argu@@ ments and argu@@ ments , which will affect or even rej@@ ect court decisions , and also directly manif@@ est such super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain 's plan to reduce terrorist attacks
the first ever international conference on the development of the western region of china was held in london on 5 july .
the british government , after attacking terrorism , launched a attack from the highest level to the severe sh@@ ock level , which indicated that the terrorist attacks in britain will soon occur , but the attack is still very likely .
at present , british police have shif@@ ted the scope of investigation to india and australia .
as the eight arrested terrorists attacked the police , they were all working in the medical system , and the government will investigate and deal with the background of the migr@@ ants who had entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly sh@@ un in britain 's public health system workers are working overseas .
prime minister sh@@ aw also called for efforts to analyze the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or related organizations will be asked to provide information about the background of the disease .
do n't let traders be ti@@ red .
there are many scen@@ ic spots in the red , but there is no sl@@ ack@@ ening in the effort to relax the effort , and to the greatest extent enjo@@ yment of natural and social civilization .
however , the number of people who travel in china has encountered such a kind of worries , but in the process of being attacked by shop traders and intermedi@@ ary business , there is no need to go after it .
whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , the main driver of the car , must meet with small businessmen and some intermedi@@ ary without a license , and k@@ no@@ c@@ k in .
it is not selling out of wood c@@ akes , which is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many non - certi@@ fication to introduce the food , the sh@@ ining of food , and even the false not@@ arization .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and it 's very difficult to get a good impression of being ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some aspects of the wind , many of them have the same feelings .
the door was not opened for tourists .
after entering the door , this situation will become more serious , and the good y@@ a@@ xing is also su@@ sc@@ ep@@ tible to un@@ certain@@ ty .
some media have reported that the number of foreign tourists who went to xi@@ '@@ an was unprecedented for xi@@ '@@ an 's ancient heritage , but they were very dis@@ appointed with the many du@@ st@@ y pe@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ lers who were allowed to sell them everywhere .
including the lan@@ es of ancient enc@@ y@@ cl@@ op@@ edi@@ a , the original was born out of the country , and the localities where there were good , civilized , orderly , qu@@ iet , and harmonious , which gave birth to a relaxed , relaxed , relaxed , and harmonious environment .
the freedom of the retail trade , the conf@@ used things that have not been done in the heart of the matter , obj@@ ectively under@@ min@@ ed these kinds of public order , resulting in pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it also provided some conditions and opportunities for the sake of reference .
the important thing is that these rare enc@@ ils are the wind@@ ows of the spiritual civilization construction in hong kong , but they are cl@@ oned with the whole picture . they are not just an image issue but also an impact on the economic development in the loc@@ ality .
just think , if you want to be a strong tourist industry , you use such a m@@ ess of tourism environment to welcome south - to - north visitors , who will come and who will dare come ?
your tourism economy is also a way to achieve efficiency .
with the peak tourist season , the traffic in the northern part of tian@@ nan prefecture has created a civilized tourist environment . it should be said that the pressing task is to create a civilized tourist environment .
do n't worry about the market , the business behavior of pe@@ d@@ d@@ ler pe@@ d@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be standardized , and the business without verification should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can enable the whole family to feel happy and to go home with great vigor .
in a word , do n't tie the business to trouble .
prc : j@@ f@@ j@@ b article critici@@ zes us for taking the initiative in re@@ taining others
the beijing dong@@ cheng district , jian@@ jun , used to distribu@@ te electronic products and other items , as a voluntary retirement scheme for 12 low - income households .
( " xin@@ jing bao " on 10 july )
the auth@@ or has made a lot of jo@@ y for the improvement of the living conditions of these families , but also talked about the practice of re@@ war@@ ding the gos@@ p@@ el with flu@@ sh re@@ wards .
ji@@ ao@@ qi street office deputy director said : in response to the problem of che@@ ating low - income insurance , we encourage the withdrawal of the private insurance company on our own initiative , and set examples for other low - income households .
this example , if it is to encourage other low - income insurance personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament , it is indeed worth advocating . if we want to use this to express those people who have long been dece@@ ived by low - income insurance for a long time , we cannot avoid being chil@@ dish .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and sor@@ ting out low - income households , what is more reli@@ ant on is the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the protection of low - income households in the course of enjoying the minimum guarantee : if they promptly inform the family personnel and income situation , report on the employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination , the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the preser@@ vation of ancient grain is a long - term plan .
the street has a special meaning for re@@ war@@ ding families , and who will be bur@@ ied ?
as a first - level government organization , the street 's expenditures are borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
the tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be used ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal of low - income families prov@@ es that they have possess@@ ed certain ability to govern themselves , but on the other hand , there is not a lack of sufficient ability to apply for minimum - income insurance .
the rescue team , called life - saving money , should send out relief in the snow rather than adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that china is willing to serve the people .
on 10 july , the first public opinion poll in zhen@@ bao village , which was selected for the first time in the country , was held in q@@ am@@ an@@ si district , z@@ ou zhen@@ lan , from z@@ ang@@ yi , for the fourth time after taking office , to accept the cl@@ arity rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at a news conference with liu gang@@ yi , liu said that liu made himself a member of the service , but was still a bit strang@@ e .
( the " xin jing bao " yesterday )
liu gang@@ yi 's family service was a sh@@ ock , probably a little bit more than the appointment system of cadres , and it was more true to tell people from the truth .
the public - nom@@ inated system is the most important thing in comparison to the system of public promotion , and the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members , while the latter is mainly appointed by the higher - level organization , and the source of power has decided that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for who are the key to determining how the person to be elected should carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned such a her@@ es@@ y as democracy , but also like a cl@@ ay of democracy .
my view is that there is such a tie between democracy and the effort , which is better than that .
considering the reality of china 's grassroots democratic political construction and the current situation , i believe that the public - to - public elections are a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of democracy , which is not to be under@@ estimated in promoting grassroots democratic political construction .

pa@@ al is the first chinese female president in indian history . if she was elected , she would become the first female president in india .
pa@@ vel is the ruling national congress party candidate , sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ at is from the opposition party people 's party .
because of the opposition party 's support in the presidential election , the media and the people all stood up , and the possibility of par@@ agu@@ ay 's election was rather large .
the 72 - year - old pal@@ an@@ qu@@ ia is the head of the l@@ ach@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ te state .
she , a law@@ yer , entered the congress , experienced abundant experience , and was very experienced in the long term of office of the head of the state of la@@ stan@@ th@@ en@@ th@@ al . she was per@@ ple@@ xed by the government .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , which is the main theme of many cultural education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why par@@ ag@@ un became a candidate was because she had been blin@@ dly l@@ acking in the hearts of s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi , chairman of the national congress party of india .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
par@@ agu@@ ay was criticized by a large number of female voters , and female voters believed p@@ ai@@ jie would play a leading role in india 's women 's image , which had a serious dis@@ crimin@@ atory concept of fem@@ al@@ es , in an effort to enhance the status of fem@@ al@@ es .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federation state and the president is the nom@@ inal head of state and head of state of the country , and does not represent any party organization , and more importantly it is a symb@@ ol .

a few years ago , with the personnel , the family of this brigade was able to get a little more st@@ uck in some of its buildings , which was un@@ authorized . as a result , the staff and soldiers were in a difficult place in housing .
the brigade also made several clari@@ fications , and all of them were unable to get through because of various obstacles , making this issue an old , big , and difficult one .
only by d@@ aring to fight for truth can we solve problems without being able to solve problems .
the new leading body of the party committee reached a consensus , and principal leaders personally started to tackle all ir@@ regular@@ ities and occupation of houses .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces department upgraded the quality of special - force cadres
the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] held a national defense education meeting in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province on 18 june , in which cadres from jing@@ jiang city got together , the " winning inform@@ ati@@ zed wars " psychological warfare tu@@ tor@@ ial given by minister lu yu@@ qing , who was in charge of " fighting and winning inform@@ ati@@ zed wars " , received the unanim@@ ous support of train@@ ees .
this is a unique techni@@ que that can be applied to cadres by the armed forces department in light of the actual situation in their posts , and which aims to improve the comprehensive quality of specialized - duty cadres .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during the investigation and study at the grassroots level that some cadres with special skills were former length , standing concurrently , and do not put the main energy into the armed work .
for this reason , they adopted training methods with concentrated efforts to train cadres in party schools and relying on local training in order to carry out training for specialized military cadres at regular inter@@ vals , and made efforts to resolve such problems as the narr@@ owing of the knowledge level of military cadres and the lack of professional quality .
in connection with the central task , he boldly assigned special - purpose cadres to carry out tasks , but instead , he tried to improve his ability to serve at the post .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " program of competitive appointment of specialized military cadres , " clearly stipul@@ ating that the minister of the armed forces must go to the party committee of the ji@@ ao@@ zi group and no longer over@@ take other duties .
the chinese military has established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres , and has made great efforts to prevent cadres from adap@@ ting to the armed forces at the grassroots level from being over@@ anx@@ ious to meet the needs of the armed forces at the grassroots level , and to promptly adjust and exchange them , and to promote comrades with strong overall quality and strong ability in work .
not long ago , the armed forces department of xin@@ century , ltd . , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technology detachment in making innovations and developing under@@ water vessels , filled up domestic affairs , and was upgraded to the director of the company 's department of defense .
the good start needs to be good
the results of the competition alone show that the two - to - two score is reasonable , and it is acceptable to you , and the key is the process of the competition , how much regre@@ tful it is .
if iran is 2 - 0 , then the nuclear team will score the same , then it will bring a bit more profound feelings to china .
good can never be good at the beginning , but one can say that it is a problem .
he often comes out in the face of the situation .
this is indeed a rare phenomenon that can not do good at the end of the battle .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that the competition is not as good as that .
sun ji@@ hai , sh@@ ao qi@@ an@@ xiang , sh@@ ao qi@@ an@@ zhi , and others were k@@ ic@@ king in europe without saying that li wei and others were also the veteran players who had been through s@@ and and . they saw many things and saw many things , and they could not have any problem in psychological quality .
this regre@@ tt@@ able fact was forced to p@@ our the iranian team , and the reason was probably because of the lin@@ e@@ up of the troops .
iran 's team was in a backward position for two men , and the scene was immediately confirmed .
the second half of the match also changed three names , but the effect was not good .
we should overcome the tendency of being good at the beginning and not good at the end , and we must find the root of the problem .
as long as the problems are accurately solved , the method of re@@ moving the existing problems will probably not be difficult to find .
fear of emergency , and take medicine in a rush .
if we continue this way , we can only play more games , old problems will also commit off@@ enses , and we cannot talk about k@@ ic@@ king a further round .
