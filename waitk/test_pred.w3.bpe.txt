experts believe that the chinese people 's insurance industry will not f@@ ade off domestic stock funds in a short period of time .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by zhong@@ guo securities , a few days ago , the " provisional measures for managing investment in the outside of the insurance fund " was promulgated , and insurance funds have a broader space for applying the capital market .
china national share@@ holding company 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei said that the rmb appreciation and the domestic capital market are good , and insurance institutions will not go abroad to purchase foreign exchange through large - scale purchasing of foreign exchange . this also impl@@ ies that insurance companies will not diver@@ t domestic stock funds in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same views .
experts said that as there is no evidence of renminbi products in the market , insurance institutions are not suffici@@ ently capable of avoiding risks , so the opportunity of large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said that for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should be in a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for the purchase of foreign exchange , under the current circumstances , it is necessary to be cautious in dealing with the issue .

german education and scientific research minister sh@@ v@@ wan said a few days ago that germany should lower the " bin@@ ding law " lim@@ iting the introduction of foreign professional personnel and increase the number of qualified personnel from foreign countries through increasing the introduction of foreign talent .

there are many theoretical circles and many people who are concerned about the truth . the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , such as the case of b@@ og@@ us violations , and the latter are engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , legal consultation , legal services , and other specific actions .

however , the " law of lawyers " contains a few cl@@ ues to the legal system , but obj@@ ectively it recogn@@ izes the law , and it is necessary to judge the law , which is more important than the law .
in fact , some people who are engaged in the theory of the legal system , such as the international law , have been studying theories and teaching , and their theories are very deep and also related to the legal practice .
in this way , the system of lawyers is no doubt a legal profession .
we should not be blin@@ dly conf@@ used about theories , such as experts ' argu@@ ments and argu@@ ments , which may affect or even rej@@ ect court verdic@@ ts , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

do n't let traders take trouble
you have a won@@ der@@ ful idea of a few days , but you have to enjoy the most natural things and social civilization .
however , the number of people who travel in china has all suffered such a kind of worry , and they are being detained by traders and intermedi@@ ary business to ch@@ ase them .
both the automobile and the train , the b@@ ar , always suffer small business and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ ary ti@@ ps , and they are b@@ og@@ ged down .
not be@@ tr@@ aying the f@@ ame and bur@@ ns , it is selling newspapers and magaz@@ ines , and many other ir@@ regular@@ ities have introduced the food , be@@ ver@@ ages , and even fal@@ si@@ fied evidence .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and it 's very difficult to achieve a ben@@ evol@@ ent trend .
in some storms , many people have the same feelings .
the door was not open , but some people came to visit the temple and sh@@ ine things .
after entering the gate , this situation will become more serious , and the good y@@ a@@ xing will also be sti@@ r@@ red up and l@@ acked .
there were media reports that the many foreign tourists who went to xi@@ '@@ an , who were not at all surpris@@ ed at the mon@@ uments of xi@@ '@@ an , but they were very dis@@ pleased with the fact that more children were allowed to sell .
these include the old fol@@ k songs like the old fol@@ k , the true of the story , the old style of civilization , the qu@@ int@@ essence of the my@@ ster@@ ious environment , and the present situation .
the freedom of expression of traders has sti@@ r@@ red up trouble , and obj@@ ectively , it has damaged these public order . it has formed a chain of pollution and environmental pollution , and it also provides a way to compl@@ ement the conditions and opportunities for them .
the important thing is that these are the main wind@@ ows for the building of spiritual civilization in hong kong , and they are all - se@@ al , and the damage is not only an issue of image , but also an impact on the development of the local economy .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to make a big effort to strengthen tourism , you will use such a dis@@ ordered environment to welcome the visitors from south to north , who will come , who will dare come ?
your tourist economy is also an important factor in achieving returns .
with the surge of the peak tourist season , the number of tourists from the northern part of the country has been a civilized tourist environment , and it should be said that the moment of the moment is ri@@ pe .
you do n't have a market , and the business behavior of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers should be standardized , and those who do not have a license should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment can enable one to feel happy and to make one 's life prosperous and re@@ invigor@@ ate again .

the construction of the main streets in dong@@ cheng district in beijing is aimed at distribu@@ ting electric products , such as electric sh@@ ell , to award the low - security families that have taken the initiative to protect the interests of 12 households .
( " xin@@ jing bao " on 10 july )
this writ@@ er has made a lot of contributions to the improvement of the lives of these families , but he has also made a f@@ are@@ well statement to those who have made contributions to the re@@ treat .
the building of roads in jian@@ bao county is a deputy director of the office of the ji@@ ao@@ ji@@ ao district people 's procuratorate , saying that encouraging people to volun@@ t@@ arily surr@@ ender their insurance is an example for other low - income households .
this example , if we encourage other low - income insurance personnel to shake off their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if we want to use this to drive those people who have long been dece@@ ived by che@@ ating on low - income insurance , we cannot avoid being n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the process of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up the in@@ sec@@ t , we have more depend@@ ence on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the role of low - income insurance companies in enjoying the minimum insurance benefits : they should inform their families and income changes in a timely manner , report on the employment situation , and receive regular re@@ examination , while the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is not easy to keep things in line with the law .
the street has a negative impact on the family re@@ education , which is the case , ?
as a first - level government organization , the street 's expenditures are borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
however , the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be used ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - interest families prov@@ es that they have a certain degree of self - supporting ability and that on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - income insurance is not still present ?
the rescue team , known as the life - saving money , should provide relief in snow - covered areas rather than adding flowers to the sky .
liu said that china is willing to serve the people , and that this is more difficult .

during the interview with liu con@@ stan@@ i , liu con@@ ferred on him as a " strang@@ e person " .
( the " xin jing bao " yesterday )
liu con@@ te@@ stant , who is a her@@ o , may be more n@@ ice than some appointed cadres who have been under the system , and this is more true , and makes people feel more in@@ different .
public promotion , direct election , and the most important thing in the system of appointment are the main candidates of ordinary party members who decide the source of power , the latter are mainly appointed by the higher level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for who is the key to what is the decision to carry out the work ?
some people questi@@ oned such a pan@@ ic , even more like a cl@@ en@@ bu@@ ter@@ ol of democracy .
my view is that there is such a strang@@ e form of democracy , which is better than not .
considering the reality of the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i think that public promotion of elections is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this matter , and it is of no need to be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

analysts pointed out that the reason why pal@@ an@@ es became a candidate was because she always kept her from the post of chairman of the congress party of india s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long been under control of the ruling congress party .
p@@ ad@@ u@@ a was warmly welcomed by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believed that p@@ ag@@ er would play a role in dis@@ crimin@@ ating against the serious image of indian women , and in improving the status of women .

modern military uni@@ form three functions
first , the ability to identify .

in the world , more than 100 countries ' armies , although the military uni@@ form uses are basically the same , no two countries ' armed forces have the uni@@ form .

a few years ago , with the personnel 's efforts , the family building of this group was un@@ law@@ fully occupied , which made the cadres in the service difficult to housing . the officers and men have a greater opinion on this .
the group also paid several real time rooms , and all of them were unable to keep up with all kinds of resistance , making this issue an old and difficult problem .
you can only have a br@@ ave time to go through the truth and be unable to solve the difficult problems that cannot be solved .
the new term of party committee has reached a consensus , with the principal leaders personally leading the way to thoroughly sort out all problems concerning the occupation of houses in violation of regulations .
on the one hand , they have made a f@@ us@@ s about things , hoping that relevant personnel will keep them in mind , while on the other hand , they talk about the relevant policies and regulations governing the army 's self - defense building , the need to pay for the army 's self - financing , and the need to apply the economic housing system , and show the firm determination and principled stand of the party committee .
we must resolutely and thoroughly investigate and deal with some other cases of housing which are not willing to withdraw from the housing system , and party committees and institutions that are in their own units in a timely manner and take corresponding measures to promote their active coordination with the work of the troops .

beijing , 13 jul ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- yang ba@@ oc@@ un , reporter liu xin@@ xin reporting : the pla units will be successively replaced with seven uni@@ form from 1 august .
tonight , the chinese military web site specially invited military professionals to meet with the requirements of the military supplies department , deputy director of the armament bureau , chen jun , and senior engine@@ er of the research institute for military equipment , the " military uni@@ form " , su yang , as the guest of the chinese military , and the background and development process of the new military uni@@ form , which was born by ne@@ tiz@@ ens both inside and outside the military , have ev@@ o@@ ked re@@ perc@@ ussions among the ne@@ tiz@@
the two guests are the 07 - style military uni@@ form design , which is directly related to the military .
speaking about the new uni@@ form changes , they introduced that the military uni@@ form of the 07 - style military uni@@ form is a special combat form that has been renov@@ ated on the basis of the 97 - model military uni@@ form , and seven aspects , including the series of bin@@ ding form@@ ats , etc. , of the uni@@ form .
the seven - style military uni@@ form is the most important characteristic of the military uni@@ form system .
the two guests also exchanged views on the varie@@ ties of new uni@@ form , the pan@@ dem@@ ic of the mir@@ r@@ or , and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
this time , the chinese military online is jointly developed by the chinese military net and the chinese new wave .
the jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform has raised the quality of specialized military cadres .
the pla daily said : the chinese government has made solemn representations to the us government on 18 june regarding the issue of " falungong " in the armed forces department of x@@ ai@@ jiang city , jiangsu province .
this is a mir@@ ac@@ le of the history of our country 's armed forces departments in con@@ junction with their own posts , and it is a new change in the comprehensive quality of specialized military cadres .
in early this year , the party committee of the ministry of national defense discovered during the investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some special military cadres have been in office for long , and have been in office and have not devoted their main energy to the work of arming the troops .
to this end , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating on training soldiers , relying on local party schools to train them , and so on , to carry out regular training for specialized military cadres , and to focus on resolving the issue of the lack of knowledge and quality of professional military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly give special - arms cadres a task of pressing forward , and enhance their ability to work in the post through training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on the bidding for posts by specialized military cadres " and clearly stipulated that the minister of the armed forces must go to the leading body of the party committee and stop other posts .
the establishment of a system for readjusting and exchanging cadres with specialized arms has greatly made some young cadres un@@ fit to the work of arming the grassroots , promptly read@@ justed and exchanged , and made important contributions to promoting and using comrades with strong abilities in overall quality .
not long ago , the new century c@@ os@@ mon@@ au@@ t company , ltd . , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technology deta@@ ch@@ ments in making innovations and development , and filled the gap between domestic affairs and the upgrading of the company 's armed forces department .
good will first be good .
the results of the competition alone are 2 - 2 , which is reasonable , and also a mir@@ ac@@ le that can be accepted , and the key is the competition process , and how much regre@@ ts it .
if iran 's team 2 - 0 , then the match will be equ@@ ated , that will cause a s@@ ens@@ ation for china , it will definitely be different , and the morale of the team will be very long .
good can never be good at the end , but can be said to be a problem with a man .
you often feel like a situation .
this is indeed a m@@ ess that cannot be cu@@ red and a c@@ ure .
however , from what we have seen from today 's competition , it seems that it is not the end .
sun ji@@ hai , sun xiang@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ay@@ i , zheng zhi , and others were k@@ ic@@ king in europe , but li feng and others did not say that li wei and others were old men who had gone through the s@@ and@@ y field . they saw a wide variety of views and said that their psychological quality would not be a problem .
this is a tr@@ ick that the iranian team was forced to calm , because it was probably because the re@@ deployment would be a bit too difficult .
iran 's team is in a backward situation , and they are on the scene immediately .
after the second half of the match , three people changed their f@@ ame , but the effect was not good .
we should overcome the difficulties that are not easy to do and to end the problems , and we must find the root cause of problems .
as long as the problem is found , the method of eliminating the problem is probably not difficult to find .
they are afraid that they will take a doctor in a rush .
if this is the case , the k@@ ick will be a little more competition , and the old problem will be broken , and the k@@ ick that everyone is looking forward to is further mentioned .

the specific method of the cooperation zone is to break down the division of the establishment of the unit and to design@@ ate a brigade - level unit at the level of a brigade in a relatively concentrated area of small , remote , and directly - aff@@ ili@@ ated unit to conduct education on the theme of education . the units under different aff@@ ili@@ ations are close to the group meetings or discussions on the system of sharing one 's distance .
