" the report directly mentioned 15 times that china has followed or is the ' figure ' in 92 china , and said that " hu@@ e " as a major and emerging great power , china has the greatest potential to conduct military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have any counter - measures , china may develop military technology to break the traditional us
the chinese academy of military sciences ' world military research department , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time that the united states has put forward in the national defense strategy report that china may possibly become a rising power that will possibly pose a military challenge to the united states .
hello .
the chinese academy of military sciences research fellow peng guang@@ qian said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the same day , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the government budget for the fiscal year 2007 , with the defense budget reaching $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if you do n't add to the fact that the military action in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us budget for fiscal 2007 will break through the $ 500 - billion mark , setting a historical record , and the " pol@@ e " in the budget for fiscal 2007 , peng guang@@ qian said , adding that this is almost equivalent to the total and inter@@ dependent relationship among all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us fabr@@ icated the theory of the threat of other countries reflected the lon@@ ely created by the pentagon , and the real purpose of this is to win more national defense funds and provide the greatest possible benefit for the huge arms industry group in the united states .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has attended many times the white paper on china 's national defense , and said that the military has been developing rapidly since the 1990 s , with the economic development , but the proportion of the national defense spending in the country 's fiscal expenditure has been on the decline .
official data show that the number of people who are chinese national defense spending in 2004 is about 60 percent of the state 's financial expenditure for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - third of the us 's , and the per capita national military spending was about one - six@@ ty percent of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending was about one - 30 of the us military .
hello , america 's land area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , and the difference in military spending is such a huge one , who is the military power that goes beyond the proper defense needs ?
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has been unable to make any further concessions in the past and now , he said .
so far , china has not conducted any military exercises in any other country or has not sent any military bases to other countries . however , the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and only has deployed more than 10@@ 0,000 troops in asia .
professor chen shi@@ bao of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels to enhance understanding and mutual trust and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote world peace and development .

us , dprk sign agreement on forming cabinet
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks to break through cabinet
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the victory in the legislative council election , how to draw a blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
hamas to launch a new policy directly aff@@ ects the peace process the next step of the relevant policy direction of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian sides are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the future development of the situation and the sensitive point .
the chinese people have always been the masters of the country and the people
hamas win@@ s right to form cabinet , some people in the world worry that hamas may hold a dialogue with the current leader .
moreover , the arab league , which is visiting egypt , has stressed that the hamas - led palestinian government will not recognize israel , and this tough signal will also intensify the international community 's worries .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the real power , and threatened to cut off its economic aid to palestine and pass taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible tactics .
according to reports , to maxim@@ ize the ac@@ cred@@ itation , a few days ago , hamas domestic and foreign leaders , in egypt , decided to select the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how much the post is spent , the most crucial thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should try his utmost to play down the hard - line style of hamas , and only thus can it ensure the success of the cabinet .
the chinese people have a common understanding on how to alloc@@ ate power
in terms of internal affairs , the hamas cabinet is faced with the greatest challenge of l@@ acking sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily news carried a analysis saying that hamas has been able to gather together with the people through social welfare projects , but in the aspect of its ruling power , it lacks experience and is not in agreement with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
hamas has been putting forward a plan to establish a political partner with fat@@ ah after the election , jointly establishing a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not yet given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah 's internal affairs are currently still in dispute over whether to enter the cabinet . one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus doing something . the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make a positive opposition in the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that , under the persu@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah have also agreed to hold consultations on the distribution of their cabinet positions .
in addition , another approach is to organize a legislative committee framework to break away from the party 's attribu@@ tes .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean expert type of government , but the specific name list is unknown .
in view of the fact that the us and israeli attitude and the technical expert - type government are also unable to be lost as a form of cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian national authority will hold a meeting on the nomination of the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative council takes office on 16 february .
the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] will not change the way to arm the people 's liberation army [ pla ]
hamas 's arms are to form a new government , and the other thor@@ ny problem is that it is facing .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude , and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its gun - related participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ fa@@ hd stressed on 9 may that armed resistance was a strategic choice made by the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas 's new government , which is elected by the legislative council through democratic and free means , has been recognized internationally , and the armed faction under it has li@@ ke@@ wise legi@@ tim@@ ized the way to leg@@ alize it in the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed to put the armed forces of various factions into a fl@@ ag@@ pol@@ e for the people , but it has not received extensive response and has also been strongly opposed by the islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ hamas ) .
the palestinian - israeli conflict , which has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , is mostly from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations that are lo@@ ose , and some armed factions , such as the hu@@ e temple of the arm@@ en@@ ia marty@@ rs , etc.
the government is responsible for forming a cabinet , and it must hold consultations with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate the security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as has the intention to be in charge of security , intelligence , police , civil defense , and other organs , and the interior ministry of the new government is in charge of this .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further documents have been issued .

he also said that the south african government will do its utmost to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
mr g@@ ord@@ on said that the south african government hopes to reduce its criminal rate to zero , and hopes that every one of the foreigners working in south africa will have the safety of their lives and property .
since the beginning of 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another . the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
chinese foreign ministry has already made solemn representations with south africa and reminded chinese citizens resi@@ ding in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention . the overseas chinese compatriots should strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
hello , we are going to express our most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims .
mr g@@ ord@@ on said , " we feel sor@@ ry for this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china . "
according to chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of chen jian@@ qing , a fujian woman in china , on 5 february , in south africa , and one suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are hun@@ ting for another suspect .
in addition , according to the south african embassy in china , the number of criminal suspects suspected of gun@@ ning down hong kong businessmen in january this year has been arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims has been recovered .
on china 's citizens ' killing , li peng said : the chinese government has always attached great importance to these incidents .
according to the information given by the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy has provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists with tourist permits to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
in addition , according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its status as the largest trade partner of africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , an increase of 2@@ 33 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the number of accidents in china that occurred successively in 2004 has a serious impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 3@@ 31 , down 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent from the same period last year .
currently , the number of chinese living in south africa is about 200,000 , and the number of urban villages in south africa is spread all over south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor in south africa is wide , unemployment is high , guns are rampant , and there is no death penalty deterr@@ ence , so the crime rate remains high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have good cash and are more easily become the tools for making money for criminal elements .

the government has always stipulated that athletes should be able to take the initiative to make use of stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and be stri@@ pped of their quali@@ fication , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to the italian law , the carrying and using stimul@@ ants by an athle@@ te is a crime , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ants , and to def@@ y the law by the example of the law , and to be sentenced to three months ' imprisonment .
on december 20 , the i@@ oc and the italian government signed a stat@@ ute entitled " open price " after a year of hard work , and both sides agreed to set up a " standard " for athletes to use stimul@@ ants in the current winter olympics .

he has been a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , said that once she sent her to china , it is possible that she will leave behind the scenes in this matter .
" the government will continue to work with the italian government to promote the development of the national economy , " said shi guangsheng , director of the international olympic committee ( i@@ oc ) and the italian government , in the winter olympics , " it is not going to solve this problem , " said shi .
according to previous estimates of the use of stimul@@ ants by italian athletes , the number of illegal immigrants received by the banned was also only a " pol@@ e " in the two years of imprisonment slowly carried out .
therefore , the italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ ans@@ a news senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending len@@ a to prison was unexpected , and at most it was fine .
p@@ el@@ i@@ el@@ e added that although the italian court could try its abs@@ ence , the italian police could not go abroad to send len@@ a back to serve the sentence .
