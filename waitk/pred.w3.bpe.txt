experts believe that this is a serious test of china 's normal national defense construction , and it is a great emb@@ arr@@ ass@@ ment of china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guidelines document of the pentagon .
the report , which is a long - term 92 page , exp@@ ounds on the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , on 15 occasions , directly mention the two important issues of china 's in@@ ner@@ most and china 's gl@@ os@@ s@@ ary , saying that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest military potential to compete with the united states . if the united states does not contain any countermeasures , china will very likely break its traditional military superiority and thus break
the world military science research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said : although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time the united states has made known its position on the united states in its defense strategy report , and it is the emerging power that may pose military challenges to the united states .
the first report clearly says that russia 's nuclear weapons program is a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china military threat theory .
the chinese academy of military sciences ( cas@@ s ) has a long history of development .
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report , " the us government and the us government have also submitted a budget report to congress for the fiscal year 2007 , of which the national defense budget is $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the fact that you have been engaged in military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states fabr@@ icated the fall@@ acies of the united states of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of the pentagon creating enemies in the united states . its real purpose is to strive for more national defense expenses and to gain more profits for the us large arms industrial group .
experts said that the huge military spending of the united states is a rather limited proportion of china 's national defense spending .
he has been involved in the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has been writing the chinese national defense white paper on many occasions , said : along with economic development in the 199@@ 0s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure for the same period has been on the whole dec@@ lining trend .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the figure was higher than in 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for nearly 10 percentage points of the national financial expenditure for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was $ 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only equivalent to one - 14 of the us military expenditure , and the per capita military spending of the people was only about one - tenth of the us military spending , and the per capita military spending of the servicemen was approximately 1 / 30 of the us military spending .
the us territory and china 's territory are mainly large . the military spending is not so big . in the end , who is the military power that has gone beyond the legitimate defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china 's association for arms control and disarmament research director teng jian@@ q@@ un said : the united states should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction situation . china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become oppon@@ ents milit@@ arily in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense white paper " says : china firmly pursu@@ es the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and present did not have any doubt on any country .
so far , china has not established diplomatic military bases in any other country , nor has it sent out a military p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , while more than 100 us military bases overseas have been established in asia alone .
professor zhang xu@@ e@@ qin of the international relations institute of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , increase mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century to jointly promote world peace and development .

china 's top legisl@@ ature to form cabinet
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has decided to form a cabinet to break through
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang hao huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , and how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
hamas will pursue what new policy will directly affect the peace process the next step of the policy direction of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are intensifying consultations to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the chinese premier 's position has become a hot topic of discussion .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some people in the outside world are worried that hamas 's prime minister would probably have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the visiting egyptian president ab@@ du@@ l - ra@@ h@@ man al-@@ ass@@ ad stressed that the new palestinian government , which is formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that has the power to grasp , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , elec@@ ting independent people to be a policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , the hamas , which is gathering in egypt , recently decided to select independent mus@@ l@@ im school chairman j@@ a@@ hy@@ ar al@@ ab@@ ar , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not been taken up by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian government has no choice but to take over the post of prime minister , and the most crucial thing is to weak@@ en hamas 's strong sense of power , and that only by so doing will it be possible to ensure its success .
the chinese government has always attached importance to the issue of how to distribu@@ te power .
in terms of internal affairs , the most serious challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " y@@ days " analy@@ zes that hamas has been concentr@@ ating on social welfare projects , but it has been l@@ acking experience in governing and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
hamas has proposed a " peace agreement " with fat@@ ah after the election , and has jointly established a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah 's internal problems are now on the rise .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward the new government .
even though hamas and fat@@ ah have also reached a consensus on the distribution of cabinet posts ,
in addition , the other way is to establish a framework of the legislative affairs commission , which is beyond the jurisdiction of the ruling party .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is also not out of the form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet on 16 june . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three weeks .
the chinese armed forces should follow the path of what course to follow .
the weapons in hamas are the main tasks facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir emphasized on 9 july that armed resistance is the strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has been trying to win the election of the first major party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom , and this has made the armed factions of hamas , which are subordinate to it , to the same extent , to the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that armed forces be re@@ unified into palestinian national authority the people 's army must have a broad response , but it was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( islamic ji@@ had ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 00,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some of the aff@@ ili@@ ated milit@@ ants , such as the arm@@ en@@ ian marty@@ rs ' pal@@ a@@ que , the q@@ at@@ ar 's eag@@ le , etc.
the us government has decided to hold a meeting with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of all these states and to ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the security management powers .
according to local media , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other agencies , and the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of the ministry of internal affairs .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no sub@@ tle statement .

in the same year , the 22 nd ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion team of china left shanghai for the central mountain station to conduct scientific research and examination activities and will hold a scientific examination in the central mountain station before the end of february 2006 .
because it was the first time that china issued the report on the polar region , the " report on china 's polar exploration in 2005 " also set out the requirements for china 's polar exploration undertakings , which started in the 1980 's .
according to the " report , " in 198@@ 3 , china formally joined the " treaty of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty " and became a member of the n@@ g@@ c treaty . it successively became a director - general of the n@@ g@@ ap@@ oi science research committee , the n@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic bureau , and other most influential international organization for ant@@ arc@@ tic affairs .
in 1997 , china became the member of the arc@@ tic science committee and won the support of the international community in the affairs of the arc@@ tic .
the " report " points out : over the past 20 years , china 's polar field has been completely out of its guard , developed constantly , and made up of its initial scale . it has formed a three - dimen@@ sional satellite an@@ ch@@ or@@ age system , namely , the nan@@ ji long urban station established in february 198@@ 5 , the nan@@ ji zhong@@ shan station established in february 1989 , the bei@@ polar station established in july 2004 , and the northern pol@@ e station in the southern part of the huang he in
the report statistics show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tions in the south china extreme , two of which were carried by the z@@ o@@ long z@@ ong@@ z@@ ong s@@ ail@@ boat , to conduct a survey of the bi@@ polar region on its doc@@ king station . more than 3,000 people in the country have gone to inspect the site in the south of the country .
at present , we are making efforts to establish the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station , and is also china 's first inland observation station for the ant@@ arc@@ tic inland .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration cause has been successfully completed in the world 's polar exploration , but it is still far from being compared with other major polar countries .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui revealed that china will publish a book on polar exploration every year .

xinhua news agency , du@@ lin , february 17 , the news analysis : the dispatch of the missing pilot is likely to be a clear decision .
xinhua news agency reporter , gao peng , ding ying
although italy has repeatedly said that the du@@ tch winter olympics will be held in the city of per@@ u , the athletes who are used stimul@@ ants may face the my@@ ri@@ ad of j@@ ail , but judging by the various circumstances at present , this situation is not likely to occur in the main corner of the russian federation 's de@@ tain@@ ees , the russian winter cy@@ pri@@ ot police force , which is the first case of the scand@@ al .
the winter olympics in tur@@ in was bl@@ own out for the first time since the opening of the winter olympics on 16 january . o@@ '@@ ne@@ ill was found using banned drugs cards .
on the next day , the international olympic committee announced that the sending of le@@ av@@ ers out of winter olympics was already a success , and she won 15 kilometers of gold med@@ al in the winter winter olympics .
the international winter cy@@ pri@@ ot league ( i@@ pu ) made a decision on the same day to impose a two - year penalty on the sending of the three - year emb@@ argo .
the international olympic committee has been stipul@@ ating that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games will be eliminated and their quali@@ fication will be depriv@@ ed , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to the italian law , the athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate and use stimul@@ ants to try to de@@ ter the law from three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a formal meeting in the current winter olympics to deal with the issue of using stimul@@ ants by athletes in accordance with the italian law .
after the i@@ oc 's ceas@@ eless efforts , italy has made remarkable progress in four days before the winter olympics opening , promising that the police would not go to the olympic village to search the athletes ' places , but the scre@@ am@@ ing of the her@@ bal pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary chinese athletes will still be investigated by the italian prosecu@@ tors .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the development of the winter olympics in tur@@ in , per@@ ry , and has sent the stimul@@ ant to tur@@ in 's procuratorial organs .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ ry themselves have not yet been confirmed .
russian winter cy@@ pri@@ ot di@@ am@@ on@@ ds , m@@ s. m@@ iz@@ ov , revealed at noon on 17 april that the le@@ av@@ ers had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he was once a member of the world anti - sp@@ ous@@ ing organization for many years . shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : once the s@@ port is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ easy .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great contributions to the peace process in the winter olympics .
according to the previous reports made by italy on the use of stimul@@ ants by its own athletes , the most serious punishment given by the banned persons is merely two years of imprisonment and a p@@ ack of execution .
therefore , the italian am@@ az@@ on news agency , le@@ i@@ th@@ o , said that the possibility of sending le@@ i@@ ds into prison was extremely small , and the most important thing was to impose fines .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could conduct a abs@@ ence trial , the italian police could not go abroad to send the li@@ ps to take their sentences .
if the le@@ av@@ ers refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take her .
