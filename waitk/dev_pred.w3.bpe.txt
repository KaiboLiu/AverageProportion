chinese expert : america 's pre@@ ach@@ ing of china 's military threat is unreasonable
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has made great efforts to promote the development of the country 's economy and trade , said a senior official with the us department of defense here today
experts believe that this is a serious challenge to china 's normal national defense construction , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the chinese military threat is a interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
this long - term 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s on the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt , and has directly mentioned china 's bi@@ ograph@@ ical and bi@@ ograph@@ ical phr@@ ase , which is both china 's and china 's , and said that china , as a major and newly emerging power , is most capable of engaging in military competition with the united states .
the world military research institute of the chinese military academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said : although senior us military officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time the united states has proposed in its report on defense strategy that china is the most likely new big power with a new threat to the united states .
this , this report clearly pointed out for the first time that russia has made india 's biggest strategic oppon@@ ent , especially its so - called china military threat theory , a so - called " china military threat theory " .
the chinese military delegation arrived in beijing on the evening of 19 august .
what merits our attention is that in the " four - year defense review report , " on the same day that us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the budget for the fiscal year 2007 , of which the national defense budget was $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the fact that you have been doing military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for the fiscal year 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , creating a new historical high , and p@@ ang guang@@ qian said that this is almost the same as the military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states fabr@@ icated lies in other countries ' theory of threat reflect the consistent style of the pentagon in creating enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to gain more benefits for the us arms industrial group .
experts said that the huge military spending of the united states is much more limited than that of the united states .
he has participated in many times in the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in the white paper on china 's national defense , said that as the economy developed in the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the state 's financial expenditures has generally declined during the same period .
official data show that the number of people who were engaged in national defense spending in 2004 was about 10 percent less than that in the same period of the year .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending will be 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - thir@@ ty - 14 percent of the us national defense budget , and the per capita military spending will be about one - thir@@ ty of the us military , and the per capita military spending will be about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area and china 's territorial land are generally quite similar , but its military spending is so huge , and who is the military force that goes beyond the proper defense needs is self - evident . this is a non@@ sense .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their oppon@@ ents milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china used to be a country without its existence , and it would not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established diplomatic military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a military force to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 military bases abroad , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor liu yun@@ shan , professor at the institute of international relations at beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

china 's hamas ' cabinet seeking breakthroughs in gaza , may 15
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observ@@ ations ) hamas has found a way to break through the hamas cabinet
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang ju
the islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the victory in the legislative council election , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
hamas will pursue what new policies will directly affect the peace process 's next step .
at the same time , the resistance of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points of future developments in the cabinet .
the party central committee and the state council have attached great importance to the work of the party and government .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some people outside the world worried that hamas prime minister 's presence might have a difference with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the visiting chinese hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed that the hamas - led new palestinian government would not recognize israel , and this tough signal also intensified the international recognition of israel .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that has real power and use this as a threat to suspend economic aid to palestine and handed over tax to palestine .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , elec@@ ting independent people is a compromise policy .
according to reports , to maxim@@ ize the international recognition , the recent summit meeting of hamas and domestic leaders in egypt decided to select an independent member of the board of the islamic university of cali@@ for@@ nia , j@@ im@@ al , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not received the response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian government has always been concerned about the situation in which the government is the most crucial candidate for the post .
the party 's basic line of thought is the fundamental principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the party and the state .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas is the lack of a sufficient experience in governance .
palestinian newspaper " daily " analyzed that the hamas 's " political and social welfare projects " have caught people 's hearts , but in terms of governance , hamas l@@ acked experience and established a " new alliance " with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has gained the ruling experience .
hamas has proposed a new round of talks with fat@@ ah after the election , and has jointly established a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah is currently in power to decide whether to join the cabinet . a faction that advocates participating in the new government will be able to do something , and another faction rej@@ ects hamas 's invitation and is willing to make a positive opposition to the legisl@@ ature .
the informed source pointed out that the united states had made a decision to withdraw from the new government under the persu@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah also have reached a consensus on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee framework , which is out of the party - to - party cabinet .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean expert - type government , but the specific name list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government has no longer become a form of cabinet building that reli@@ es on external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will be held in beijing on 16 february after the new legislative council is inaug@@ ur@@ ated . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the party committee and the state council have always attached great importance to the issue of what should be the focus of the armed forces ?
the weapons in hamas are to form a new government , and another thor@@ ny problem facing it .
the united states and israel have been extremely tough in their attitude and have resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect their armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ ass@@ ad on 9 april stressed that armed resistance is the key strategic option for the organization .
armed issues actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has been trying to win the election of the first major party in the legislative council through a democratic and free way , and has made its subordinate armed forces , c@@ z@@ an@@ z@@ o , the same way of leg@@ alizing the case , to bring it into the government 's security agency .
hamas once proposed to send armed groups to palestinian national authority .
the palestinian people have 6@@ 00,000 security personnel , and the majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some un@@ stable and dis@@ organized armed milit@@ ants , such as the arm@@ is@@ tice of the marty@@ r an@@ ass@@ a 's marty@@ r , the eag@@ le of the fat@@ ah movement , and so on .
the government of hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of each other and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to manage security .
according to local media , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , and the new government 's interior ministry is under the management of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no sign of any change .
