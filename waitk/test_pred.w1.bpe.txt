experts believe that the insurance industry , the over@@ shad@@ ow , and the short term will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market funds .
china news net , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the other day , the " interim procedures for management of investment in insurance funds outside the country " was promulgated , and insurance funds had a broader space for using the capital market .
china 's l@@ ung@@ cheng share@@ holding company chief investment officer liu le@@ fei said that the appreciation of the renminbi and the domestic capital market are good , and insurance institutions will not make large - scale investment through foreign exchange purchase in the short run . this also means that the insurance industry will not diver@@ t domestic stock capital within a short period of time .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that since the current situation of the renminbi 's household sales market is not yet over , the insurance organs are not fully prepared to avoid risks , and therefore the time for large - scale foreign exchange procurement is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : the long - term situation is that in the allocation of assets , foreign investment should play a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the renminbi has a greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to carry out foreign investment .
as for the purchase of foreign exchange , the current situation should be cautious .

china news net , july 23 chen zhi@@ qin
the taiwanese judicial department has been responsible for the management of the chang@@ zhi court , said on the same day that the performance of judges on the island is not in line with chen shui - bian 's remarks and has asked chen shui - bian to explain his remarks .
according to a report by taiwan 's " zhi@@ fu " on 30 june , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the prosecu@@ tor or investig@@ ators , because of political factors or election considerations , and even tried to influence the election activities of candidates of various parties . he said that he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's doubts , the director of the taiwan affairs office , su yue - sheng , did not respond to him , and fan guang@@ q@@ in@@ q@@ un , which was co - ordin@@ ated by gao jin@@ g@@ yi , represented by the judicial yuan .

gao jin@@ chi 's ep@@ it@@ ome pointed out that the high - grade team of the kaohsiung branch clu@@ bs zhang sheng@@ xi attended the k@@ ad@@ ha@@ ka school a few years ago , that is , because the relevant curriculum has the political party col@@ ors and the resolution adopted by the self - discipline committee formed by judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi was once trying to take part in the dpp sc@@ um and was also dis@@ missed from his position in the election .

german company plans to reduce professional talent
j@@ f@@ j@@ b carries photo of pla 's special training exercise on 1 july in ber@@ lin ( by wang huai@@ cheng )
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ al@@ man@@ n said a few days ago that germany should reduce the burden of " the ver@@ bal law " on the import of foreign professional talent , and resolve the problem of germany 's professional talent by increasing the import of foreign talent .
according to the agreement reached by the o@@ ec@@ d , german household electrical appliances , between 15 and 64 , will be gradually reduced .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , until 20@@ :@@ 00 , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6@@ -@@ 6 percent compared with the present .
however , german employers ' federation and german engine@@ ers association reported that the number of employees working in germany 's current labor market , the professional talent of engine@@ er 's sc@@ al@@ es , and the technology of the engine@@ er 's sc@@ al@@ es are quite big .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , the supply of engine@@ ers in the german labor market was about 1.@@ 27 million , while the technical master was about 9@@ 600 .
german authorities have been trying to protect the employment of its own people and set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of foreign talent .
german newspaper " pu@@ tong@@ hua law " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain employment and residence permits .
the s@@ ay@@ man suggested that the quota be lowered to the level of the sc@@ u@@ ba .
do not believe in laws and theories , but they are not completely different from the theory of laws .
recently , the npc standing committee submitted a " law on lawyers " to the npc standing committee for deliberation to article 8 of the draft amendment stipulates that those who have engaged in such professional work as law research and demonstration work , and those who have high - level , high - grade , and similar professional standards shall apply for a law@@ yer 's profession . after examining and approv@@ ing the judicial administration of the state council , they may be allowed to run in the law profession .
( june 28 issue of " china 's zhi@@ jian " )
the law has its theoretical circle , its origin , and its auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity . the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and other household - type aud@@ itor@@ ium work . the latter is engaged in legal consul@@ ting services such as legal consul@@ ting , legal consul@@ ting service , and legal service for legal services .
for a long time , the theory of law and the practice of ver@@ tical management exist among different cl@@ ues and ver@@ tical tri@@ um@@ p@@ ts , and the theory of each household , the theoretical circle , considered the essential attribu@@ tes of the shu@@ tt@@ le and the v@@ ap@@ our of the field . the l@@ uc@@ ky cl@@ ay of the machine tools , the water - covered w@@ ings of the w@@ ings , and the water - w@@ ov@@ en cl@@ a@@ ked from the bottom of the water , the water
as for such division of labor , the legal effect of the law is to maintain the situation , not to support any one party .
however , the law of lawyers has been over@@ shad@@ owed by the law . it is obj@@ ectively recognized the law 's theoretical char@@ m , which is higher than the law 's ver@@ tical management of the real affairs .
in fact , some people engaged in the legal system , such as international law of ver@@ bal mechan@@ ics , and other experts and scholars engaged in teaching , and their theory of over@@ emphasis and deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper levels are also closely related to the actual law .
this will be the case of the ren@@ aul@@ t lawyers system , which is undoubtedly the result of the confu@@ sion of the legal profession 's qualifications and poor quality .
right , they have a good understanding of the theory of the sc@@ u@@ ba field , such as experts and experts ' proof that they will often influence or even ve@@ to the court 's verdic@@ t , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

the british government 's ren@@ de@@ z@@ v@@ ous attack team has been reduced from the highest level to the highest level of the sc@@ u@@ d level , which indicates that the terrorist attack in britain will not happen soon . the attack still could be extremely successful .
at present , the british police have transferred the investigation scope to india and australia .
since the arrested person was arrested , the us side has been conducting a series of measures to deal with the entry of outside immigrants who are working in the medical system .
it is reported that nearly 100 percent of the drug addic@@ ts working in the british public medical system were from overseas .

however , the number of tourists travel@@ ing in the mainland has been so bad that they have met with such an worry , and they have been surr@@ ounded by the sh@@ op@@ thr@@ u@@ sts and the intermedi@@ ary businesses .
no matter whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , the tr@@ uc@@ ks will always be under the pressure of small traders and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling flowers .
you can n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and there is a big problem that is un@@ successful .
in some places where wind and waves are bl@@ owing , many kinds of trees are equally felt .
the un@@ sold do@@ ors are some people who are using their tourist sc@@ outs and small - scale household appliances .
further , after entering the door , this situation will be even more favorable .
zeng qinghong , director of the general office of the cpc central committee and vice premier of the state council , met with a delegation of foreign tourists from xi@@ '@@ an to attend a forum on the city 's fol@@ k songs in xi@@ '@@ an . however , he was un@@ easy to allow more small - sized and small - sized haw@@ kers to go all out to seek refu@@ ge .

the important thing is that these kinds of lies are the wind@@ ows of the building of local spiritual civilization , and the whole le@@ op@@ ard is not just an image issue , but also will have an impact on local economic development .
just think , you must do a big job of making tourism strong , but use this kind of chao@@ tic and d@@ ul@@ l tourism environment to gre@@ et the guests from the north to the south . whoever wants to come , who will dare to come ?
you have a very good tourist economy , how can you achieve economic results ?
with the rapid growth of tourism , the new tourism industry has created a new environment for tourists from the north of the sky . it should be said that the urgent task is to be over@@ looked .
the water is not a market , and the operation of small - sized haw@@ kers should be standardized . without a license , they should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment is the only way to let the trees feel happy and to go all out to the end .

the auth@@ or has made a detailed analysis of the improvement of the family life , but he has taken the initiative to defend the tri@@ um@@ p@@ h , and the practice of saving water with a sense of honor is a complicated one .
the building of street dec@@ or@@ ation office deputy director said that the sc@@ um of the street was aimed at the low protection and encouraged the withdrawal of the min@@ es@@ we@@ eping and other problems on their own initiative . it was a model for other low - income security households .
this example is if the party encourages other low - income insur@@ ers to work to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament , but indeed it is worth advocating . if they want to use the s@@ ens@@ ation to help those who have been che@@ ating for a long time , they are not so n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the section on differ@@ enti@@ ation and on - site protection , more of the resources are the law .
the relevant departments should strengthen the management of low - income households in the course of enjoying low - income insurance : if the information is promptly reported on the changes in family and income , the employment situation , and the acceptance of regular re@@ examination , the relevant departments should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , the ren@@ de@@ z@@ v@@ ous log@@ ging according to law is a long - term plan .
the street index is one of the reasons for the re@@ treat of the family .
the street , as a primary - level government organization , is the expenditure of the financial appropri@@ ation .
the " falungong " cult has also turned a blind eye to the money from the tax@@ pay@@ er ?
on the one hand , the policy of with@@ drawing from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have certain self - suffici@@ ency capability , and on the other hand , the number of those who apply for low - income insurance is not yet available ?
the " s@@ avi@@ or " government finance appropri@@ ation , which is called a saving money , should be given in the s@@ now@@ y weather , rather than the gold .

the new leader of the new party , the largest - ever ever - growing force , is the most critical result of the power of ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher authorities , and the direction of power sources determine that the former must be responsible to the people .
the power source and the responsibility for whom are the key to determining the success of the work of the elected .
some people question this kind of ru@@ shing democratic fashion like a game of w@@ ov@@ en democratic show .
i mean that the united states has this kind of sc@@ u@@ ba form , that is , it is better than it did .

india 's presidential election opened on 19 june , and the new president will be elected vice president at the presidential palace , including former vice president sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze and l@@ ari@@ jan@@ i , who was not appointed not long ago .
p@@ ap@@ u@@ t is a first high - ranking official in indian history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president of india 's ying@@ zhi .
p@@ ap@@ u@@ a is the ruling party 's presidential candidate , and sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ te comes from the opposition party 's people 's party .
since the national congress party has been elected in the presidential election group , the media and the public have been elected one after another , and the possibility of par@@ ach@@ u@@ ting is quite great .
the 72 - year - old p@@ y@@ ram@@ id was the female b@@ and@@ ar ser@@ b leader .
she was a law@@ yer and a v@@ aul@@ t into congress . she experienced we@@ ed and wo@@ e . she was warmly received by the government during her ten@@ ure as head of the l@@ ari@@ jan@@ a state .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was a great many cultural rel@@ ics and social welfare organizations .
analysts believe that the p@@ ap@@ ach@@ e has become a candidate because she has never w@@ aged her un@@ w@@ aver@@ ing in the fact that the chairman of the congress party of india s@@ om@@ ali g@@ hal@@ i is gansu .
in india , g@@ and@@ hi 's family has been controlling the ruling party for a long time .
p@@ ap@@ ach@@ e was welcomed by a large number of female voters , and female voters believed that par@@ agu@@ ay would be dis@@ crimin@@ ated against female values in india 's image of a serious du@@ b@@ bed female , which would raise the female status .
the constitution stipulates that india is a member of the federal system , and the president is the head of state of the country in the name of the president . it does not represent any party organization , and more importantly it is a symbol@@ ic one .

this is the truth of the integration of the mechan@@ ized corps into the actual work of its posts , and the focus of its efforts to improve the overall quality of its cadres .
this year , the man 's armed forces committee held a forum at the grass - roots level to investigate and study the situation . it was discovered that some special cadres had their posts , such as chief commanders , managers , and officers , and did not concentrate their main efforts on the armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of concentr@@ ating on training and using the training of local party schools to support the training of local party schools , and regularly train and train specialized cadres , and have focused on solving problems such as the lack of professional knowledge and the lack of professional quality .
in connection with the central work , we boldly handed over tasks to special cadres , and temper@@ ed their positions to improve their abilities in their positions .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on the selection of cadres by specialized force " , explicitly stipul@@ ating that the minister of the armed forces must go into the party committee team and stop the other duties .
the system has established a system for readjusting and exchanging cadres with special force , and has set up a system for exchanging military skills and a system for re@@ organizing and exchanging military skills that is not suited to the basic level of the armed forces , and has promptly adjusted and exchanged the cadres , and has also promoted and used the comrades who have strong overall quality and good work ability .
not long ago , the xin@@ century 's ren@@ fang company 's chief of staff chen yi@@ song led the militi@@ a technical detachment to innovate and develop under@@ water vessel sc@@ aff@@ olding technology , filling up the internal sc@@ u@@ ds , and being upgraded to the director of the armed forces of the company .
good - b@@ ye also wants to end
the number of participants who won the champion@@ ship alone is 2 - 2 , and the number of participants can also be accepted . the key is the match process , how much regre@@ ts are people .
if it is the second time that iran has taken the lead by 2 to 0 , then the pol@@ es will be equ@@ ated , and the feeling of china 's ge@@ opol@@ i@@ tics is definitely different , it will be very long and the fl@@ ower will be the same .
good - hear@@ ted , un@@ ending , it can be said that one thing is different .
the number of people who are often under the situation of l@@ oud situations is not a ball , and the views of ordinary people are not up to the mark in china 's psychological quality .
this is indeed a case of not being able to distingu@@ ish between good and bad .
however , judging from what is happ@@ ening today , it seems that the match is not completely .
sun ji@@ hai 's sun ji@@ xiang sh@@ ao ji@@ ye , zheng zhi@@ zhi and others were k@@ ic@@ ked in europe but did not say that li wei feng and others were also the old ones who had been the s@@ and - sh@@ aking ones . they see more clearly and say nothing about their psychological quality .
the purpose of this mis@@ fortune was regre@@ tted by the iranian team , perhaps the reason was that the troops were deployed to carry out the missions .
iran team beat the united states in a backward condition .
the sh@@ oes were not changed in the second half .
we should overcome the difficulties that are good at beginning and cannot be good at ending , and we must find the root of problems .
as long as the problem is accurately identified , the method of rev@@ am@@ ping the problems will probably not be found .
they are afraid of being too hast@@ y and un@@ necessary to seek medical treatment .
if this goes on , it will be a more swe@@ eping match . the old ones will also make a mistake , and the talks will not be a k@@ ick that everyone hopes .
