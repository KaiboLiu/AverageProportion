experts believe that this is a ground@@ less accus@@ ation and ex@@ agg@@ eration of china 's military threat theory , which plays up china 's military threat , is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new document of national defense guidance of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to discuss the issue of china 's military strength and the way the united states should respond to it , which were directly sent to the two stages of china or china , said that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest military competitive power with the united states , and if the united states does not have any countermeasures , china will very likely develop a destruc@@ tive military technology , thus breaking its traditional military technology .
the director of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the emerging major country that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
for the first time , the report clearly descri@@ bes russia as a new strategic ri@@ val , especially its so - called military threat to china , as a new strategic oppon@@ ent .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget . the national defense budget was 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the united states is to step up its military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us creation of a threatening theory of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon that cre@@ ates enemies . its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and provide more support for the huge us arms industrial complex .
experts say that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has attended many times the military expert on china 's national defense white papers , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the overall proportion of national defense expenditures has declined .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over 50 percent of the national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - tenth of the us military expenditure , which is about one - sixth of the us military expenditure , and the per capita military spending of the us military is about one - thir@@ ds .
the territorial size of america and china 's territorial area are r@@ oughly the same , but the difference in military expenditure is so big , and who , in the end , has the military power exceeding the normal defense requirements , and this is something that cannot be said to be compared to .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , director teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been , and will not be , will not pose any threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed over 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas sets up cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observers ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter , hao huang .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for a new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas implement directly affect the next step of the relevant policy orientation of the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points in the forming of the cabinet that involve future development of the situation .
the premier 's post will be fl@@ owing down , and who will be the president ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people outside worried that hamas prime minister might be able to have differences with the current top leader , ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas would not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concerns .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government with real power and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and hand over taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not hin@@ der hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the greatest extent , hamas and other local and foreign leaders recently decided to elect the independent chairman of the board of directors of the q@@ as@@ ar@@ i islamic university , j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta .
this move has not yet received response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts said that no matter how heavy the prime minister 's post is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to less@@ en the hard@@ line color of hamas before it can ass@@ ure its success .
how to distribu@@ te power
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing hamas forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily newspaper carried an analysis saying that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered in the hearts of the people , but in the aspect of governance , it lacks experience in dealing with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has ruling experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing diplomatic partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly establishing a coalition government with fat@@ ah , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are different opinions on whether to join the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government , thus achieving something in this respect , while the other is willing to actively work on opposition parties in the legislative committee .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , the hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold discussions on the distribution of cabinet positions .
another way is to establish a framework for the formation of a socialist party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is also unable to form a cabinet - forming method to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the palestinian national authority nom@@ inated the prime minister and formed the cabinet three weeks from 16 january to 5 february after the new term of office of the legislative council was s@@ wor@@ n in .
what path will the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another major thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israeli stances are very tough , and they resolutely demand hamas to abandon violence and refuse to take part in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on the 9@@ th that armed resistance is the strategic choice of that organization .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas 's election through democratic and free means was elected the first largest party in the legisl@@ ature , which led to the simultane@@ ous leg@@ alization of its subordinate armed factions , namely , unifying it into the government security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions into the people 's army of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a broad response , and it was also opposed by the islamic ji@@ had ( je@@ wish ) of palestine .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some subordinate armed factions that are lo@@ ose in organization relations , such as the xiang@@ sat@@ a brigade , a subordinate marty@@ r of al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs , et@@ c .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must negoti@@ ate with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of each country and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the authority for security management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations are under the control of the ministry of interior of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further news .

japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney system
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the east china sea university of japan has developed a biological kid@@ ney for human kid@@ ne@@ ys , which not only has the same functions as human kid@@ ne@@ ys , but also has the function of re@@ taining material elements . it is small in size and easily trans@@ planting . with the study deepening , it is expected to bring a good news to the patients who are ill of kid@@ ney disease .
according to a recent report in the ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , part of which is fil@@ ter and water@@ shed , the ster@@ il@@ ization of the waste and the separation of water from the original ur@@ ine , lieutenant general in am@@ in@@ o and kil@@ im@@ in@@ o , which have other components of the blood used for re@@ entry to the ster@@ y of the blood - produced w@@ as@@ er , such as the former .
the scientists of the kid@@ ney - making and tw@@ in - made be@@ ams are all made up of the sil@@ k line of the central air force , and the inner side of the enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ement of the w@@ oo@@ ds is filled with the functions of xie x@@ ur@@ en .
this kind of upper sk@@ in cell@@ s can cause diseases that have caused many times , which are related to the gen@@ es of the organic ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents , to be divided into the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id and returned to the blood , and at the same time , it can also enable the body 's w@@ ine , m@@ ell@@ ac@@ i@@ us , and other matter to re - enter the blood .

he also said that the south african government would do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
fu said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every one of the foreigners working in south africa will have the safety of their lives and property , and that the security of their property will be fully protected by local law and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese people 's world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa over this and has reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship between the overseas chinese and the police , and jointly crack down on criminal activities .
we express our sincere condol@@ ences and condol@@ ences to the family of the victims .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are sor@@ ry for this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is earnestly investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully solved the case of a murder of a chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
in addition , according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspect involved in the shooting of a hong kong business@@ man in january this year has been arrested by south african police and the money and property of the victim has been recovered .
on the possibility of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that these incidents are indeed a serious threat to the trade of tourism between the two countries and to exchanges in other fields , but from a long - term perspective , the impact on the media should not be greater than that .
the south african embassy 's tourism commissioner , n@@ ann@@ e be@@ he@@ i , said that the embassy had issued over 2,000 chinese vis@@ as to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official chinese statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent year on year .
however , people in the tourism circle believe that the incidents of chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 have a clear impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , chinese tourists to south africa were 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 in the first half of 2005 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
the chinese living in south africa are now around 200,000 people , and they are located in the towns and villages of south africa .
analysts here believe that the wide gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of guns , there is no deterr@@ ent to death , and the crime rate is high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash at hand and at home , and they are more likely to become victims of the criminal elements ' scheme for money .

xinhua news agency reporter , gao ying
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , saying that the bodies of people who were found to be using stimul@@ ants during the winter olympics may be facing the sex@@ ual disaster of the spir@@ its of the war@@ r@@ ants , judging from various circumstances at present , this situation is not very likely to be the main character of the stimul@@ ant scand@@ al at the current winter olympics games , russia 's play@@ er , the one of the two of the stimul@@ ants scand@@ als .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games on 16 june , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening ceremony , o@@ '@@ ne@@ v@@ a was found to have used a drug - free card .
the i@@ oc announced the following day that it had been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics and that she had won the winter champion@@ ship in the winter games .
the international winter and quarterly league made a decision on the same day to impose a two - year ban on the distribution of ill@@ iter@@ ates .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are un@@ covered and used stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and will be dis@@ missed and depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the games , but will not be punished by the law .
however , according to italian law , the drugs carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the d@@ oping players , who try to def@@ y the law will face a severe test of imprisonment of three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to settle the issue of the stimul@@ ant used by the athletes in accordance with italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to search the host country 's seat . however , athletes who are showing positive drugs will still be investigated by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government over@@ sees the winter olympics , pe@@ is@@ can@@ t , an official from the italian government , has handed over the stimul@@ ant from li@@ e@@ wa to the du@@ h@@ r@@ ing@@ in procuratorate .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ is@@ can@@ t themselves have not yet confirmed this .
the russian winter team , the two team , and@@ er@@ son , revealed at noon on the 17@@ th that al@@ ph@@ a had left du@@ sh@@ in and returned to the country .
he has served in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng believes that once a le@@ av@@ a returns to china , this matter may eventually lead to the end of that .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have made great efforts to promote the cooperation between the i@@ oc and the italian winter sports council , even if italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in this matter , the result is hard to say .
according to the previous practice of italy 's p@@ uni@@ tive use of stimul@@ ants , the maximum penalty given to the banned is only two years of imprisonment suspended for the two years .
therefore , senior italian news agency journalist pi@@ er@@ re said that the reason for le@@ av@@ a 's presence in prison is very small , at most , the fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be ab@@ sent , it is impossible for the italian police to cap@@ ture leg@@ a and take a sentence back from abroad .
if they sent len@@ a to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side would have no way to take her .
