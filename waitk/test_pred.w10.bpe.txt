liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's li@@ ang@@ jie company , believes that the rmb 's appreciation and the domestic capital market will be good , and the large - scale re@@ valuation of the insurance institutions will not be foreign exchange for overseas investment , which also means insurance will not be diverted to domestic stock markets within a short time .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that since there is no such thing as renminbi market , insurance institutions are not able to avoid risks , the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long term , in the area of asset allocation , foreign investment should account for a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the relatively great pressure on the appreciation of the renminbi at present , china 's sun@@ ken will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make overseas investments .
in the current situation , we should take a cautious attitude toward foreign investments that are purchased from abroad .

germany to reduce import of professionals
the pla 's ber@@ lin , july 1 , ( reporter huai@@ cheng wang )
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ aw@@ n said recently that germany should lower its " cha@@ ol@@ un " restriction on the import of foreign professionals and solve germany 's problems in professional personnel by increasing the import of foreign talented personnel .
according to o@@ ec@@ d report , from now to time in germany , the number of labor force aged between 15 and 64 will decrease year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation to 20@@ 60 , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6 % compared with the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german association of engine@@ ers have reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers and engine@@ ers are more capable of performing professional skills .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , the supply of engine@@ ers on the labor market in germany this may is about 1@@ 27@@ 0,000 people , and the supply of some 9@@ ,@@ 600 workers is now on stream .
to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
" he@@ zi " stipulates that professional personnel from non - eu countries are not che@@ aper than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain permission to work and stay in germany .
sha wan suggested low@@ ering this quota to he@@ w up .
not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous legal theory ,
the " law on lawyers , " which was recently submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , stipulates that those who have engaged in professional work such as teaching and studying legal affairs , as well as those who have a high level or similar professional level , may apply for lawyers ' service , after being examined and approved by the judicial administrative department of the state council , be allowed to practi@@ se their profession .
( june 28 , " china 's uni " )
there are many different religions in law , including he@@ w teaching and research , the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and more often than not , and the latter is engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , legal consultation , legal services , and other specific activities , and other specific activities .
for a long time , there exists a traditional friendship between legal experts and people in the field of culture , and people 's differences in culture , and the theoretical circles believe that the lack of necessary ri@@ f@@ ts in the field of affairs is only a case of leg@@ ism of falungong , a person of the marxist doctr@@ ine , and a person of truth - seeking and pragmatic business people who are engaged in the study of theories in the life of life , and who are critical , in@@ effective and in@@ effective in
the legal system can maintain stability and keep things in order to support each other , because of the difference in division of labor .
however , cu@@ i jie , a voice - shap@@ ed law@@ yer in the law , has obj@@ ectively recognized that legal circles should be superior to legal affairs and judicial affairs and judg@@ ments .
in fact , some people engaged in purely theoretical research and teaching on the basis of legal system , such as international law , are no longer deeply involved in theories , but are also extremely close to law .
this way , the voice of the legal community is no doubt a dis@@ orderly and un@@ satisfactory , super@@ ficial qualifications of legal affairs .
not only do super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous elements in theoretical circles , but also do so , such as experts and experts ' assess@@ ments , will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court verdic@@ t , and this is also the direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain lowered the level of terrorist attacks .
the reporter learned from the xinhua news agency in london on 5 july ( reporter guo lin )
the british government lowered the level of terrorist attacks from the highest level to severe sun@@ l@@ it , indicating that terrorist attacks in britain will not happen soon , but attacks still have extreme possibility of attack .
at present , the british police have transferred the scope of investigation to india and australia .
since all the eight suspects arrested were working in the medical system , the government will impose a series of emergency checks on the background of migr@@ ants who are working in the medical system .
it is reported that nearly x@@ uan people working in britain 's public health system are all qualified for medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also asked to investigate high - tech migr@@ ation background , and employers or relevant organizations would be asked to provide background information .
do n't let traders worry .
the pictures are relaxed , sun@@ light , and enjoy the nature and nature to the maximum extent .
but many people are experi@@ encing this kind of worry , and many people are now being taken to the side of a business called up by traders and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
no matter whether it 's cars or tr@@ ains , + shang@@ ku@@ i cars , they will always be hit by small traders and some intermedi@@ ary without certificates .
it was not selling pe@@ d@@ le pe@@ pp@@ er , that is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many non - certificates - proof intermedi@@ ary reporting , and even false reporting ,
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and if you do n't succeed , you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
many sun@@ ni feel the same .
before entering the door , some people would travel on and talk about things in a small , sun@@ ny manner .
after entering the door , this situation will be more serious , and the good y@@ a@@ xing is also exposed to the sh@@ ame of the word .
some media reports said that many foreign tourists visiting xian have praised ancient ancient ancient sil@@ k sites , but they have expressed deep feelings for the small mer@@ ch@@ ants who have been allowed to sell many of them .
this type of sun@@ light , which is used to make a trip , is a place that can move and that should be characterized by orderly , orderly , peaceful , and harmonious , and a qu@@ iet and gent@@ le environment .
the freedom of the business community has sti@@ r@@ red up trouble , and it does not say anything to the point , obj@@ ectively disrup@@ ting these public order , creating pollution and environmental pollution , and providing conditions and opportunities for the sun@@ light .
what is important is that these are window - dres@@ sed in the building of spiritual civilization in our region , but what we see is not only an image issue , but also an impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to make a big and strong tourism industry , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic tourism environment to gre@@ et the guests from south to north . who is willing to come , who da@@ res to come ?
how will your tourism economy yield ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the north and south . it should be said that the pressing task at the moment is to make the tourist industry look good at .
the operation of small - scale haw@@ kers should be standardized without a license , and illegal activities should be resolutely dealt with .
only when a civilized and orderly environment is created can one feel happy and be able to go through , go back to life , and be re@@ united .
let the business not be imp@@ ati@@ ent .
not being able to do it ,
the city 's jian@@ xi street used distribution of electric he@@ xi and other items as an award for 12 households that took the initiative to re@@ treat .
( xin@@ jing bao , july 10 )
i am pleased with the improvement of these families ' life , but i am still very angr@@ y with the old style of re@@ treating on one 's own initiative and re@@ taining others on one 's own initiative .
ji@@ ao@@ ji street office deputy director said that in view of problems such as sc@@ u@@ f@@ f@@ f@@ ing and keeping low , encouraging active re@@ treat and protection was a model for other low - income households .
this example is how to encourage other under@@ priv@@ il@@ eg@@ ed personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament , and if they want to use this to influence and che@@ at those who have long been sav@@ ed by fraud , they are not ad@@ ult .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up low - income households , what we rely more on is the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the obligations of the minimum guarantee households in enjoying the minimum allow@@ able income : for example , timely report on the changes in family personnel and income , report the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , and the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term strategy to replace others according to law .
the neighbor@@ hood re@@ wards the family that has been released from prison , who is going to be bur@@ ied ?
the expenditure of the street , as a primary government organization , is borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
and the money of a tax@@ pay@@ er should not be spent .
on the one hand , those who qu@@ it the minimum guarantee have proved that they have certain capability to be self - sufficient and that on the other hand , do n't those applying for minimum assurance still exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , known as life - saving money , should be given an emergency in the snow , not adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang - yi 's willingness to serve was more than a bit more imper@@ iled .
on 10 july , china 's first village named fang lan , in xin@@ du district , liu tong@@ ji , was given the fourth time democratic priority to liu t@@ ang@@ yi , liu xiang@@ yi , who took office , and his satisfaction rate reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
in the dialogue between the reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a young man who served on him .
( yesterday 's xin@@ jing bao )
liu gang 's he@@ w service group may be more than a cadre who appointed , and cadres who are now , who are more true and true , and who are more capable of doing something .
the greatest challenge in the system of directly elec@@ ting candidates lies in the fact that the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members and masses on the source of power , the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the former determin@@ es that the responsibility for the people must be put in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility to those who are elected are the fundamental factors that determine how the people who are elected should carry out their work .
some people doubt such a democratic , sun@@ sh@@ ine , and even more like a sun@@ light .
my view is that there is such a kind of sun@@ ken , democracy , but it is better .
considering the history and current situation of the building of china 's grassroots democratic politics , i believe that direct elections have already become a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this important component , which should not be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .
india hop@@ efully to elect its first female president , a analy@@ st , said that the possibility of being elected is quite great , and women voters hope to raise women 's status .
on 23 june , mas@@ o@@ shi , a candidate , was shot in front of the presidential document .
the general election of the indian president began on 19 may . the new president will be elected president of the republic of india , david he@@ i , head of the state of l@@ as@@ ar state , and yo@@ he@@ i k@@ he@@ i k@@ he@@ i , who was not long ago .
p@@ ach@@ i is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
p@@ ag@@ he@@ t is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ t is from the opposition people 's party .
because the congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , media and people are likely to be elected one after another .
the 72 - year - old p@@ he@@ w is the governor of l@@ j@@ as@@ on .
she joined parliament and became experienced in the case of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural and sports organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why p@@ ai@@ ki became a candidate was because she was always ind@@ ul@@ ging in su@@ ni@@ ya , chairman of the indian national assembly .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long been in control of the ruling congress party .
pan@@ e was popular among many female voters , and the women voters believed that p@@ ach@@ i would dis@@ crimin@@ ate against the serious women - led image of india , which would raise women 's status .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is nom@@ in@@ ally the head of state and a rul@@ er , and does not represent any party organization , and still more is a symb@@ ol .

the number of reports that ev@@ o@@ ked adverse re@@ actions from di@@ a@@ bet@@ es v@@ end@@ or increased sharply .
according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the number of adverse reaction reports such as the heart disease caused by anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug , wen@@ di@@ ya , has recently shown a sharp rise in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a security warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to be cautious because scientists have published a research report in a new journal " xin kan " on may 21 , saying that this type of che@@ ap drugs will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence rates and fever inci@@ d@@ ence rates of patients .
therefore , wen di@@ ya 's he@@ ite has been closely followed by doctors and patients .
the statistics show that in about one month after the issue of safety warnings , the us drug administration received a 3@@ 57 - case report that caused adverse reaction , of which 38 were fat@@ alities .
in january and february this year , the pharmaceutical authority only received 50 and 73 adverse reaction reports .

us defense department re@@ considers reduction of us forces in europe
a us defense department official said on the 23@@ rd that due to the changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is re@@ considering a plan to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .

jing@@ jiang city 's people 's army platform to enhance quality of cadres
the pla 's cao ji@@ aq@@ ui reporting : on 18 june , a group of military cadres from jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , led by lu yu@@ qing , director of the armed forces of x@@ il@@ ai town , was given a lecture on " winning a psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " by xi l@@ il@@ an county 's head , and was unanimously praised by the cad@@ ets .
this is a simple example of how many people feel like a soldier 's unit , which has made new achievements in solving problems in the field of communications and in improving the overall quality of the military cadres .
in early 2000 , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered when conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level that some cadres with special arms were serving long term , life and duty , and did not concentrate their main energy on the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they adopted the method of training on traditional mission and relying on local party schools to train and train specialized military cadres regularly , and focused on resolving problems such as narrow - field operations among cadres with professional skills .
in light of the central task , they boldly carried out tasks to tackle problems with young cadres , and improved their abilities in their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for appointment of specialized armed forces cadres , " clearly stipul@@ ating that armed forces ministers must be in the leading body of party committees and be no longer engaged in other posts .
a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with specialized arms has been established to promptly adjust and exchange some cadres with special arms who are not quite old and who are not adap@@ ted to the work of arming the grass roots .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , director of the armed forces department of the new century , led the militi@@ a technical unit to innovate and develop under@@ water vessel technology , thus filling a domestic sh@@ ock , and upgrading it to the director of the armed forces department of the company .
good , and perfect
in the result of the competition alone , the score is reasonable and also acceptable . the key is the process of the competition , and it is more or less regre@@ tful .
if iran leads iran 2 - 0 , then it will equ@@ ate the score , then it will definitely give china a feeling of difference , a long morale , a situation of strength , a situation of strength , opposite .
one can say that one is old and bad at the beginning .
he often does not play bas@@ ket under the condition of a situation , and the view of ordinary people is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a reason why you cannot sup@@ pose you can do it .
but looking at today 's competition , it seems that it is not perfect .
sun ji@@ hai 's name sh@@ ao ji@@ xin and others sh@@ ao ji@@ ji 's playing in europe , and others did not say that li wei and others were also old men of the s@@ and field for a long time . they saw many people and said that their psychological quality would not have any problem .
this time , he was forced to calm by the iranian team , probably due to the battle and his ex@@ ile .
the iranian team , in a backward situation , was replaced by two men , and the scene was immediately shown to be a bit aw@@ ful .
three people were also shot in the second half , but the effect was not good .
to overcome the problem of being good at beginning and not being able to end well , we must find the root of problems .
as long as the problems are accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find a way to solve the problem .
they were afraid of going to hospital in a hur@@ ry .
if this goes on , you will play more games , and you will commit more old mistakes , and you will not be able to play a further game that everyone is exp@@ ecting .

the troops were gradually replaced with young ones in the season .
the small group of young people who support the development of education and cooperation in the second artillery base started operation in the area of education cooperation .
this reporter , x@@ ue bing@@ jian , reporter xu qing@@ qing , the educational organization of remote units directly under the military units cannot do anything to do with resources and to fight on one 's own , and this will become a historical event at a base of the second artillery corps .
this reporter recently learned that after six months of trial , the base has issued " measures for implementing the ' program for ideological and political education ' " to cover a number of ideological and political education cooperation areas of all small , sc@@ attered , remote , and directly subordinate units of the base , which have already been officially operating .
in order to effectively implement the " program on ideological and political education , " the base organized forces to conduct in - depth investigation and study of the current state of ideological and political education in small , sc@@ attered , remote , and directly administ@@ ered units , and made key problems that affect and restr@@ ain the current situation of personnel aw@@ ak@@ ening in education , and initially formed a new model of education in small , sc@@ attered , remote , and directly administ@@ ered units .
the specific practice of the cooperative zone is to break through the dem@@ arc@@ ation line of unit establishment , design@@ ate a unit at the brigade and regiment level in the small , remote , and directly subordinate units to conduct unified planning on the theme of education , and units with different subordinate relationships are coming close to the same station to listen classes or use the system to discuss issues in a remote range .
adopting methods of practicing he@@ z@@ bol@@ lah and compe@@ ting for posts to carry out unified deployment of educational forces , unified use of educational hard@@ ware in film areas , sharing of data education experience in various units , and regular reporting of typical cases in the film area , to exchange experience with officers and soldiers , to exchange experiences , and to exchange experiences with them .
each cooperative area set up a branch of education re@@ su@@ sc@@ it@@ er and education personnel as well as education and distribution centers .
on this basis , various areas of cooperation have established systems for seeking urgent problems , for education , and for joint efforts to make a notice on the situation of emergency ideological conditions and for an assessment system .
zhang sheng@@ min , director of the political department of the base , told the reporter that the establishment of a political education cooperation zone has reduced the waste of educational resources and also deepened the educational results .
some of them are afraid of being lost in front of officers and soldiers of foreign units , and take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new methods of education .
the officers and men who were educated also enthusiastically engaged in education , fe@@ aring that they would speak out@@ sid@@ ers in front of the officers and men of neighboring units when discussing and analyzing the contents of education .
this way , it was very pr@@ on@@ ounced and encouraged .
a certain brigade under the north sea fleet has all the quota quota for soldiers .
the reporters learned from the headquarters of the north china sea fleet that a certain deputy chief engine@@ er of a certain brigade under the north china sea fleet , zhang wei@@ liang , led by zhang wei@@ liang , a certain deputy chief engine@@ er of the north china sea fleet , that the 31 soldiers of the unit had been working for a long time and had che@@ er@@ fully set foot on the be@@ id@@ ai@@ he train .
luo xiang@@ ming , a grade - 6 officer , happ@@ ily told this reporter : leaders of the brigade care for soldiers , and are deeply moved . after returning from the scene , we must work hard and cherish our good work !
it was the first time that a grassroots soldier was organized to do so .
not long ago , yao qing@@ sheng went down to the grassroots level to see some soldiers responsible for daily maintenance work , br@@ aving the fire to carry out maintenance work , which moved yao qing@@ sheng .
when soldiers forget their work , the party committee should care for and cherish soldiers and be responsible for their health .
after studying the issue , the party committee decided to div@@ ide all the quota assigned to the unit by the higher level to the soldiers working on the front line .
the work of a unit under the jin@@ an military region has been open to people , and it is not difficult to say .
staff report
wang wei@@ qin 's special trip li de@@ ying reported : on 25 july , the auth@@ or saw a unit of the jin@@ an military region that wrote a piece of important documents written by a project that was written by the army 's project of bidding for the project of recru@@ iting military personnel to be promoted to the party of non@@ commissioned officers , and other important matters , and was hang@@ ing in a window .
according to su cheng@@ sen , political commissar of the pla general staff headquarters , this is a concrete move taken by the ministry to promote the system of opening up affairs to the public .
the party committee of this unit formulated a " two - way supervision " for organs to enhance party style and build a clean government , " " public announcement on sensitive issues " and other measures , demanding that all major issues involving the immediate interests of officers and men and the opinions of grassroots units be solic@@ ited , and that decisions be made according to the requirements of the work situation , and that the officers and men should open up their work procedures and work standards according to the requirements of the actual conditions .
the unit has set up a daily nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace for the daily nec@@ k@@ l@@ ace , opening up the voice pan@@ els on the side of the unit , and extensively collecting opinions and suggestions from everyone .
early this year , before the renov@@ ation and renov@@ ation projects of soldiers ' d@@ or@@ mit@@ ory were launched , party committee organs extensively solic@@ ited the opinions of officers and soldiers , and then issued bidding information to implement open bidding .
this has sav@@ ed both funds and the support of officers and men .
the practice of opening the work to the public has given impetus to the formation of a fine atmosphere in the grassroots .
in this unit , no matter whether it is decided on major hot - spot sensitive affairs or when it comes to daily expenses for individuals to take vac@@ ation , and other items , the grassroots companies always persist in public@@ izing things on a regular basis , and consciously accept supervision by the masses .
