experts believe that insurance , um , short - term , there will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market funds .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional measures on foreign investment management of insurance funds " was promulgated recently , and insurance funds have more room for use on the capital market .
china 's top investment official liu le@@ fei believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not allow insurance institutions to invest overseas on a large scale in the short term through foreign exchange purchase . this also means that insurance , in the short term , will not diver@@ t domestic stock markets .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that since there is no renminbi 's market , insurance institutions do not have sufficient means to avoid danger , so the time for large - scale procurement of foreign exchange is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in terms of asset allocation over a long period of time , foreign investment should occupy a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the current relatively large pressure on the rmb appreciation , china will mainly make use of its foreign exchange funds to make investments overseas .
in the present circumstances , we should be cautious with respect to foreign investment in foreign exchange purchase .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly criticized judicial intervention in elections the " judicial yuan " denied and asked for an explanation .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 1 chen shui - bian questi@@ oned judicial personnel on the 30@@ th attempting to get involved in the election of leaders in the taiwan region .
taiwan 's supreme judicial council executive : k@@ ao t@@ zu [ name as transliterated ] said on the same day that the current performance of the island 's judges is not in keeping with what chen shui - bian said and that he has asked chen shui - bian to explain his statement .
according to taiwan 's " ci " report , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned prosecu@@ tors or investig@@ ators on 30 may , considering political factors or elections , and even trying to influence the campaign activities of candidates of various parties in taiwan , saying that he hoped that this phenomenon will not exist in taiwan , but it is very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's suspic@@ ion , the court president of the le le yue yue sheng did not respond , secretary general fan ku@@ ang , and the higher judicial council representative , spoke on cross - strait judicial affairs .
gao jin@@ zhi said : the basic law and code of conduct for judges from taiwan , the ill@@ iter@@ acy asser@@ tions , that judges should go beyond the party , must not be allowed to run political parties , and judges are very cautious in observing the relevant controls and believe that judges from the judicial institute will do very good work .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out : the judge of the kaohsiung high division of the kaohsiung branch zhang sheng@@ xi attended the school course of ke@@ id@@ ag@@ an several years ago , which was decided by the self - discipline committee , which was composed of judges because of the color of the relevant curriculum .
at one time , zhang sheng@@ xi wanted to participate in the dpp 's competition for the dpp , but decided to give up the party because of his election .
gao jin@@ zhi said : if it is a trial case for a particular case , it can not rely sol@@ ely on the outcome of the verdic@@ t to win . it is an indic@@ ation that judges have different political intentions .
germany to reduce entry requirements for professional talent
the first batch of the pla navy 's first batch of missile defense ( m@@ l@@ n ) ,
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ aw@@ ak@@ i said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in " the law " and , by introducing foreign talents , solve the problem of professional talent in germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , the number of labor force from 15 to 64 will be reduced year by year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , then the labor force in 20@@ n@@ ak@@ sh@@ ev will be reduced by 6@@ -@@ 0 percent .
however , the german employers ' federation and german engine@@ ers association have reported that currently in germany 's labor market , engine@@ ers with speci@@ alties are more skilled .
according to the statistics of the federal labor bureau of germany , in may this year , the supply of nec@@ essi@@ ties for engine@@ ers in the german labor market was approximately 1@@ 27 million , and the supply of technicians was about 9@@ ,@@ 600 .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " kil@@ n law " stipulates that professional personnel of non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be allowed to work and live in germany .
he suggested low@@ ering this limit to the euro to the earth .
the theory of super@@ sti@@ tion and legal
the " law@@ yer law " revised article 8 of the recently submitted draft law to the npc standing committee stipulates : those who have engaged in teaching on law and other professional work , who have high academic levels or similar professional standards , and who have applied for lawyers to carry out their duties may be granted the approval of the judicial administration departments of the state council .
( 28 june , " china 's " )
there are theoretical parties and non@@ lin@@ ear relations in the law , which mainly include legal teaching and research work .
for a long time , there exists a my@@ ster@@ y among people in the theoretical circle and among people in the field of spiritual civilization , and the theory of cross theory believes that the actual field lacks necessary kin@@ dness and the need for undertaking is only mechan@@ ized .
the law can do something to maintain such differences in division of labor , but it should not support any party .
however , the tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous law@@ yer law obj@@ ectively recogn@@ izes the theoretical circle that l@@ ags behind the law , and its judgment is that the legal profession is more pol@@ ite than the actual law .
in fact , some theories that are engaged in the research of p@@ ure theory and teaching , such as the international laws of legal systems , and their theoretical depth and actual performance are also in var@@ ying degrees with legal practice .
in this case , the tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous system of ours has undoubtedly opened a very poor foundation for the qualifications of the legal profession .
super@@ sti@@ tions in theoretical circles are not limited to these , such as experts and experts ' argu@@ ments will frequently affect or even rej@@ ect court verdic@@ ts , and this is also a direct expression of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain cu@@ ts terrorist attack
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
british government 's hor@@ se attacks fall from top level to serious level , which indicates that the terrorist attacks in britain will not occur , but the attacks are still very likely to be ter@@ ri@@ ble .
the british police have now transferred the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested were working in the medical system , and the government will take a clear and comprehensive assessment of the background of those who have entered the medical system .
it is understood that there are nearly st@@ ur@@ ach@@ ers working in the british public medical system who are receiving medical qualifications overseas .
prime minister su@@ k@@ uni also asked to investigate the background of high - tech immigrants , and employers or related organizations will be asked to provide information on the background .
let 's watch out for the traders .
the tourism char@@ t is a relaxed nu@@ t , the natural lands@@ cape , and the fruits of social civilization to the greatest extent .
but in china , many people have encountered such a kind of an@@ no@@ ying , and are being surr@@ ounded by deal@@ ers and deal@@ ers as intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is automob@@ iles or tr@@ ains , tr@@ uc@@ ks always have to face the death of small traders and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling ta@@ o@@ ist b@@ ak@@ ery , which is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many of them are not t@@ esti@@ fied to intermedi@@ ary refer@@ ences such as cat@@ ering , or even pu@@ m@@ p .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are very successful , you will be able to get into good shape .
many of these have the same feelings in some wind and fla@@ v@@ ors .
before we enter the door , there are people who are somewhat like tourism and something like minor ones .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more serious . no matter how good y@@ ar@@ xing is , he is still being sti@@ r@@ red up and un@@ easy .
some media reported that many foreign tourists visiting xian are not desp@@ ic@@ able to xian 's mon@@ uments , but they are not un@@ happy about allowing the h@@ ul@@ l of small - sized commercial haw@@ ks to sell everywhere .
these include the nu@@ ts of the stations , the ones that are from the ones that are from the ones , the areas that are in an orderly and orderly manner , and the environment of harmony among the bodies of the bre@@ eds .
the free nu@@ ts of deal@@ ers and deal@@ ers , not to mention the confu@@ sion , obj@@ ectively destroyed these public order , and created pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it also provided the conditions and opportunities for the cont@@ am@@ ination .
what is important is that these local fla@@ v@@ ors are the wind@@ ows of the building of spiritual civilization , but what they see is not only the issue of image , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to become a big and strong tourist industry , then you can use this kind of chao@@ tic tourism environment to welcome the guests coming from the south to the north . who will come and who will dare to come ?
how do you obtain benefits from your tourism economy ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the southern part of the world . it should be said that the task of the moment is very urgent .
the bu@@ b@@ bles are not the markets , the operation of small business haw@@ kers should be standardized , and operations without a license should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only by allowing the people to feel happy and go with it and re@@ invigor@@ ating it in an orderly and civilized environment can a country be prosperous .
in one word , let 's get trouble from the business deal@@ ers .
the un@@ willingness to re@@ treat and protect themselves is not enough
jian@@ du street in dong@@ cheng district of beijing municipality has suppl@@ em@@ ented electrical products and other items as re@@ wards to 12 low - guaranteed families on its own initiative .
( " xin jing bao " july 10 )
i am glad to see the improvement of the living conditions of these families , but the wor@@ ding of the le - ups on the one hand and the practice of giving incen@@ tive to others are also complex .
ji@@ ao@@ xing street office deputy director said that targ@@ eting such problems as fraud and low protection , encouraging active re@@ fund is an example of serving other low - income households .
if these examples are to encourage other people with minimum sub@@ sist@@ ence allow@@ ances to extr@@ icate themselves from difficulties through their own efforts , then it is indeed worth advocating , and if these people who have been serving their kin@@ dness for a long time to gain low protection by s@@ wind@@ ling them by means of stimul@@ ating them , they are not somewhat n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing away tu@@ mors , the law is more dependent on the household .
departments concerned should strengthen the responsibility of the minimum guarantee families when enjoying the minimum guarantee : they should report in a timely manner the changes in family personnel and income , report on employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , while the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is only a long - term strategy to rever@@ se its promise .
the streets reward families who are given with re@@ funds , who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who is the one who
as a first - class government organization , the street 's expenditures are borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
the money of a tax@@ pay@@ er should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency , and on the other hand , do n't those who apply for low - income insurance still exist ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ations , known as the life - saving money , should be provided with char@@ coal in the s@@ now@@ y weather rather than added flowers .
liu gang@@ yi 's willingness to serve as a service provid@@ er is more important
on 10 july , the first loc@@ ality in the country to directly select the yang@@ zi town of xin@@ du district , liu gang , accepted democratic sl@@ um@@ p for the fourth time after taking office , and the rate of satisfaction reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
in the talks between reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi defined himself as a cat@@ aly@@ st .
( yesterday 's " xin jing bao " )
liu gang - yi 's serving people may be more than those who appoint cadres on the system , and more realistic than those who serve those under the system .
the largest tu@@ mors in the system of direct election lies in the fact that the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher - level organizations , and the source of power . this determin@@ es that the former must put the responsibility to the people first .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom the decision is made are the fundamental factors for the successful candidate to carry out his work .
some people doubt such a kind of democracy , but it is more like a kind of democratic show .
my view is that there are such a kind of democratic sl@@ um@@ p , which is better than not .
considering the history and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political construction , i believe that direct public election is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this kind of democratic system , which should not be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .
india is expected to select first female presidential analy@@ st , which says it is quite likely to be elected , and female voters hope to raise women 's status

par@@ kin@@ s is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
p@@ aw@@ n is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ak@@ war@@ t comes from the opposition party 's people 's party .
because the congress party holds the advantage in the presidential election , the media and the people are all concerned about the possibility of being elected .
the 72 - year - old p@@ aw@@ ach@@ i is a female governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than state .
her lawyers , friends , and experienced in the parliament , are experienced in the parliament , and she was influ@@ enced by the government 's tu@@ jia - stan@@ i state .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural cu@@ ts and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that par@@ ach@@ ute became a candidate because she has been consistently promoted to the chair@@ man@@ ship of india 's national congress party .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has been in control of the ruling congress party for a long time .
par@@ aw@@ ah was popular with a large number of female voters , and voters believe that p@@ aw@@ n will continue to develop the image of women in india , which dis@@ crimin@@ ates against women .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is a head of state and a general administration in the name of the president . it does not represent any party organization . more importantly , it is a symb@@ ol .

the report on the adverse reaction of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es has increased substantially .
according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the number of reports on bad re@@ actions such as the heart disease triggered by the anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug , wen@@ ya , etc. , has recently increased sharply in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning last may , propos@@ ing that di@@ a@@ bet@@ es be cautious in writing , because scientists suggested in a journal " new meth@@ am@@ p@@ he@@ tam@@ ine " published on 21 may that this kind of sal@@ v@@ age drug will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of heart disease and its inci@@ d@@ ence .
therefore , wen@@ di@@ ya 's experience has received close attention from doctors and patients .
statistics show that about one month after the issue of safety warning , the us drug administration received 3@@ 57 in@@ dec@@ ent re@@ actions , of which 38 were fat@@ alities .
in january and february this year , the drug administration received only 50 and 73 bad re@@ actions reports .
these bad re@@ actions are light of the bu@@ b@@ ble and are heavy to sudden death of heart disease .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that it is still too early to reach the conclusion that di@@ a is in@@ safe .
the drug administration will hold a hearing on wen@@ di 's + sym@@ ph@@ ony on july 30 .

the us defense department re@@ considered the plan to cut down us troops in europe
a us defense department official said on 23 may that due to the changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is re@@ considering plans to cut the number of us troops stationed in europe by half .
the us media quoted an official from the defense department as saying that because the iraq war is still going on and relations between the united states , russia and iran deterior@@ ate , the defense department sets out questions on the feasibility of reducing european troops stationed there .
at that time , secretary of defense rumsfeld announced that the united states will shift the number of troops stationed in europe from originally 11.@@ 05 to 7.@@ 05 people before 20@@ 12 to build a new military with fewer but fewer troops .
at present , the total number of us troops stationed in europe and the united states has dropped to satur@@ ation .
however , in june this year , john how@@ ard , commander of the us european command , submitted a report to the current defense minister , raising questions about the plan .
the report said that while cutting military strength , many of the us troops in europe were transferred to iraq and afghanistan , resulting in shortage of personnel among us troops in europe and being unable to cooperate normally with the european allies .
the report proposes a hal@@ t to the us military plans to be stationed in europe .
according to the us experts , the above phenomenon shows that the iraq war has dr@@ ag@@ ged on for a long time to disrup@@ t the original adjustment of the us military .

the three major functions of modern army
first , the ability to identify .
different military branches and different people in different countries are different .
in the military of more than 100 countries , the use of uni@@ forms is basically the same , but no military uni@@ form of any two countries is the same .

to a certain extent , the military uni@@ form reflects the national characteristics of a country and is also the mainstay of the military professionals of a country 's military combat capability .

jing@@ jiang city 's people 's army platform upgraded the quality of cadres
the first batch of pla aviation vehicles on the eve of the " red army day " on 18 june , which was organized by lu yu@@ qing , armed forces minister of xi@@ el@@ an town , to win the psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions , was unanimously acknowledged by the cad@@ ets .
this is a unique techni@@ que that has been applied to cadres with special skills in connection with the actual conditions of their positions .
in early 2000 , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during its grass - roots investigation and study that some cadres with special skills had been appointed to posts and had not been assigned to work with armed forces .
therefore , they have adopted the method of training in concentrated form and training based on local party schools to train military cadres on regular basis , focusing on resolving the problem of lack of knowledge and uni@@ form@@ ity of professional knowledge among military cadres .
in connection with the central task , we should boldly cut down on tasks for military cadres and improve the ability to serve in military posts through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " program for appointing military cadres through competition " and clearly stipulated that the armed forces ministers must enter the party committee leading body and no longer hold other posts .
we have established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of military cadres , which is too old to meet the needs of the armed forces at the grass - roots level . we should promptly adjust and exchange cadres , and promote and use comrades with strong capabilities in comprehensive quality .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of the new century company , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water navigation technology , which has filled up domestic aw@@ l and has been upgraded to director of the armed forces department of the company .
ben@@ evol@@ ence still needs to be kind
in terms of the outcome of the competition , the score between 2 to 2 is reasonable , and also acceptable to everyone , the key is the process of the competition , and it is quite regre@@ tt@@ able .
if iran leads the 2@@ :@@ 0 , then the score will be equ@@ ated to china , then it will definitely feel different , and its morale will be very long .
the good can not be good at the end of the race , but can be said to be a old problem .
under the situation , the ball often does not take the view of ordinary people is china 's psych@@ ology .
this is indeed a cause of lack of mat@@ ches .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that it is not as good as today .
sun ji@@ hai , sun jia@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ao@@ yi and others had played ball in europe , but li wei feng and others were also veter@@ ans of the ji@@ ash@@ an field . they had a broad understanding of the situation and said that their psychological quality would not be affected .
this regre@@ tt@@ able thing has been forced to the peace by the iranian team , and probably will be directed to the deployment .
under backward conditions , the iranian team was replaced by two people , and the scene was immediately aw@@ ak@@ ened .
in the lower half of the field , three were not good .
overcome the problem of being good at the beginning and not being able to end up in good terms , we must accurately find the root cause of the problem .
if the problem is found to be correct , it is probably not difficult to find the way to correct the problem .
they were afraid of being ill and un@@ consci@@ ous of being taken to hospital .
if this goes on , competition will be more serious , and old problems will continue to emerge .
