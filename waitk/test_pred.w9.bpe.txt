experts believe that the insurance mag@@ nit@@ ude will not be diverted for domestic stock market funds in the short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by the china securities news , the " interim procedures on management of investment outside the country of insurance funds " was promulgated recently , and insurance funds have more room for use in the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's sum@@ it@@ om@@ o share@@ holding company , believes that the rmb 's appreciation and the domestic capital market are good , and that the insurance sector will not go through large - scale overseas investment in the near future , this also means that the insurance sector will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market funds from the short term .
the report says many insur@@ ers hold the same view .
experts said that since there is no such market as renminbi , the insurance organs do not have enough means to avoid risks , the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , foreign investment should have a certain proportion in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the current greater pressure on the appreciation of the rmb , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to engage in overseas investment .
in the current situation , we should treat foreign exchange purchases with cau@@ tion .

chin@@ ane@@ ws . com , july 30 chen shui - bian called on judicial personnel on the island to try to get involved in the election of leaders in the taiwan region .
the executive yuan of taiwan 's imper@@ ial court , gao jin@@ zhi , said on the same day that the present performance of the judge on the island is not in line with what chen shui - bian says and that he has asked chen shui - bian to explain his statement .
according to reports from taiwan 's " fo@@ ci , " chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's prosecu@@ tor or investig@@ ator on 30 july , because of political or election considerations , and involved in such activities , and even attempted to influence the election activities of candidates of various political parties , saying that he hoped this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , the court director of the taiwan judicial affairs council , yue yue , did not respond to the question , and secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un spoke at the supreme court of justice .
gao jin@@ zhi said that taiwan 's fundamental laws and the code of conduct of judges have declared clearly that judges should go beyond the party , that they are not allowed to take part in party activities , and that judges are very cautious about relevant restr@@ aints , and that judges believe that judges in judicial circles are very cautious .
gao jin@@ zhi pointed out that the judge of the kaohsiung high division of labor zhang xi@@ xi had attended the k@@ ad@@ ag@@ an school several years ago , that is , the decision was made to dis@@ pose of the self - discipline committee formed by the judges because the relevant courses had a political party fla@@ v@@ or .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wanted to participate in the dpp 's controver@@ sy over taking up office , and finally decided to abandon the proposal .
gao jin@@ zhi said : if it is a trial of a case , there are those at the level of trial who cannot decide the outcome of the judgment alone , then it is only a case of political int@@ ent that judges should not have their political intentions .
germany to lower the thre@@ sh@@ old for imports of professional talents
the staff headquarters of the hong kong military region ( pla ) has completed a training course for the first time since the founding of the pla .
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ av@@ a said the other day that germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in the " rules of the law " and solve the problems of specialized talent facing germany through increasing the introduction of foreign talents .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , the number of labor force from 15 to 64 will drop year by year .
if there is no enough immigrants , then the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6 % compared with the present .
but the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers ' speci@@ al@@ ised skills are greater than expected .
the german federal labor agency said that in may this year , about 80 percent of germany 's labor market engine@@ ers had suppl@@ ied food to about 1@@ 2,@@ 700 , and about 9@@ ,@@ 600 people from technicians were suppl@@ ied by technicians .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talents .
according to the german " can@@ on@@ ization " , professional personnel from non - eu countries are not able to get below 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be allowed to work and stay in germany .
the s@@ ay@@ ings suggested that this limit be lowered to the level from the hor@@ se to the earth .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously enforce laws and regulations
the " law on lawyers " amended article 8 of the draft law , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval , stipulates that those who have engaged in legal studies , such as teaching , and who have a high degree of professional skills , such as those who apply for the lawyers ' work , and who have applied for the lawyers ' work , are subject to examination and approval by the judicial administration department of the state council , and are allowed to practi@@ se in their profession .
( 28 june " china 's " )
in the law , there are theories and theories of different levels and the lim@@ it@@ ations of actual affairs , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , etc. , while the latter is more often engaged in specific behaviors such as legal li@@ tig@@ ation , legal consultation , legal services , etc.
for a long time , there has been a trend of the phenomenon of people being blin@@ dly different from the auth@@ ors , and the theory of the marxist theory has maintained that the lack of necessary foo@@ d@@ stuf@@ fs is only the result of mechan@@ ized law - based mon@@ og@@ o@@ ism , and the fact that the theory of the theoretical circle of the marxist circle is not a theory of practice .
the law can do what is to maintain the difference of division of labor , and it is not to support any side with its own support .
however , the " law of lawyers " has obj@@ ectively recognized the scientific theory of law , which is more important than the legal system , and is more important than the law 's judgment of the actual situation .
in fact , some p@@ ure theoretical studies and teaching methods such as the international law of legal system are very deep - rooted and are also related to legal practice .
in this way , the mag@@ nit@@ ude of the law was undoubtedly a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy in legal affairs , and it was a bad mou@@ th that had an extremely poor impact .
the lack of confidence in theory is not limited to these , such as experts ' argu@@ ments and argu@@ ments will often affect or even rej@@ ect court judg@@ ments , and are also direct manif@@ est@@ ations of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain reduc@@ es terrorist attack
on july 5 , the reporter learned from london ( by staff reporter guo lin )
the british government reduced the sc@@ al@@ es of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the serious level , which indicated that the terrorist attacks in britain would not happen , but the attack was still extremely likely to be .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested for terrorist attacks were working in the medical system , and the government will have a clear and thorough examination of the background of the in@@ coming immigrants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that there are nearly one person working in the british public health care system who has obtained medical qualifications overseas .
the prime minister also asked for an investigation into the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and the employers or relevant agencies would be required to provide background information .
do n't let the business operators get imp@@ ati@@ ent .
the m@@ ang@@ a tourism char@@ t is a relaxed and fresh bre@@ e@@ ze that is self - conce@@ ived , and to the greatest extent it enjoys the fruits of natural civilization and social civilization .
but in china , many people have suffered such a kind of worry , and they are being taken to the ch@@ ase of the business deal@@ ers and intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is cars or tr@@ ains , and when you go up , you will always be hit by the sm@@ i@@ th of small traders and some un@@ qualified intermedi@@ aries .
it was not a pe@@ an@@ u@@ t of the pe@@ king of the pe@@ an@@ u@@ t journal , and then many other un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ aries introduced cat@@ ering , and even the fake certificate of birth .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and if you are most un@@ successful , you will be a good person .
in some scen@@ ery , many of them have the same feeling .
if the door is not opened , some people will be tou@@ ched on the same bre@@ ath and the little bit of the water .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more , and the good y@@ aw@@ xing will also be sti@@ r@@ red up and un@@ scr@@ up@@ ul@@ ous .
some media reports said that many foreign tourists who went to xi@@ '@@ an were not at all surpris@@ ed at the mon@@ ument of xi@@ '@@ an , but they were un@@ understand@@ able about allowing many small business haw@@ kers who had been re@@ ac@@ ked to go to the site .
these include the or@@ ang@@ e of the stations , the original , the place of the river , and the place where the wind is in the shape of civilization , the stability and harmony , and the natural gas of a natural gas le@@ af .
the free - and - mou@@ th of the deal@@ ers was conf@@ used , and they obj@@ ectively under@@ min@@ ed these public order , caused pollution and environmental pollution , and also provided conditions and opportunities for the products .
what is important is that these are the window for the construction of local spiritual civilization , and the pan@@ ic is a gl@@ u@@ t that is damaged not only by the image , but also will have an impact on the local economic development .
let me think , if you want to make the tourism industry strong , you can use this chao@@ tic and m@@ ess tourism environment to welcome the guests coming from south to north . who will come and who will dare come ?
how do you obtain benefits from your tourism economy ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourism environment for tourists from the southern and northern parts of the world . it should be said that the most urgent task is to be done .
the market is not the market , the operation of small business haw@@ kers should be standardized , and those without license must be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only a civilized and orderly environment can make one feel happy , be prosperous , and be re@@ born .
in one word , let the traders worry .
the spirit of the times and the spirit of the times are very great .
the construction of dong@@ cheng district in beijing is an active duty for 12 households to be re@@ funded with their own use of electric power and other materials .
( " xin@@ jing bao " on 10 july )
i am pleased to see the improvement of the family 's life , but i still have some kind of experience in re@@ treating from the original policies of the party and the policy of re@@ war@@ ding others with their own initiative .
deputy director of the jian@@ feng neighbor@@ hood office said that in view of such problems as fraud and low - guarantee , encouraging the active re@@ fund of the security system is an example for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income insur@@ ers to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if we want to see those who have been dece@@ ived for a long time to obtain low - income people from their pl@@ ight , it is not as n@@ ai@@ ve as well .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up the de@@ fici@@ encies of individual households , the law is the most important .
the departments concerned should strengthen the responsibility of low - income insurance households in enjoying the minimum guarantee : if they promptly report the changes in family personnel and income , report the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , the departments concerned should increase the intensity of supervision and inspection .
after all , the strategy of re@@ treating from the dev@@ il according to law is a long - term one .
the street re@@ wards the family with the help of the re@@ insurance family , who is the one who is the p@@ air of the re@@ insurance policy ?
as a first - level government organization , the expenditures are borne by the financial appropri@@ ations .
the tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be used ?
on the one hand , with@@ drawing from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency ability , and on the other hand , are those who apply for low - income insurance still present ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ations , known as the saving money , should provide disaster relief in the s@@ now@@ y weather , not add flowers to the br@@ igh@@ test .
liu said that he was willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first public election in the country , the le@@ gen@@ d liu yu@@ yi of the new du@@ tch district , was given a democratic appointment for the fourth time since he took office . the rate of satisfaction reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the dialogue between the reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu gang@@ yi posi@@ tioned himself as a serv@@ er .
( yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " )
liu 's ta@@ o@@ ist may be more than the one who appointed cadres to the rank of cadres , and the one who really has a real chance to make people feel more true .
the biggest difference between the appointment system and the direct election is that the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members , while the latter is mainly by the higher - level organization , and the source of power determine the orientation of the former , which must put the responsibility for the people first .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom are the fundamental factors that determine how the elected person will carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned such a kind of democracy and my@@ ster@@ y , like a kind of democratic show .
my view is that there are such a kind of democratic and p@@ ure form , which is better than it is .
in consideration of the history and present situation of the building of grass - roots democracy in china , i believe that direct election by public promo@@ tions is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this kind of mag@@ nit@@ ude , and it is imper@@ mis@@ sible to under@@ estimate the promotion of the building of grass - roots democracy .

p@@ aw@@ n is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze comes from the opposition party people 's party .
because the congress party holds a dominant position in the presidential election , the media and the people are quite different about the possibility of being elected .
the 72 - year - old p@@ av@@ ol is the female governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than .
she has a p@@ air of lawyers , a unique experience in the parliament , and she was welcomed by the government while she was in office as governor of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than state .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural and educational soci@@ e@@ ties .
analysts pointed out that par@@ agu@@ ay became a candidate because she had been unswervingly concerned about the fact that s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi , chairman of the national congress party of india .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has been in control of the ruling national congress .
p@@ aw@@ n was given the support of a large number of female voters , and female voters believed that par@@ agu@@ ay would dis@@ crimin@@ ate against the image of women in india as a mag@@ ic weapon and raise the position of women .

two jord@@ anian men sentenced for planning attacks on americans
two jord@@ anian men were arrested on 11 november after being sentenced by the jordan national security court for planning an attack on americans in jordan .
the two men , both aged 25 , were a man named su@@ z@@ uk@@ i s@@ ab@@ ah and hu@@ tal@@ e , who were sentenced to eight years ' imprisonment plus a compulsory labor service , and another person , mor@@ e@@ a , was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment plus a compulsory labor service .
the court sources said that hu@@ tal@@ e was also charged with illegal possession of the du@@ b@@ ious tam@@ il , and the police found a revol@@ ver when sear@@ ching his sp@@ an@@ i@@ ards .
the court had originally decided to sent@@ encing hu ta@@ ol@@ i to life , and later considered giving him a chance to make a change of hor@@ se and a sl@@ ight loss of eight years .
the indic@@ t@@ ment said that the two defend@@ ants had decided to make a contribution to those who suffered humili@@ ation from the americans and humili@@ ated the mus@@ lim@@ s ' enemies after the outbreak of the iraq war , and then planned to attack americans living in jordan .
in august 2006 , they named one of the american living in an@@ man , the capital of jordan , but were arrested by the police before they attacked him .
the indic@@ t@@ ment did not make public the identity of the american .
the indic@@ t@@ ment also accused the two defend@@ ants of planning to attack other americans but did not reve@@ al details .
the united states and japan held a joint press conference on the morning of 5 february .
the report on the adverse effects of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drugs , wen@@ di , has increased by a large margin .
according to a report by the us media on the 15th , the number of reports on bad re@@ actions such as heart disease caused by anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , wen@@ di , has recently risen sharply in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting that di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients be careful in writing because scientists published research reports in the 21 st may edition of the " new gen@@ e@@ tic journal " , saying that this kind of marketing drug will greatly increase the patient 's car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar rate and its inci@@ d@@ ence .
the doctor and the patient are closely watching the nu@@ tr@@ iti@@ ous nu@@ is@@ ances of wen@@ di .
statistics revealed that the number of us drug companies received a total of 3@@ 57 ver@@ bal warnings about a month after the issuance of the security warning , of which 38 were dead .

these bad re@@ actions were ligh@@ tly so@@ aking up , and they were seriously killed by sudden heart attack .
however , the drug expert of the us pharmaceutical administration believes that it is still too early to reach an agreement on dis@@ ney in@@ security .
the pharm@@ acy and pois@@ ons board will hold hear@@ ings on july 30 on wen@@ di 's bi@@ ya 's gen@@ e@@ tic .
in 1999 , the emperor 's writing dis@@ ney was a pan@@ cre@@ as@@ onic that increased the ag@@ ent of the insul@@ in and applied to treating the di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
there are about 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es in the world who have taken or are taking wen@@ di@@ y@@ l@@ ic .
the p@@ end@@ el@@ e gr@@ os@@ s@@ k , britain 's found@@ er , has always believed that wen@@ di@@ y@@ ah is safe and that the benefits for patients are greater than dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cies .

the us department of defense re@@ considered the plan to cut us military forces in europe
a us defense department official said on 23 july that due to changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us department of defense is re@@ considering the plan to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .
the us media quoted a defense department official as saying that because the iraq war is still going on and relations between the united states , russia and iran are wor@@ s@@ ening , the defense department has raised doubts about the feasibility of reducing the european military forces .
at that time , us secretary of defense rumsfeld announced that the united states would increase the number of troops stationed in europe from the original 11 - person to the 7 - person to the present level by 20@@ 12 , in order to build a new type of military with low - temper@@ ed ones .
at present , the total number of us troops stationed in europe and the united states has dropped to the level of the people 's liberation army .
however , in june this year , us military european command commander pe@@ ter do@@ k submitted a report to the current defense secretary , asking about the above reduction plan .
the report said that while cutting military strength , many of the us troops stationed in europe were transferred to iraq and afghanistan , resulting in a shortage of us personnel in europe and being unable to cooperate with its european allies .
the report suggested that the us military plan to cut down on its troops stationed in europe be stopped .
relevant us experts believe that the above phenomena show that the iraq war has been a prolonged mal@@ ign@@ ant act of the original us military adjustment plan .
the united states and japan should strengthen cooperation in the area of energy conservation and environmental protection .

different branches of the armed forces and the people of different countries are different important symb@@ ols .
in the military forces of more than 100 countries in the world , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , there is no uni@@ form of the armed forces of any two countries .

the brigade also cle@@ ared several times the house , and it could not get through because of various resistance , making this problem a big and difficult one .

the chinese military is a guest of design@@ ers of military uni@@ forms .
the reporter learned from the general staff headquarters that the pla units have been conducting the first - phase training of the " 2007 " anti - terrorism military exercise since 1 august .
tonight , the chinese military network specially invited the deputy director of the armament department of the armed forces department chen jun and senior engine@@ er of the military equipment institute of military equipment research on military uni@@ forms , su su , a guest of the chinese military net , and the background and process of the development of new military uni@@ forms of ne@@ tiz@@ ens at home and abroad . this has ev@@ o@@ ked an e@@ ul@@ og@@ y among ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the direct cur@@ ta@@ iling of the design of the 2007 military uni@@ form .
on the changes in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the 07 - style military uni@@ form is particularly the base of the 97 - type military uni@@ form , and the series of uni@@ form - type uni@@ form - shap@@ ed forms and seven other aspects have been improved as many as several hundred .
the most important characteristic of the 07 - style uni@@ form is that it reflects the requirements of the style of le@@ op@@ ard and human@@ ity , and for the first time it has reached the standards of the three armed services ' coordinated bre@@ eds , and the series of supporting systems , thus marking a historic leap in the level of building the military uni@@ form .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new military varie@@ ties of the new type of the ne@@ tiz@@ ens , such as the new type of the ne@@ ur@@ ons , the new type of the ne@@ tiz@@ ens .

jing@@ jiang city 's people 's armed forces platform improv@@ es cadre quality
in a report by reporter cao jia@@ quan and zhu chun@@ bin , a group of cadres from jiangsu 's jing@@ jiang city on 18 june were invited to give lectures on " winning inform@@ ati@@ zed warfare " by lu yu@@ qing , minister of armed forces in jiangsu 's jing@@ jiang city . the students participating in the training were unanimously commended .
this is a major strategic measure taken by the armed forces department to put pressure on cadres by taking into consideration the actual conditions of their posts and to improve the comprehensive quality of cadres with special skills .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department found out during the investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some cadres with special skills had served as a cadre , and had not devoted their main energy to the armed work .
for this reason , they adopted the method of concentrated training , using the method of training by local party schools , and so on , to train cadres with special skills on a regular basis , and to strive to solve the problem of a single - min@@ de@@ dness of professional knowledge among cadres with special skills .
in light of the central task , they boldly delivered tasks to military cadres , and through their work posts , they improved their abilities in their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " plan for appointing cadres with the special force " and explicitly stipulated that the minister of the armed forces must enter the party committee leading body and no longer hold other posts .
and established a mechanism for the cadres to adjust and exchange , which has a bearing on the work of arming the people at the grass - roots level .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of the new century 's war@@ saw company , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to innovate in the development of under@@ water vessels , filled up domestic rad@@ ars and was promoted to the minister of the armed forces of the company .
the beginning of the good will still be good .
the two - to - two ratio is reasonable and also one can accept the result of the competition . the key is the process of the competition , and how many people feel regret .
if the iranian team is the second - largest in the world , then the b@@ ar will be equ@@ ated , then the feeling of china 's mag@@ nit@@ ude will be very long , its morale will be very strong , and its situation is opposite .
the first thing is not good at the end of the game , and it can be said that it is a p@@ ure problem .
it is often under the situation of the situation that people will not play , and the views of ordinary people are the un@@ t@@ ough@@ ness of china 's psychological quality .
this is indeed a reason why one can not feel the mag@@ nan@@ im@@ ity and the lack of sincerity .
however , from the perspective of the contest today , it seems un@@ ending .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ao@@ zhi , zheng zhi , and others did not say anything about the ball in europe . li wei - feng and others were old men in the s@@ and field . they saw the many things they saw and said that they would not have any problem in terms of psychological quality .
this regre@@ tt@@ able act was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was probably due to the deployment of troops in the dar@@ kn@@ ess .
the iranian team , under a back@@ war@@ dness , was changed to two , and the scene was immediately e@@ ased .
in the second half , three were changed , but the results were not good .
overcome the problems of being good at the beginning and being unable to end well , we must accurately find the root cause of the problem .
if problems are found , it is not difficult to find any way to change the way of doing away with the problem .
they are afraid that they will be thr@@ own into hospital if they are ill .
if this goes on , it will be too late to k@@ ick off more mat@@ ches , and old problems will still be made .

according to a report by the venezuel@@ an media on 3 november , the 37 - year - old old man k@@ el@@ ler said in an interview that if the american cup could not find a suitable club after the race , he would choose to reti@@ re .
if the u@@ . s cup fin@@ ishes four to six weeks after the conclusion of the match , i still cannot obtain a contract of a high level of the one - two cre@@ ations , then retirement may be my wrong choice .
with the fall of the xing - la - b@@ ach@@ er team into germany , k@@ el@@ er also left this two - plus - one - star team that has its own power .

however , this young male who has served the mag@@ ic of the western ch@@ as@@ m 's su@@ i@@ yuan and germany 's mon@@ ument said that his final choice will depend on the family , the children of my chil@@ d@@ hood who are still ven@@ us , and he has been with me in three different countries , and three schools . my current choice is to consider how to be more favorable to my family .
in the gold cup not long ago , k@@ el@@ der played an outstanding role and helped the team win the champion@@ ship .
he was still the head co@@ ach of br@@ ad@@ ley , who was awarded the responsibility for the current american cup , but n@@ ai@@ he was the hard - to - face enemy , and the young ne@@ u@@ ba - the sw@@ ing - out team was not the most powerful oppon@@ ent of argentina 's ba@@ is@@ hu , and the two mat@@ ches he held were wearing seven times .
the next match against colom@@ bia is very likely to be a match between the two teams in the current american cup .
