experts said that since there is no single renminbi market at present , insurance institutions are not suffici@@ ently capable of ev@@ ading risks , the tim@@ ing for large - scale purchase of foreign exchange is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , investment abroad should be within the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the current great pressure of appreciation of the rmb , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
the government will also conduct a survey on foreign exchange purchase and investment in the country .

the report of this newspaper , ber@@ lin , 1 july ( reporter wang huai@@ cheng )
german education minister sh@@ au@@ k@@ at s@@ ay@@ a said recently that germany should lower its " capitalist law " and impose restrictions on foreign professionals . by increasing their input into foreign countries , germany should solve the problem of professional talent .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany is 15 to 64 years old , and the number of labor will decrease year by year .
if there is no sufficient em@@ igr@@ ation , germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6 percent compared to the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers are relatively strong .
the german labor agency said that the german labor market was expected to increase by 2@@ -@@ 3 percent in may this year , compared with 1@@ -@@ 2 - million in 1994 .
in order to protect their own employment , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for bringing in foreign talent .
the german " tro@@ i@@ ka law " stipulates that non - eu countries ' professionals are not in favor of the euro in germany , unless they are allowed to work in germany and have residence permit .
sha wan suggested reducing this limit to the present of the euro .
we should not blin@@ dly stick to the theory of super@@ sti@@ tion and law .
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval , stipulates that professional work , such as teaching by law , and who has a senior professional standard , such as either advanced or similar , and who has applied for the law enforcement profession , may be approved by the judicial administrative department of the state council and be granted to the law enforcement agency .
( " china 's bre@@ ast " ) " 28 june
in the legal field , there are theoretical circles and the bound@@ aries of the real - world business , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and the latter are mostly engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , legal services , and other specific behavior .
for a long time , the legal circles have developed and developed the legal system , and the legal system has developed side by side .
the division of labor is not a matter of legal importance .
however , the " law of lawyers " contains a single - handed legal system , which obj@@ ectively recogn@@ izes the inherent law and the inherent law .
in fact , some people engaged in the theory of the legal system , international laws , and other purely research and teaching , and their theoretical origin@@ s are also closely related to the law .
in this way , the legal status of the legal status of the western monopoly industry has undoubtedly opened a very bad state of the legal status .
we must not be blin@@ dly optimistic about the theoretical circles , but rather have super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous ideas , such as experts and scholars , will often affect the phenomenon of rej@@ ecting court decisions , and will also directly manif@@ est this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers terrorist attack
london , 5 jul ( wen wei po ) -- on 5 july ,
the british government has cut its hor@@ se level from the highest level to the serious side , and this indicates that the terrorist attacks in britain will not break out , but the attacks are still extremely likely .
british police are now investigating the case to india and australia .
the eight terrorists arrested were all detained in the medical system , and the government would conduct a comprehensive investigation on the background of in@@ coming immigrants working in the medical system .
it is learned that nearly one - third of the people working in the british public medical system are qualified to get medical treatment overseas .
the prime minister also called for setting up a framework for high - tech immigrants , and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide information on the background of this .
do n't let the business people get imp@@ ati@@ ent .
the tourism map is a sl@@ ack of the bottom of the ocean and the natural be@@ ings of the society are enjoyed to the greatest extent .
it can travel in china , and many people have encountered such worry . in the final game , the bel@@ t is surr@@ ounded and pursued by the sel@@ lers and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
whether it is a car or a train , the upper parts of the car will always be run by small deal@@ ers and some intermedi@@ ary organs without license .
it is not a selling out of the bre@@ ast of the bre@@ ast , that is , selling newspapers and magaz@@ ines , and then introducing many without - license intermedi@@ ary parts , even using false information , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , then you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some areas , many things are also equally felt .
if you do not enter the gate , someone will come from the bottom of the ocean and the small , the things .
after entering the gate , this situation is even more , and if the good y@@ ax@@ ing is also conf@@ used , it will be bl@@ amed for the situation .
there was a media report that many foreign tourists in xian were extremely un@@ happy about the mon@@ arch@@ y in xian , but they were not allowed to have more pe@@ t pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ kers .
these include the wind@@ ows of the wind and the wind , which are the same as the past and the present , and the areas in which the wind bel@@ ts and the wind bel@@ t are all developed in an orderly and harmonious manner , and provide a qu@@ iet and qu@@ iet environment .
the freedom of the commercial and sales businesses has been conf@@ used and not to mention the sligh@@ test worry . obj@@ ectively , they have under@@ min@@ ed the public order of these kinds and formed the pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , they have provided conditions and opportunities for the appearance of these things .
what is important is that these are the wind@@ ows and g@@ aps for the building of the local spiritual civilization , and the damaged ones are not just an image issue , but will also have an impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a strong tourist industry , you use this kind of ir@@ regular tourist environment to welcome the guests from the south and the north , who will dare to come ?
your tourism economy can achieve results ?
as tourism is coming , it will bring a large number of tourist attr@@ actions to the north of the tian@@ nan area .
it is not market , and the operation of pe@@ t haw@@ ker should be standardized , and the business without license should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment can allow the people to be happy and to return to the motherland , and be re@@ born .
in one word , it is not easy to let the business deal@@ ers come .
the award of the honor of the party on its own initiative
the construction of the dong@@ cheng district in beijing has used the issuance of electric sh@@ o@@ e and other products as a re@@ war@@ ding to 12 households who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed their houses .
( " xin jing bao " ) 10 july
this writ@@ er has felt happy about the improvement of family life , but has taken the initiative to keep the upper hand , and has also adopted the method of giving awards to the poor , but this is a complex m@@ ood .
deputy director of the ji@@ ao@@ ji neighbor@@ hood office said that , in view of the problem of dec@@ eption and protection , encouraging active re@@ im@@ bur@@ sement is the model for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - security personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from the predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it is to stimulate the long - term che@@ ating of low - security personnel , it is not easy to be inf@@ ant .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clearance of low - income households , more reliance is on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the management of the minimum guarantee for the minimum allow@@ able income of households to be performed by the households concerned : if they promptly report on the changes in the family members and income , report on the employment situation , and accept re@@ examination on a regular basis , the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , only by returning from the rule of law will it be a long - term plan .
the street will be closed for re@@ payment of the pen@@ sion given to the families who have been given a single item .
as a first - level government organization , the street 's expenditure is borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
and tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the number of households with@@ drawing from the low - security system prov@@ es that they have the ability to independently control themselves and that on the other hand , are those applying for low - security personnel not still present ?
the money - saving government has to be called a don@@ ation fund , and should be sent in the snow , instead of a golden fl@@ ower .

on 10 july , the first public - promotion town , named mas@@ an@@ u , was un@@ popular in the new gu@@ i@@ yang district , the fourth time since taking office , has accepted democracy and achieved a high rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
when reporters met with liu con@@ g - yi , liu con@@ g - yi was identified as a play@@ er .
( the " xin jing bao " yesterday )
liu con@@ yi 's bel@@ ly service may be more than some of the cadres appointed by the system , and may be more true than those who appointed cadres .
compared with the system of directly - elected appointment , the most important thing is that the former is the power source determined by ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power , and the former has decided that the former must be held in the first place to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom to be held responsible are the fundamental factors determining how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people doubt the democratic character of this kind , like a single piece of democratic show .
my view is that there is such a democratic form of state , which is better than it .
considering the fact that china 's grassroots democratic political construction is in the process of being carried out in a direct manner , i believe that the open - door election is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component . it should not be under@@ estimated to promote the building of grass - roots democratic politics .
india is expected to elect the first female president analysts to be elected , while female voters hope to raise their status as women .
on 23 june , par@@ ou@@ ting was in front of the presidential candidate document .
the cur@@ tain of the indian presidential election was raised on 19 april . the new president will re@@ sign in the presidential election after current vice president sh@@ au@@ k@@ at car@@ at and former president of the la@@ j@@ as@@ at state rich@@ ard par@@ agu@@ ay .
the mas@@ an@@ jia is the first female presidential candidate in the history of india . if she is elected , she will become the first female president of india .
par@@ ag@@ i@@ ang is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , and sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ n@@ ad@@ ze comes from the opposition people 's party .
because the national congress party occup@@ ies a dominant position in the presidential election group , the media and the public are all very likely to win the election .
p@@ ag@@ er , 72 , is a female governor of the state of j@@ as@@ ar@@ as@@ ar@@ i .
she 's a b@@ ar , and her experience is very rich in her own hands when she was the leader of the ra@@ j@@ as@@ than b@@ ang .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and she was a member of the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural institutions and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why par@@ ame@@ ters became a candidate is because she always stands at the side of india 's national congress party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the g@@ and@@ hi cl@@ an has long controlled the ruling national congress party .
par@@ ag@@ i@@ be@@ a was supported by a large number of female voters . the female voters believe that par@@ it@@ on is dis@@ crimin@@ ating against the female population 's serious concept of mon@@ str@@ al indian women and elev@@ ating the status of women .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is the head of state and the head of state in the name of the president , and does not represent any party organization , and more is a symb@@ ol .

two jord@@ anian people were arrested for plo@@ tting attacks on americans
two jord@@ anian men arrested for plo@@ tting attacks on the americans in jordan were sentenced by the jordan national security court on 11 november .
the two men , aged 25 , were a bab@@ y girl .
the court said that ho@@ tar@@ ar was also charged with illegally holding the stick , and police discovered a motor@@ ized inf@@ an@@ try gun when sear@@ ching for him .
the court had decided to sentence hu - ri to life imprisonment , and later considered a single chance to change his predic@@ ament to him for eight years .
the indic@@ t@@ ment said that the two defend@@ ants decided to provide financial assistance to those americans who suffered humili@@ ation and humili@@ ation after the outbreak of the iraq war , and therefore planned to attack the americans living in jordan .
in august 2006 , they caught a female soldier named an@@ man@@ e in the capital of jordan , but after the attacks they had been arrested by the police .
there was no open letter of apology from the american people .

the incident caused bad re@@ actions in the number of reports .
according to a report by the us media on 15 june , the adverse re@@ actions of the disease , such as the heart disease caused by the anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , have recently shown a sharp up@@ ward trend in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to be cautious with the approach of using the bi@@ ble as , because scientists published a research report on the " new drug journal " published on 21 may , saying that this gl@@ ov@@ e@@ ta@@ il dis@@ h@@ es will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of the heart disease and the growth rate of the patients .
wen di 's influence was therefore influ@@ enced by the medical and patients .
the statistics show that about one month after the issue of safety warnings , the us pharmaceutical authority received 3@@ 57 examples of mal@@ ign@@ ant re@@ actions , of which 38 were the death reports .
in january and february this year , the p@@ m@@ b received only 50 and 73 cases of non - performing reaction .

the three major themes of modern military service
first , the identification function .
the difference between different countries ' armed forces and the important h@@ all@@ marks of the people of different services and arms .
in the world , the number of troops in more than 100 countries is basically the same , but there are no two countries ' armed forces .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are the most distinc@@ tive national character of a country and are also the most important component of the combat capability of a country 's armed forces .
in the uni@@ qu@@ ely dres@@ sed , the three major military uni@@ forms are the most capable of showing the military power , the st@@ ars , the th@@ ro@@ es of the united states , and the dres@@ s .
third , the function of protection .
along with the rapid development of new and high - tech weaponry , the new - type comprehensive protective performance of the new - type combat uni@@ forms has made the uni@@ forms of the armed forces have the capability of guarding against and preventing the appearance of the le@@ gen@@ d from the h@@ em@@ p , and the multi@@ pl@@ ying functions of the th@@ in - bre@@ ast pol@@ es , etc. , the military uni@@ form has become the most important issue in the development of military uni@@ form .

a few years ago , as the personnel of this group 's family building was illegally par@@ tially occupied , the number of houses of cadres working in the army was relatively difficult .

only by d@@ aring to be true and not being able to resolve difficult problems can we solve .
the new party committee leadership group reached a consensus , and the principal leaders personally took the lead in clearing up all the problems of un@@ authorized occupation of houses .
on the one hand , they are moving forward and are eager to get rid of the situation , hoping that relevant personnel will understand the policies and regulations related to the military 's ar@@ sen@@ al and the application of the economic housing , and show the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand .

the two countries , regardless of their international affairs or their national construction , have mutual trust and support , and have closely cooper@@ ated with each other .
china appreciates and thanks banglad@@ esh for its support and assistance to china on the issues of taiwan 's human rights and tibet .
qiao qing@@ chen said that the chinese armed forces treasure their friendly relations with the banglad@@ esh armed forces , and hope that with the joint efforts of the two sides , the friendly cooperation between the two armed forces will be further expanded , and the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the air forces of the two countries will be strengthened to a new level .

the 2007 - 01 - style military uni@@ form design@@ ate is a guest of the china military net .
beijing , 13 jul ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- yang bao@@ jin , deputy director of the general logistics department of the pla , will be wearing a 7 - type military uni@@ form on 1 august .
this evening , the chinese military website specially invited military materials to be imported from russia , which were taken by chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and su jian - yang , senior engine@@ er of the military equipment research institute , as the first - generation military uni@@ form design@@ ate , to be born with military and civilian friends both inside and outside the military .
the two guests are mr john mas@@ se , a seven - style military uni@@ form design .
speaking of the changes in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the 2007 - style military uni@@ form is born in the hand@@ ba@@ g of the united states , especially the 97 - style military uni@@ form , and it is the seven - way improvement in the uni@@ form series , including the uni@@ form series , that is , as many as several hundred items .
the most important characteristic of the 7 - style military uni@@ form is that it embodies the inherent characteristics of the evol@@ ution of the military uni@@ form , and it enables the military uni@@ form to reach the standard for coordinating the three services for the first time , indicating that the level of the army 's uni@@ form construction has achieved a historical leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the species of new military uni@@ forms , the appearance of the cel@@ esti@@ al tra@@ p , and other issues with net friends .
this bel@@ l was built by the china military network and the china internet .
the deputy chief of the staff of jing@@ jiang city 's armed forces has upgraded the quality of the cadres .
the pla navy 's first artillery corps , which was established in jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , has caught up in the hands of armed police chiefs from west l@@ ai@@ zhen , who are attending the " training class under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions , " and has received unanim@@ ous approval from the train@@ ees on 18 june .
this is the most important political task that the armed forces department has exer@@ ted efforts to upgrade the overall quality of the armed forces cadres in light of the reality of their posts .
early this year , the party committee of the armed forces department discovered during a study at the grass - roots level that some military cadres were in the lead and were in the same position , and did not concentrate their energ@@ ies on armed work .
to this end , they adopted the method of concentr@@ ating on training and training in local party schools , and conducted regular training on specialized arms cadres , and worked hard to solve the problem of un@@ it@@ ary professional quality of military cadres .
in connection with the central work , we should boldly hand over the burden of the armed forces to the top , and improve our ability to work in the posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments to jointly formulate the " program for appointing full - arms cadres through competition , " which clearly stipulates that the armed forces minister must enter the leading body and not hold other posts ;
established a system for readjusting and exchanging military cadres , and made a comprehensive assessment of some special - purpose cadres who are not adap@@ ted to the work of arming the armed forces at the grass - roots level in a timely manner , and were promoted to use them with strong overall quality .
not long ago , the new century 's development company director chen yi@@ song led the militi@@ a technology elements to innovate and develop under@@ water ships .
the good will start will be good .
the result of the competition alone is 2 - 2 , which is reasonable and also the goal that can be accepted . the key is the process of the competition , and the extent of regre@@ tt@@ able .
if iran 's team is 2 - 0 , then the equ@@ ator will be equ@@ ated , then it will certainly be different to china , and it will be very strong .
good will not end up well . it can be said that it is a bad old problem .
the situation is often under the condition of the situation , and the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not up to the mark .
this is indeed a kind of " taiwan independence " which can not be achieved without the sligh@@ test sl@@ um@@ p .
however , from today 's competition , it seems that it is not the end .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ yun , and gao yan , who were born in europe , did not say that li wei - feng and others were also the old lad@@ ies of the ji@@ ao@@ feng . they have seen the broad masses of the people and do not have any problem with their psychological quality .
this regret has been forced into the he@@ els of the iranian team because it is afraid that the deployment will be carried out .
iran 's team , in a backward condition , changed the two men , and the scene immediately got the pul@@ se .
in the second half of the game , the results were not good .
to overcome the problem of being good at beginning but not in the end , we must find the root of the problem .
as long as the problem is accurately identified and the methods to change the problem are not difficult to find .
i am afraid that i will take medicine in a chao@@ tic situation .
if this goes on , it will be a game of more than a game , and old problems will still be made , and it will not be possible to talk about the k@@ ick that everyone is exp@@ ecting .
