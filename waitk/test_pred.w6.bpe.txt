experts believe that the appearance of insurance = bre@@ eds domestic financial problems will not be diverted in the short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures on managing overseas investment of insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for using capital markets .
the chief investment officer of the chinese company of hon@@ da , liu le@@ fei , believes that the appreciation of the renminbi and the favorable trend of the domestic capital market will not be realized in the short term of the re@@ valuation of the overseas investment , which also means that the investment of insurance officials in china will not be diverted to the stock market funds within the short term .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that since there is no market for rmb products , the insurance organs have not enough means to avoid risks , and the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : over the long term , foreign investment in the asset allocation should play a certain role in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the greater pressure of the re@@ valuation of the rmb , china 's chu@@ ang will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
as for foreign exchange purchases , under the current circumstances , it is necessary to be cautious in dealing with them .

chen shui - bian secre@@ tly criticized the government for inter@@ v@@ ening in the election of the taiwan " judicial yuan " and denied and wanted to explain it .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , han@@ te chen , july 30 - questi@@ oned the judicial personnel on the island who attempted to get involved in the election of leaders in taiwan 's region .
taiwan 's superior judicial department , feng zhi@@ zhi , said on the same day that the current performance of taiwan 's judges is not in line with chen shui - bian 's words , and asked chen shui - bian to give an explanation to his statement .
according to a report by taiwan 's " ying@@ chi , " judge or investig@@ ator chen shui - bian [ chen shuibian ] interven@@ ed in a show@@ down or even attempted to influence candidates of various parties because of political or election considerations , saying that he hoped this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but that it might be very difficult .

germany to lower thre@@ sh@@ old for introduction of professionals
xinhua news agency , july 1 , ber@@ lin , by reporter huai@@ cheng wang
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ w@@ ang@@ wan said a few days ago that germany should lower the restrictions on the introduction of foreign professionals in its " law " , and solve the problem of professional personnel facing germany by increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's population of tw@@ el@@ ve to 64 years old will decrease year after year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , to 20@@ -@@ 00 , german labor will be reduced by 6 percent .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that engine@@ ers ' professional skills are greater in germany 's current labor market .
according to the statistics of the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , the supply of some 12@@ 0,000 german engine@@ ers in the labor market was approximately 10,000 , and the supply of some 2,@@ 7@@ 600 technicians was about 9@@ ,@@ 600 .
to protect their own people 's employment , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting foreign talent .
germany 's " abr@@ og@@ ation law " stipulates that professional personnel from non - eu countries are not inferior to germany 's 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot obtain permission to work and stay in germany .
sh@@ ali@@ k@@ ov suggested that the limit be lowered to the ratio of the euro to the euro .
people who practice super@@ sti@@ tion of laws
the draft " law on lawyers , " which has been submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : law professor li zhaoxing , who has engaged in professional work such as law research , and who has the same professional standard as a senior diplom@@ at , who has applied for a law@@ yer 's practice , may be granted approval to the law enforcement agency after examination and approval by the judicial administrative department of the state council .
( " china 's automobile " on 28 june )
legal theories are the same as those of the chinese communists , as well as those of the l@@ ust , the former , as well as the m@@ ai@@ den act of law and the latter , are more involved in such specific acts as legal consul@@ ting and service in li@@ tig@@ ation .
for a long time , theoretical circle and practical affairs exist among literary circles , which are the phenomena of the chinese communists , which are the ones who are engaged in practical work , and which are the essential needs of the chinese army 's current affairs , are only the mechan@@ ized legal principles , but the most critical point of the chinese communists ' criticism of the chinese theoretical circle is their theoretical guidance .
for such differences in division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain , not to support , any party .
however , the appearance of our laws as a prof@@ ile of our gener@@ ous att@@ or@@ ney system has obj@@ ectively recognized the higher the law than the law 's judg@@ ement .
in fact , some international law enforcement and other purely studies and teaching activities , such as the history of international legal system , have yet again become more profound theories than legal practice .
in this way , the pat@@ ri@@ ar@@ ch is undoubtedly a matter of the status of legal profession as a matter of fact , a situation that aff@@ ects the reputation of the legal profession is extremely bad .
the people of the theoretical circle , such as experts and experts , have often influ@@ enced and even ve@@ to@@ ed the court verdic@@ t , and this is also a direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain to reduce terrorist attacks
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 , by reporter lin guo
british government 's terror attack ranks down from the highest level to the rank of serious zhao@@ shu , indicating that the terrorist attack in britain will not take place , but its attack is still possible .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
the eight terrorist attack suspects arrested were all working in the medical system , and the government will take appropriate measures to deal with the background of foreign immigrants who are working in the medical system .
it is reported that nearly one - third of the workers working in the uk public medical system are qualified to be admitted overseas to medical service .

however , many people are in the mainland and are in such a worry , and many of them are being sp@@ ared and ch@@ ased by the mer@@ ch@@ ants and bro@@ thers who engage in intermedi@@ ary business .
both cars and tr@@ ains , and shanghai automobile , always have to en@@ counter small v@@ end@@ ors and some d@@ ying bloc@@ ks without certificates .
it is not selling bre@@ a@@ thing bur@@ ns , that is selling magaz@@ ines , and many unlicensed intermedi@@ ary pres@@ ent@@ ations , or even intermediate certificates , etc.
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .

without the door , some people came to hong kong , the tourism and small things .
after entering the door , this situation will become more serious . no matter how good y@@ ax@@ ing is , it is also sti@@ r@@ ring and un@@ popular .
a media report said that many foreign tourists who went to xi@@ '@@ an were greatly grat@@ eful to xian , but they were allowed to have more small sh@@ od@@ dy shops selling them all over the place .
including the wind of the grap@@ ple , this type of je@@ wel@@ ry , which is the place of the operations and the places where it is , should be orderly , qu@@ iet and harmonious , and give a resp@@ ec@@ tful environment .
the freedom of v@@ ices of v@@ ices and confu@@ sion of v@@ ices have obj@@ ectively under@@ min@@ ed these public order and formed a pollution and environmental pollution problem , and at the same time , they have provided conditions and opportunities for their operations .
what is important is that these varie@@ ties are the wind@@ ows of the building of spiritual civilization in hong kong , and not only are they imp@@ aired , they are also affecting the development of the local economy .
just think , if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry , you use this chao@@ tic tourism environment to gre@@ et the guests from south to north , who will be willing to come , who will dare to come ?
how can your tourism economy yield results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , the tourist attr@@ action to the north of the tian@@ nan prefecture should be considered a top priority .
none of them are from the market , and the operation of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers of small business should be standardized , and un@@ certified operations should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .

the award of self - motiv@@ ated retirement benefits
the feng@@ yun street in beijing 's dong@@ cheng district has used electricity and other materials as a source of incen@@ tives for 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily surr@@ ender themselves to their insurance .
( xin@@ jing bao , july 10 )
i am del@@ igh@@ ted to see the improvement of the living conditions of these families , but there is still the pr@@ at@@ eness of our award of our army .
feng ju 's deputy director of the neighbor@@ hood office said that , in view of such problems as sc@@ um and minimum guarantee , encouraging the withdrawal of units on their own initiative is an example set for other households .
this model , if it is to encourage other in@@ sured personnel to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it is to use this method to dece@@ ive those who have sought to make minimum insurance , it is not possible to be n@@ ai@@ ve .
in differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up low - income households , the more depend@@ able is the law .
the relevant departments should strengthen the system of minimum protection households in their right to enjoy minimum living allow@@ ance . for instance , timely noti@@ fication of changes in family members , reporting on employment situation , and receiving regular re@@ examination , the relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the withdrawal of the bre@@ eds according to law is a long - term solution .
the street is a good example of who has given awards to families who have retired from the insurance industry ?
as a first - level government organization , the expenses are borne by financial appropri@@ ations .
the money of a family should not be used ?
on the one hand , the number of families with@@ drawing from the minimum allow@@ able income has proven that they have enough self - supporting ability , and on the other hand , does the applic@@ ant for minimum living allow@@ ance still exist ?
the government finance fund , called the life - saving money , should be used to provide char@@ coal in the snow instead of adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .

during the dialogue with liu gang , liu gang said that he was a student of the college of socialism .
( yesterday 's " new beijing news " )
liu di@@ yi 's family services might be better than some cadres appointed by the party , some cadres who are the services of the party , and some people who are the true ones .
the direct election of candidates is the greatest aspect of the appointment system , which is determined by ordinary party members , which is mainly the source of power , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher level organization , and the direction of the source of power , which determin@@ es that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the person responsible are the fundamental factors for determining how the elected person will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such a democratic appearance is like a far@@ ce of democracy .
my view is that such a kind of democracy is more than a m@@ ere form@@ ality .
taking into account the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grassroots level in china , i believe direct election is a major breakthrough , and democracy is a major component part of this territory . we must not under@@ estimate the promotion of democracy at the grassroots level .

her att@@ or@@ ney , her experience in joining the parliament , and her experience in serving as governor of the state of ra@@ j@@ as@@ than , she was given a boost by the government .
she also worked for social welfare , and was a good example of many cultural schools and social welfare organizations .

in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long controlled the ruling congress party .
p@@ ap@@ a@@ eva was supported by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believe p@@ ap@@ hor@@ e will play a role in india 's image of a woman who is dis@@ crimin@@ ating against women , thus enhancing the status of a woman .

the adverse re@@ actions of di@@ a@@ bet@@ es , wen@@ di , have increased significantly .
according to us media reports on the 15th , the heart attack and other adverse reports caused by the anti@@ di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug w@@ end@@ er@@ ad@@ i have recently shown a big up@@ ward trend in the united states .
the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , advis@@ ing di@@ a@@ bet@@ es to be careful with the use of wor@@ m because scientists published a research report in the new jer@@ se@@ y journal on 21 may , saying that this exp@@ ensive drug would greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence rate and lead to higher inci@@ d@@ ence rate of patients .
therefore , m@@ s. 's all@@ erg@@ y is closely watched by doctors and patients .
statistics show that about one month after the issue of safety warnings , the us drug administration received 3@@ 57 regular articles , which triggered an adverse reaction , of which 38 were death reports .
in january and february this year , the drug administration received only 50 and 73 adverse reports respectively .
these bad respon@@ ses are ligh@@ ter when water b@@ list@@ ers are heavily involved in sudden death of heart disease .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that the results of the conclusion that wen di@@ ya 's in@@ security is still too long .
the drug administration will hold a seminar on 30 july on wen@@ di 's y@@ a@@ a .

a few years ago , with the appearance of personnel , the house of some of the houses of this brigade was over@@ taken by regulations , making it difficult for on - the - job cadres to have housing problems and the officers and men to have a relatively large opinion about this .

the 7 - point military uni@@ form desig@@ ner is a guest of china 's military network
beijing , 13 jul -- yang bao@@ jin , a reporter from jin@@ yang city , reported : all units of the armed forces will be replaced by 07 military uni@@ form from 1 august .
this evening , china military net specially invited military materials needed by the air force unit , chen jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and senior engine@@ er of the army equipment research institute , su yang , a fighter of the army uni@@ form department , and su hu@@ ili@@ ang , a ne@@ tiz@@ en inside and outside the army , to ev@@ o@@ ke re@@ perc@@ ussions among the internet users .
the two guests are : the development of military uni@@ forms , which is directly developed .
on the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 07 military uni@@ form is a special unit for the replacement of the old arm@@ or on the basis of 97 - type units . in the series of military uni@@ forms , the improvement has reached as many as several hundred .
the biggest characteristic of the 07 military uni@@ form is its emb@@ odi@@ ment of its characteristics as a result of its establishment of personnel , bringing our military uni@@ form to the series of ser@@ ial pol@@ es , sig@@ ni@@ fying the level of military uni@@ form building , a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the new army uni@@ form type , the problem of the yan bao , the new army uni@@ form , and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the current char@@ ion was jointly developed by the chinese military net and the feng@@ yun net of china .
the feng@@ tai plat@@ o@@ on has raised the quality of the armed forces .
the pla navy 's general armament department announced on 18 june that a batch of advanced coll@@ ectives and individuals from jing jiang , jiangsu province , were transferred to xi@@ ai town armed forces department by lu yu@@ qing , minister of the armed forces of xi@@ ai town , for " winning inform@@ ati@@ zed warfare " under the condition of informatization . the cad@@ ets received unanim@@ ous training .
this is a mechan@@ ized unit that has applied pressure on cadres at the posts in light of the reality of their work posts , and has exer@@ ted efforts to improve the overall quality of the military cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department found out during its investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some cadres working for posts , including corps commander and concurrently serving in military posts , did not concentrate their main energy on armed work .
for this reason , they have adopted the method of training students through centralized training and relying on local party schools to train specialized military cadres on a regular basis , and have devoted great efforts to resolving problems such as narr@@ ow@@ ness of knowledge among cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly give cadres a task to them , and improve their abilities to work at their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for hir@@ ing cadres with specialized arms " , explicitly providing that armed forces ministers must be placed in party committees of zhao@@ ju and no longer in other posts .
we have established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging cadres , which makes those young people who do not meet the needs of the armed forces at the grassroots level , promptly read@@ justed and exchanged them , and promoted and used them in a satisfactory manner .
not long ago , chen yi - song , director of the new century war@@ ri@@ or company , led the militi@@ a technology detachment in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water vessels , thus filling a domestic shortage of vessels and upgrading them into the department of the armed forces of the company .
good will must first be good at end
judging by the results of the competition alone , the score of 2 to 2 is reasonable , and is also acceptable to it , the key lies in the process of the competition , and how many regre@@ ts it .
if the iranian team is 2 - 0 ahead , then the score will be equal , which gives china a different feeling , will be very long .
good will never come to an end . one can say that it is a bad thing .
the lik@@ es are often under circumstances .
this is indeed a fe@@ ather that is good at all .
however , from today 's competition , it seems that it is not so bad .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ xiang , director of xi@@ ong@@ yuan and others , has played a role in europe , but li wei and others are also the veteran players of the long - time class@@ ical field . they can see that they know many things and do not have any problem in their psychological quality according to reason .
this regret was forced to qu@@ it by the iranian team , and probably was caused by the dispatch of troops to the scene .
the iranian team is in a backward condition and has changed to two , and the situation has immediately become a reality .
i was also replaced by three good soldiers in the second half , but the effect was not good .
overcome the problem of being good at the start and not being good at the end , and find the root of the problem .
so long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods of correc@@ ting the problems are not difficult to find .
they are afraid of going to the hospital in a hur@@ ry .
if this goes on , then , it will be a problem of getting more competitive , and will still be committed . if we cannot talk about a further match that everyone is looking forward to .
