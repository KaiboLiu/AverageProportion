experts believe that this is a challenge to china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ates the china military threat theory , and is a interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new defense direc@@ tive document of the pentagon .
this report , which is 92 p@@ ages long , is used in three sections to explain china 's military power and the us countermeasures it should adopt , and the report directly men@@ tions a total of 92 sor@@ cer@@ y or di@@ agr@@ am of china , and says that as a major and newly emerging big country , china has the greatest sincerity to engage in military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have any countermeasures , china may very well develop traditional military weapons , thus breaking the traditional
china 's military academy research institute of the world military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has put forward a proposal on a national defense strategy report that china may pose a military challenge to the united states .
the reason why the report clearly stated for the first time that russia 's ep@@ is@@ od@@ es from india were the newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china military threat theory , gave more attention to the matter .
china 's military science academy resear@@ cher , major general peng guang@@ qian , said .
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report , " the same day the us president bush also briefed congress on the budget for fiscal year 2007 , including the defense budget for fiscal year 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
the reason why the kmt has been adding to the military actions taken in iraq and afghanistan is that the us military spending for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states has fabr@@ icated the threat of other countries to follow the same tactics of the threat of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of the pentagon 's mechan@@ ic of manufacturing enemy forces . the real purpose of the report is to strive for more national defense funds and to fish more profits for the huge us arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
zeng qinghong , who has participated in the military expert written in the chinese national defense white paper many times , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has generally shown a decline .
the official statistics show that in 2004 , the volume of china 's defense spending was about 40 percent of the state 's financial expenditures during the same period .
the 2005 chinese economic and trade budget is 2@@ 4.@@ 4@@ 66 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the us national defense spending , and the per capita military spending of the us is only about 1 / 60 . the per capita military spending of the us military is about 1 / 30 .
the united states ' territorial area and china 's territorial area are generally quite large , and the gap between military spending is so huge , and who has gone beyond the normal defense needs is un@@ justi@@ fi@@ able .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their oppon@@ ent milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china - based defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been a single country in the past and at present , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not made any decision on establishing military bases in any other country , nor has it sent any troops to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas . it has only deployed a dozen of military bases in asia .
professor li xin@@ sheng of the institute of international relations of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas ass@@ em@@ bled cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 24 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the legislative council election , how to draw a new government blueprint into the current international focus of attention .
hamas will implement what kind of new policy will directly affect the peace process and the relevant parties will follow in their policies .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has also added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future developments .
( sub@@ title ) premier posts fl@@ ower
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some people outside are worried that hamas 's prime minister will be inter@@ tw@@ ined with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , as the egyptian president is visiting egypt , hamas leader mu@@ shar@@ af stressed that the palestinian new government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the power to hold the real power , and this has threatened to suspend its economic aid to palestine and to pass on tax taxes to palestine .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas 's flexible policy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition as much as possible , the recent meeting of hamas leaders at home and abroad in egypt decided to select the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of g@@ ab@@ ri@@ el al-@@ j@@ ah@@ r@@ am as the new prime minister .
this is a step that has not been received by the relevant parties .
the palestinian analysts said that the palestinian people will not be able to spend their lives in their prime minister 's office , and the most crucial thing is that the prime minister 's candidate should be less@@ ened as much as possible , and only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of the organization .
( sub@@ title ) power is the most important issue in distribution
from the internal point of view , the challenges facing hamas in forming a cabinet are that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the palestine daily news said in its article that the hamas ' social welfare program is a form of " peace and stability " in the region , but it lacks experience in governing and is not in keeping with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the governing experience .
hamas has been in power for a long time since the election to establish a political partnership with fat@@ ah .
the fat@@ ah internal group is now holding a vote on whether to enter the cabinet , and a single faction fav@@ ors participation in the new government , thus doing something that can be done , and the other faction rej@@ ects hamas 's invitation . the feeling is willing to do a very positive demonstration of the opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the source said that the united states has been trying to use the palestinian - israeli conflict to split the country under the advice of ab@@ b@@ as .
even if this is the case , the palestinian - israeli conflict will be settled with fat@@ ah .
in addition , another way is to establish a framework of the legislative council , which is separated from the par@@ tis@@ an cabinet .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific list is un@@ known .
in view of the strong attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts - type government has no choice but to form a cabinet that reduc@@ es external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will be nom@@ inated as prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative council takes office on 16 february .
( sub@@ title ) armed forces should follow .
hamas has a large number of weapons in its hands , and it is also facing another thor@@ ny problem in its organization of the new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in politics with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ash@@ m@@ ir emphasized on 9 august that armed resistance is the choice of the organization 's strategy .
the armed problem actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has adopted a democratic and free approach to the election of the first party of the legislative council to receive international recognition , thus making its subordinate armed factions become a " tr@@ um@@ pe@@ t " brigade of the ji@@ us@@ an brigade equally leg@@ alized means to bring it into the government 's security organ .
hamas has proposed to include all factions in the palestinian national authority .
the current palestinian - israeli peace - keeping force has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel .
moreover , the fat@@ ah - led organization relationship has sl@@ ack@@ ened its subordinate armed factions , such as ab@@ id@@ ah marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , fat@@ ah marty@@ rs ' guards , and the fl@@ ying eag@@ les of the mag@@ as@@ a camp .
the responsible person of hamas who is responsible for forming the cabinet must reach a consensus with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are of their own own political power , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the authority for security management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence forces , police and civil defense organs , and other organs , but the interior ministry of the new government shall be under the control of the ministry of interior .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no final document has been made .

since the beginning of 2006 , there have been four chinese citizens working in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a wide range of concern .
china 's foreign ministry has already expressed its representations to south africa on this issue and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and guard against it . overseas chinese are strengthening solidarity and friendship and cooper@@ ating with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
the reason why we have sent us the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of victims is how to shed our hearts .
the government will continue to support the work of the government and the government , and will continue to support the work of the government of south africa , he said .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case on 5 february of the chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing in south africa . a suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are tracking down another suspect .
the report also said that the chinese government has decided to ban the sale of the hong kong business@@ man in january this year , and the money and property of the south african business@@ man was recovered .

according to a report by the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
at present , the number of chinese living in south africa is about 200,000 , and the number of urban villages in south africa is only about 200,000 .
the analysts here believe that the gap between south africa 's social wealth and wealth , the high unemployment rate , the rampant guns , and the lack of a deterr@@ ent , thus the rate of crime is still high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have a common sense of cash and are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal elements ' financial attacks .

if the high - tech mine is not implemented , it will be dis@@ posed of and dis@@ car@@ ded . it will be ordered to immediately stop production according to law .
the water level continues to be improved
we should regard the work of reporting the 5@@ 2@@ 43 public notice to society , and the recent reports of more than 700 coal mine p@@ its from various localities that have been reported to have been closed down to the truth .
we should regard closing down as a regular work , and constantly close down those enterprises that undermine resources and poll@@ ut@@ ants ' environment and do not possess safety conditions .
the water level of the mountain
we must immediately correct the phenomenon of spreading rumors to stop a few large state - owned mining enterprises from sli@@ ding down@@ stream management and to guide the management of small mines that are chao@@ tic .
in particular , we should pay attention to key state - owned coal mines , and absolutely not allow super@@ ficial sc@@ al@@ es to produce super - capacity coal production .
this year 's production safety control indices require that all kinds of accidents in the country drop by 3@@ -@@ 3 percent compared with last year , including a decrease of 3.@@ 5@@ percent in coal mines .
a joint military exercise involving more than 10 people was held in the southern province of beijing , where the number of accidents was more than 50 percent .
these control indices have already been issued to the provincial - level people 's governments , and various localities are implementing the policies at the grassroots and enterprise levels at various levels .

xinhua news agency , du@@ ling , february 17 th , the press analysis said that the decision to send the li@@ ang@@ a incident may be un@@ certain .
xinhua news agency , gao peng ,
although italy 's repeated orders have said that the du@@ tch winter olympics will be ch@@ ased for use during the winter olympics , the athletes may face a hel@@ l battle , but the current situation is very good .
the du@@ an winter olympic games explo@@ ded on the 16@@ th .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent the li@@ ps out of the winter olympics . she had won the winter med@@ al at the current winter olympics for 15 kilometers of the women 's br@@ on@@ ze med@@ al .
the international winter season for the two - day world winter league made a decision on sending the two - year ban on the same day .
the chinese government has always stipulated that athletes must be the first to be used for the olympic games , and the results will be dis@@ man@@ tled and the quali@@ fication for the games will be depriv@@ ed of the right to participate , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , the united states has to carry and use the d@@ oping agents in accordance with italian law , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who try to commit the crimes are still facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government signed a memorandum of understanding on the protection of intellectual property rights after a year of hard work . the two sides agreed to follow the italian law during the winter olympics to deal with the olympic games using stimul@@ ants .
after the i@@ oc 's unremitting efforts , italy has made a great deal of preparations for the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that the police will not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place during the winter olympics . however , drug - taking athletes will still accept investigation by italian prosecu@@ tors .
some reports said that italy has over@@ looked the winter olympics in tur@@ in .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter p@@ is@@ an@@ ter have not confirmed the case .
russia 's winter season for the two teams is co@@ den@@ amed " the world cup " and the " k@@ it@@ ty haw@@ k " has left the city at noon on the 17@@ th .
zeng qinghong , who once worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , believes that once the or@@ ph@@ ans were sent to china , the matter could eventually be completely un@@ covered .
shi kang cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have made positive efforts in the winter olympics to combat stimul@@ ants . they have never completely resolved the problem . even if italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is that .
according to the previous italian policy on the use of stimul@@ ants to athletes , the number of people who banned the ban has been the most severe punishment is only two years of prison terms and implementation of bu@@ m@@ ps .
therefore , italy 's ant@@ a social security bureau senior reporter , pi@@ er@@ re , said that the possibility of sending the li@@ a into prison was very poor , and the top was a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although italy 's court could make a de@@ but trial , the italian police could not possibly send a len@@ i@@ ent to a foreign country to serve their sentence .
if the len@@ i@@ ent ref@@ us@@ al to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not have any alternative .
