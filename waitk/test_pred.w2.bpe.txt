experts believe that insurance is a very short time .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 c
according to a report by china securities news , the " regulations on the management of insurance funds overseas investment " were promulgated a few days ago . insurance funds have a broader space for the use of the capital market .
china 's hu@@ o company 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the good domestic capital market will not be possible in the near future for the insurance companies to invest in insurance , and this also means that they will not diver@@ t the funds from the domestic stock market in the near future .
the report says many insurance agencies hold the same view .
experts said that because the current rmb is not yet available , the insurance agencies are not able to ev@@ ade risks , and therefore the time for large - scale purchase of foreign currencies is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said that the chinese government has always attached great importance to the distribution of assets , and overseas investment should account for a considerable portion of the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the relatively large appreciation pressure of the renminbi , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to carry out overseas investment .
the government has also decided to increase the foreign exchange reserves by a small margin .

china 's top legisl@@ ator calls for more effective measures to protect intellectual property rights ( ipr )
chen shui - bian secre@@ tly criticized the judicial authorities for involvement in the election of the taiwan " judicial yuan " and denied and wanted to explain it .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 28 c chen shui - bian 's letter of int@@ ent on 30 july questi@@ oned the judicial personnel on the island 's attempt to get involved in the election of the leader of the taiwan region .
taiwan 's judicial administrative college is highly qualified ,
according to taiwan 's " hu@@ o@@ yan report , " chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the prosecu@@ tor or investig@@ ator on 30 june , and interven@@ ed in the affair due to political or election considerations , and even tried to influence the election activities of all political candidates . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it was very difficult .
in view of chen shui - bian 's qu@@ ery , the court president of taiwan 's judicial organs has not responded to the call of secretary - general fan guang@@ q@@ un , and gao jin@@ chi has spoke on behalf of the judicial yuan .
gao jin@@ chi said : taiwan 's basic law and discipline of judges are all clearly declared that judges should go beyond the party 's par@@ tis@@ an or political party activities , nor should they be elected , and that judges are very cautious about the relevant restrictions , and that judges are very cautious about observing the law , and that judges believe in the law courts are very good .
gao jin@@ chi pointed out : the ga@@ o@@ yao higher the higher rank of judge zhang sheng@@ xi attended the grand ceremony of k@@ ad@@ ena school several years ago , because the relevant courses have the color of a political party and a self - discipline committee formed by judges .
zhang sheng@@ xi once wished to join the dpp , and because he took the position to run in the election , he decided to give up .
gao jin@@ chi held that if a case is tried in a case , a case may be heard at a trial level , and the result of the judgment cannot be won by the judgment alone , then the judge should not have any political intention .
germany to lower professional personnel 's thre@@ sh@@ old
the report on the work of the pla general staff headquarters in ber@@ lin on 1 july was published by the people 's liberation army [ pla ] .
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ av@@ an said a few days ago that germany should lower the " bill " to impose restrictions on the import of foreign specialized personnel , and increase the import of foreign talents , to resolve the problem of professional talent being pu@@ sh@@ ed up in germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany has become the largest developing country with a population of 15 to 64 years old .
if there is no sufficient immigrants , it will be impossible to reach 20@@ 20 , germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6@@ percent .
however , the german employers ' union and the german engine@@ er association reported that the german labor market is now in a very good shape , with engine@@ ers and professional technical talent having a big hand .
according to the german federal labor agency , the unemployment rate in germany was down to 5.@@ 9 percent in may this year , up from 2.@@ 7 percent in may , while the technical division was suppl@@ em@@ ented by 9@@ 6 percent .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set up a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of foreign talent .
the german newspaper " hu@@ o@@ xi " stipulates that the professional personnel of non - eu countries cannot be reduced to a minimum of 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , or they cannot be employed in germany or in the capacity of a residence .
sh@@ am@@ man suggested that this limit be reduced to the euro .
do n't super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously engage in theoretical studies
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates in article 8 : those who have engaged in professional work such as legal study and teaching , and have high - ranking personnel , such as those who have higher attend@@ ance or similar professional standards , who have applied for lawyers ' work , may be allowed to practice a law@@ yer 's practice in a barr@@ ist@@ er 's profession in the state council .
( 28 june ) " zhong@@ guo fang "
the law has the power to make theoretical innovations and to seek truth from facts , and the former mainly includes teaching and research work , etc.
for a long time , the theory of marxism has been constantly emerging in the ideological and political circles and the cultural and ideological trends have been frequently observed in the theoretical circles .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the difference in the division of labor and law , and has no choice but to support any party .
however , the " law on lawyers " has a big power in the process of being subj@@ ected to the approval of legal theory in an objective manner .
in fact , some people engaged in the study of laws and international laws and other purely theoretical studies and teaching , and their theory is even more profound and in@@ consistent with the actual practice of the law .
in this way , the b@@ ar system is no doubt a legal person .
i think that the theory of the theory is not only the same , but also the experts and scholars will often influence or even rej@@ ect the court ruling . this is also the direct manif@@ estation of super@@ sti@@ tion .

hello , let 's make a business .
the tourism plan .
it can be seen in china , and many people have suffered such a kind of ag@@ it@@ ated , and they have been engaged in business and sales and business as intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is a car or a train , a car , or a car , i always have to face the death of a small business or a number of un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ ary .
it is not a child who be@@ ts a bab@@ y or bur@@ ns a ca@@ ke , and it is a magazine that sel@@ ls many intermedi@@ ary organs without a license , or even a false or false appe@@ ti@@ te .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are too poor to make it into a ben@@ evol@@ ence .
in some of the stor@@ ies , many of them also feel the same .
if the door is not opened , there are people who are young and young .
after entering the door , this situation will be more .
the media reported that , when he visited many foreign tourists in xian , he made an appeal to the xi ' an mon@@ ument , but he was not satisfied with the fact that many small business leaders who had received a lot of p@@ iles were allowed to sell their products across the country .
they include the noise of the bus st@@ ops , the spec@@ tac@@ ular and the wal@@ king place , the civilized appearance of the cam@@ pu@@ s , the qu@@ iet and harmonious society , and the environment of life .
the sales of the products are free , and they are conf@@ used .
the important thing is that these are the results of the construction of the spiritual civilization in hong kong , and they are not only the problem of the image , but also the impact on the local economic development .
just think , you want to make a big effort to strengthen the tourism industry , but you use this kind of un@@ usual tourism environment to welcome the guests coming to the south and north . who is willing to come , who will dare come ?
your tourism economy is also very good ?
with the arrival of the peak season of tourism , the weather will create a civilized environment for tourists from the north of ti@@ an@@ shan .
i do n't know whether the market is the business of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers , and the business without license should be standardized . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized and orderly environment is the only way to make one happy and to fulfill the task of rejuven@@ ating the country .
in a word , do n't let deal@@ ers and deal@@ ers come .
i think i will be able to make a profit of the whole family .
the beijing dong@@ cheng district office issued a tel@@ e@@ grap@@ h and other items as its main channel for the dis@@ miss@@ al of 12 households .
( the " jing@@ jing bao " july 10 )
i am very proud of these family life .
hello jian@@ xi@@ u street office deputy director : she is suspected of dece@@ iv@@ ing and sl@@ and@@ ering people and other problems , encouraging them to volun@@ t@@ arily withdraw their pen@@ sion , and this is an example for other low - income households .
this example is that if we encourage other low - income workers to work hard to get rid of their difficulties , we should indeed encourage them , and if they want to use this to influence and che@@ at those who have long been in low protection , they will not be inf@@ ant .
in differ@@ enti@@ ating and dec@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ oning households , more depend@@ ence is on the law .
the relevant departments should strengthen the protection of low - income households to perform their obligations when enjoying the minimum - guarantee insurance : if they promptly noti@@ fy family members and income changes , report on employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination , the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the law of detention and protection is a long - term plan .
the street has been closed for the elderly with an award of honor and a bur@@ ner .
as the primary government organization , the neighbor@@ hood expenditure is allocated by the treasury .
and the number of tax@@ pay@@ ers who have already been engaged in the business should not be pe@@ t@@ ty .
on the one hand , the family that with@@ dra@@ ws from the minimum has proved that it has already had a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency and ability , and on the other hand , the number of people applying for low protection still exists .
the " s@@ avi@@ or " government appropri@@ ated for saving money should be delivered to the s@@ now@@ y s@@ now@@ y areas , not the super@@ markets .
liu said that china is willing to be a service provid@@ er , and that he is even more arrog@@ ant .
on 10 july , the first public promotion official of the whole country was named " the sun 's voice " in the newly elected village , mu q@@ iz@@ hi town , the first public serv@@ ant in the new district , received the democratic call for 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
at the news conference held by reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu con@@ g - yi defined himself as a child 's service .
( yesterday 's " jing@@ ji bao " )
liu said : " i am not happy to see the situation in the country . "
the public - run nomination system is the largest one in the world , and the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses of people , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher authorities , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be in the first place to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for anyone are the key to determining how the elected is working .
some people have doubts about this kind of democracy and are even more like a democratic show .
my view is that there is such a democratic style .
considering the fact that china 's grassroots democratic politics building is a matter of the present , i believe that the promotion of the people 's democratic system is a major breakthrough and democratic centr@@ alism is an important component of the system , and it is not sup@@ posed to under@@ estimate the progress of grassroots democratic politics .

she also devoted herself to social welfare . she is a great many cultural educ@@ ators and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why par@@ ker became a candidate was because she was unswervingly playing the game of indian national congress party chairman so@@ on@@ an .
in india , the gan pref@@ ectural family has been controlling the ruling national congress party for a long time .
i was influ@@ enced by a large number of female voters , and female voters believe that the par@@ ade will be a symb@@ ol of india 's women 's image , which is seriously dis@@ crimin@@ ating against women , and the women 's status will be enhanced .
the constitution stipulates that india is the state in the name of the federal state and the president , and that it does not represent any party organization , and more is a kind of symb@@ ol .

to this end , they adopted the method of concentr@@ ating training on students and relying on local party schools to train and train special - purpose military cadres at regular inter@@ vals , and worked hard to resolve the problem of excessive business of cadres with knowledge and arms .

the good will have to be good .
the competition results alone are that the two - thir@@ ds score is reasonable .
if iran is the second - highest - ranking iranian team , and then the score is di@@ ame@@ tr@@ ically divided , then china 's feeling is definitely different , and it will be very long and dec@@ ent .
the first thing is that we must not be good at the end of the game .
i often have a lot of things in the situation .
this is indeed a matter of no mis@@ ery and mis@@ ery .
however , from the perspective of today 's competition , it seems that it is not all right .
sun ji@@ hai : sun xiao@@ yu 's family was a big family of the people in europe .
this is a hu@@ e of the iranian team , which is probably due to the tight deployment of troops .
the iranian team won the champion@@ ship in the second place in a backward situation , and the scene was immediately shak@@ en .
i got half a match .
we should overcome the unhealthy tend@@ encies that cannot be good at the end , and find the root of the problem .
if problems are accurately identified , the problem will be changed .
they are afraid of being imp@@ ati@@ ent to get medical treatment .
if this goes on , then the k@@ ic@@ king will be more and more , and the old will be a mistake , and no mention of k@@ ic@@ king a further step forward that everyone is exp@@ ecting .
