germany to lower professional personnel import thre@@ sh@@ old
the first artillery corps of the chinese people 's liberation army ( pla ) has launched a large - scale military exercise in ber@@ lin .
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ al@@ v@@ are@@ z said that germany should reduce " the fees " in " the law " to import foreign specialized talents , and increase the import of foreign talents to solve the problems left behind by germany 's professional talent .

if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , it will be 20@@ -@@ 20 , and germany 's labor force will be 6 percent less than the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ er association reported that the german labor market is still open to the world , with professional talent making it eas@@ ier for engine@@ ers to make their choice .
according to the statistics released by the federal labor office , the german labor market in may this year witnessed a rise of about 17@@ 0,000 workers , and technicians were eager to supply 9@@ 600 people .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for bringing in foreign talents .

do not go to the theoretical circle
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : those who have engaged in legal research and other professional work , and who have high - ranking or similar professional standards , who apply for lawyers ' professional practice , may be granted the legal profession to lawyers for their professional services after being examined and approved by the judicial administration department of the state council .
( adopted on 28 june ) " china "
the law has theoretical knowledge , and the truth about things ,
for a long time , the theory and the practice of the legal profession have grown pol@@ itely , and people like theory , and they think it is wise to think that theory l@@ acking necessary care and care about mechanical things are simply things that go about mechan@@ ics , and others go about theoretical studies in the field of theory , and criticize the practice of the theory of len@@ i@@ ency .
in this way , the legal profession can do a lot of work to maintain , not just talk about , using a variety of ways to support others .
however , the " law on lawyers " makes a mistake , and makes things worse , such as legal theory , theoretical innovation , and legal norms higher in the realm of law .
in fact , some people engaged in the study of international law and other purely theoretical studies and teaching , such as the theory study and teaching , have followed the theory again with the theory of law , and are si - si .
in this way , lawyers ' sex@@ ual abuse is a matter of concern to legal affairs .
the influence of theory on super@@ sti@@ tion is not limited to these , such as experts and discussions on things , it often aff@@ ects or even rej@@ ects court verdic@@ ts , and it is also the direct expression of such super@@ sti@@ tion .

hello , let 's make a v@@ ow .
the tourism industry , the char@@ m , the relax@@ ing of the rules , and the enjo@@ yment of nature and civilization to the maximum degree .
however , the number of tourists from abroad has encountered such a kind of an@@ no@@ y , and it is always har@@ bor@@ ed by traders and intermedi@@ aries .
whether it is the car or the train , the upper car , always have to face the pe@@ d@@ d@@ le and some un@@ veri@@ fied intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling fl@@ ow@@ ery c@@ akes , that is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many other intermedi@@ aries without t@@ estim@@ ony , introducing food , and even making arbitr@@ ary appe@@ ti@@ te , etc.
if you do not accept it , he can catch you several hundred meters , it 's very difficult to be ben@@ evol@@ ent if you do n't succeed .
in some scen@@ ery , many things are equally inter@@ esting .
those who have not entered the gate of the tour and little tricks are often attracted .
after entering the door , this situation will be more serious , and good y@@ ax@@ ing will be also up@@ set .
some media have reported that the number of foreign tourists who went to xian was a little too much .
these include the bus 's bus stop , the noise , the noise , and the wal@@ king area , and the resp@@ ec@@ tful place , should be civilized , qu@@ iet and harmonious , giving a pleas@@ ant environment .
the price of freedom of deal@@ ers has been rising .
the important thing is that these things are the most important window , and a sharp arr@@ ow in the development of the spiritual civilization in hong kong , and the damage to the image will not only be an issue of image , but will also have an impact on the local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a big and strong tourist industry , you use this kind of dis@@ astr@@ ous tourist environment to welcome the visitors coming from the south and the north . who would dare ?
your tourist economy is also a matter of how much benefit can you achieve ?
with the peak tourism season , the weather will bring a great variety of visitors to the north of the tian@@ nan mountain , and it should be said that the pressing task is to do so .
there is no market , small mer@@ ch@@ ants ' haw@@ kers ' business behavior should be regul@@ ated , and un@@ lic@@ enced operations should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can only be made del@@ igh@@ ted .
in a word , i would like to let traders go .

in the process of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up low - income households , more depend@@ ence is on the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the work of providing minimum guarantee for the income of the households concerned : they should promptly report the changes in family personnel and income , report their employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination . the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is necessary to make deduc@@ tions according to law .
the street is also open to the gir@@ ls who give awards to them ?
as the primary level government organization , street expenses are determined by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
and tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the income of those who have with@@ drawn from the minimum guarantee family has become self - evident , while on the other hand , those who apply for minimum guarantee still do not exist ?
the " red army " , which is called a life - saving money , should send off an ab@@ ys@@ s of mis@@ ery and not spend extra money in the golden sky .

my view is that there is such a hu@@ e .
in consideration of the reality that china 's grassroots democratic political construction and the current situation , i think that the promotion of the public by universal suf@@ fr@@ age is a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this , and we must not under@@ estimate the efforts to promote the building of grass - roots democratic politics .

modern military uni@@ forms are three functions
first , the identification function .
different countries ' armed forces are different in different ways , and important signs of the armed forces and the people .
in the world , the number of countries with a history of over 100 is still relatively low , although the use of military uni@@ forms is basically the same , the uni@@ forms of the armed forces of no two countries are completely the same .
second , the symbol@@ ic function .

if iran is the second - largest play@@ er , then it will play a wed@@ ding , then it will feel a little bit more impres@@ sive to china , and will be very popular with the people 's morale , and will go back@@ wards .

the remarks made by these people were forced to qu@@ it by the iranian team , because they were ready to go around .
the iranian team is in a backward condition and has been replaced by two , and the scene has been followed by each other at once .
the feeling of dis@@ order in the half was also changed three times , but the effect was not good .
overcome the mentality of being good at the beginning and not being good at the end , and must accurately find the root of problems .
as long as the problem is accurately identified and the methods for re@@ moving the existing problems are not difficult to find .

if this goes on , it will be more difficult to k@@ ick more competitions , old problems will be made , and no one hopes for k@@ ic@@ king a game that is going to be held .
