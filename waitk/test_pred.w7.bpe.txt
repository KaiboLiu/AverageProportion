experts believe that the im@@ proper pattern of the domestic stock market will not be diverted to the domestic stock market funds in the short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional measures for managing investment in foreign insurance funds " recently was promulgated , and insurance funds have a broader space for utilizing the capital market .
china 's chief investment officer liu le@@ fei said that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not be large - scale foreign investment by foreign exchange through the purchase of foreign exchange . this also means that the funds will not be diverted to domestic stock markets in the short term .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say that since the renminbi products market is not yet available , insurance institutions are not taking adequate precau@@ tions , and the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : for a long time , in terms of asset allocation , foreign investment should account for a certain percentage of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given that the rmb is under greater pressure to appreciate , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
foreign investment in foreign exchange procurement should be treated with cau@@ tion under the current situation .

china news , july 30 , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the island 's judicial personnel 's attempt to get involved in the taiwan region 's election of leaders .
the executive director of taiwan 's zhi@@ jin judicial court said on the same day that the performance of the island 's judges is in@@ consistent with chen shui - bian 's remarks and asked chen shui - bian to explain his explanation .
according to a report by taiwan 's " gu@@ i@@ jin " on 30 may , chen shui - bian called the prosecu@@ tor or investig@@ ator , and because of political factors or election considerations , he got involved in the election campaign and even attempted to influence the election activities of various party candidates , saying that he hoped that such a phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's qu@@ ery , director of the judicial department of taiwan yue yue sheng did not respond in response , while secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un spoke on behalf of the judicial council .
gao jin@@ chi said : the basic law on taiwan and the rules for judges are all clear that judges should not take part in any political party activities beyond the party or the party , and judges are very cautious in observing the relevant rules and regulations and that judges believe that they have done a very good job in restr@@ aining justice than judges .

germany to reduce import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the reporters learned from the national defense university of ber@@ lin , july 1 ,
german education and scientific research minister s@@ ay@@ w@@ ang@@ a said recently that germany should lower the " compu@@ ter@@ ized law " restrictions on the import of foreign professional talent , and resolve the problem of prof@@ ic@@ i@@ ency of german professional talent by increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
the report of the organization of economic cooperation ( o@@ ec@@ d ) says that the number of labor force from germany to the age of 15 to 64 will be reduced year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6 percent compared with the present .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association reported that engine@@ ers have made technical innovations in the german labor market .
according to the statistics of the german federal labor bureau , in may of this year , the supply of 14@@ ,000 german engine@@ ers in the labor market was about 12@@ 0,000 , and the skilled came in with some 9@@ 600 .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " thr@@ u@@ ster law " stipulates that the professional talent from non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain the permission for working and residence in germany .
sha wan suggested that this quota be lowered to the mark .
there is no need to super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous laws .
the " draft law on lawyers " , which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : those who have engaged in professional work such as teaching on legal research and are also professional at a high level , such as high level prof@@ ic@@ i@@ ency or similar professional level , and those who apply for a law@@ yer 's practi@@ se may be permitted to practi@@ se their work in law after being examined and veri@@ fied by the judicial and administrative departments of the state council .
( " zhong@@ guo gu@@ of@@ u " ) on 28 june
there are legal concepts such as the theoretical circle and the practice of the system , which mainly include legal teaching and research work , etc. , which is the most important thing in legal application , and the more is the concrete actions of legal consultation , legal consultation , and other legal services .
for a long time , the legal circle has been cur@@ ious and the practice of acting in practice . the theory of the law circle is not yet known as the need for the technology of the legal profession . it is only the theory of the theory of the theory circle of the circle of the industry , which has been used for a long time , is not used to guide practice .
the legal system can be done in order to maintain the dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy of the division of labor and not to support any party .
however , the law@@ yer system in the " law of lawyers " has obj@@ ectively recognized the legal system , which is higher than the legal system .
in fact , some people who are engaged in scientific research and teaching on legal system and international law have made a deep theoretical study and teaching . their theory is also more profound than that of law .
this is undoubtedly an im@@ practical legal system for the legal profession .
the super@@ sti@@ tion of the theoretical circle is not the only thing to do , but the expert and experts ' proof will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court 's ruling , and it is also the direct expression of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain to lower terror attack
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 , by w@@ ire ( reporter lin guo )
the british government 's top - grade terrorist attack rate has been lowered from the top level to the most severe attack level , which indicated that the terrorist attacks in britain will not happen soon , but there is still a possibility of m@@ iti@@ g@@ ating attacks .
at present , the british police are shif@@ ting the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects of terrorist attacks were all working in the medical system , and the government will conduct a comprehensive investigation on the background of the migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly 3,000 people working in britain 's public health system have been admitted overseas .
prime minister t@@ ony blair also asked to investigate the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and employers or relevant organizations will be required to provide data on the background .
do n't let business people take care of
the plan for tourism is to relax the m@@ old of the m@@ old , to the maximum extent to enjoy the fruits of natural science and social civilization .
but in china , many people have experienced such a kind of anx@@ ie@@ ty , and they are turned into a business - like commercial deal@@ ers and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
whether it is a car or a train , the upper whe@@ el always faces the pressure of death of small deal@@ ers and some un@@ certified intermedi@@ aries .
it is not to sell lo@@ y@@ alty s@@ car@@ c@@ akes , that is , newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then many non - not@@ ched intermedi@@ aries introducing cat@@ ches , even making false appe@@ ti@@ te cards .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and it is very un@@ successful that you can become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some cases , many people feel the same .
if we enter the gate , some people will be cur@@ ious about the tourist and small - size products .
after entering the house , this situation became even more serious , and y@@ a@@ xing , no matter how good , was also bl@@ ur@@ red and ob@@ sc@@ ured .
some media reported that many foreign tourists who came to xian were not exc@@ ited about the sil@@ ic@@ on mon@@ uments in xian , but were allowed to be du@@ b@@ bed everywhere by small business haw@@ kers .
this includes the appearance of the loc@@ ust of the wind , the appearance of the station , the appearance of the tr@@ ick and the place of the air , and the order of civilization and harmony , which have given the environment of a calm heart .
the free trade of deal@@ ers has made a m@@ ess of the mind that obj@@ ectively destroyed these public order and formed a system of se@@ wage pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it also provides them with favorable conditions and opportunities for them to get rid of .
the important thing is that these people are the window for building local spiritual civilization and are ta@@ il@@ or@@ ed to see the entire le@@ op@@ ard , and the damage is not only an image problem , but also will have an impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to be a big and powerful tourist industry , you will use this huge and ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests coming to the south to the north . who is willing to come and who da@@ res to come ?
how can you achieve economic benefits ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from the northern part of the sky . it should be said that the pressing task is to be to create a civilized tourist environment .
not a market , the operation of pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers of small businesses should be standardized , and the operation of unlicensed businesses should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
only a civilized and orderly environment can allow people to be happy and return to their original dest@@ ination and to pros@@ per .
one sentence is to make a com@@ ic show of the business deal@@ ers .
the system of giving free re@@ in on its own initiative and dis@@ miss@@ al of insurance benefits
the beijing dong@@ cheng district construction company has produced some power - efficient products as a low - income family re@@ fund for 12 households that volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ treat .
( " xin jing bao " on 10 july )
this writ@@ er was happy to see the improvement of the family life , but he was still using the pattern of giving him an award to re@@ pay his own initiative , but he was also very complicated .
deputy director of the ji@@ ao@@ zi neighbor@@ hood office said that in view of problems such as sc@@ am and low security , encouraging the active retirement of insurance is an example for other low - income households .
if this model encourages other low - income people to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if it is used to s@@ la@@ p the people who have long been trying to obtain low - income guarantees , it is not strang@@ e .
in the process of differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing up low - income households , it is more dependent on the law .
departments concerned should strengthen the protection of low - income households when enjoying the minimum - income insurance , and should report promptly the changes in family personnel and income , report on the employment situation , accept regular re@@ views , and so on , while relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term plan to eliminate the law .
the neighbor@@ hood has given an incen@@ tive to families who have been laid off .
as a primary government organization , the neighbor@@ hood is responsible for its expenditures .
and the money for tax@@ pay@@ ers should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the family that with@@ drew from the low - income insurance prov@@ es that it has already possess@@ ed a certain degree of self - reliance capacity , and on the other hand , is n't the applicants applying for low - income insurance still having their own ability ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called the money - saving money , should be given the c@@ off@@ in in the snow , and should not be used to add flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu zheng@@ yi is more dis@@ satisfied with this .
on 10 july , the first public opinion poll in the whole country , the ma@@ il@@ an town in the new k@@ ai@@ du district , liu qi@@ yi , was accepted for the fourth time after taking office with a democratic satisfaction rate of 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
when the reporter held talks with liu , liu di@@ an@@ yi defined himself as a service provid@@ er .
( by xin jing bao )
liu qi@@ yi 's m@@ im@@ ic@@ kn@@ ess service is more likely to be compared with the few appointed cadres who have been appointed more tru@@ th@@ fully , and let some people get a bit more prof@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
the system of public - run appointments is most bin@@ ding in comparison with the system of public - promotion , and the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members to decide the source of power , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power has determined that the former must be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility for the person is the fundamental factor determining how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people have questi@@ oned such a democratic im@@ pre@@ gn@@ able m@@ im@@ ic@@ kn@@ ess as a democratic cur@@ tain .
my view is that the m@@ ud@@ d@@ led democratic system is not better than that .
in consideration of the history and current situation of the building of grass - roots democratic politics in china , i believe that the public - holding elections have already been a major breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this . we should not under@@ estimate the importance of promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .
india is expected to elect first female presidential analy@@ st as the election is likely to be more likely , and female voters hope to raise the status of women
on 23 june , p@@ aul ca@@ str@@ o was in charge of the presidential candidate 's document before it was completed .
the cur@@ tain was raised on the 19@@ th presidential election . the new president will be elected in the capacity of vice president sh@@ aw@@ at and l@@ arr@@ y b@@ ish@@ op , the l@@ ar@@ ag@@ a state , which was re@@ signed recently .
p@@ ope is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become the first female president in india 's m@@ op .
p@@ aul ca@@ str@@ o is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ch@@ at@@ ter comes from the opposition party 's opposition people 's party .
because the congress party has a superior position in the presidential election group , the media and the public are thr@@ owing away , and the possibility of p@@ astr@@ um being elected is quite large .
p@@ aul ca@@ str@@ o , 72 , is the governor of l@@ arr@@ y mas@@ an@@ jia state .
she , law@@ yer , has a rich experience in the parliament , and has been in the state of l@@ arr@@ a j@@ as@@ on . she was treated as a government - run business .
she is also dedicated to social welfare , and is a honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural tem@@ pt@@ ation education and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that p@@ hu@@ m@@ ph@@ an has become a candidate because she has always been blin@@ ded by the chairman of the national congress party of india , s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the k@@ and@@ an family has been in power for a long time .
par@@ c@@ el was emb@@ ro@@ id@@ ered by a large number of female voters , and voters believed that p@@ id@@ ol will be dis@@ crimin@@ ating against female in@@ mates ' image in india , which has a serious concept of women , and will enhance female status .
the constitution stipulates that as a federal state , the president is the head of state and the president in the name of the state , to be in command , not to represent any political party , and more of this is a symb@@ ol .

us defense department officials said on the 23@@ rd that due to changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us department of defense is re@@ considering plans to cut the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .

the three functions of modern military uni@@ forms
first is recognition .
different countries ' armed forces are different in different arms , and the important h@@ all@@ marks of the armed forces and the people are different .
the world 's largest and more than 100 countries ' armed forces have basically similar military uni@@ forms , but no armed forces of any two countries are completely the same .
second is symbol@@ ic function .
to a certain degree , military uni@@ forms are not only a reflection of the mental state of a country but also a national military 's combat capability .
in his cour@@ t@@ es@@ y , he always played the most important role in the three categories of military uni@@ forms , dis@@ playing the appe@@ ti@@ te of the us@@ a .
third , it has the protection function .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weapons and equipment , the comprehensive protection capability of new - type military uni@@ forms has enabled the troops to defend against bul@@ lets , monitor the radi@@ ation of b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia , and diver@@ t the he@@ at and m@@ iti@@ g@@ ation and other diverse functions , and have become the primary problem in the development of military uni@@ form .

a few years ago , with the appearance of personnel , some of the housing units of this group were un@@ covered by regulations , making it difficult for the cadres to affor@@ d housing , and the officers and men had a relatively great opinion on this .
the group also had cle@@ ared the houses several times , and had to be resolved due to various obstruc@@ tions , making this problem a big difficulty .

the new party committee leadership group reached a consensus , and the principal leaders personally started to thoroughly clear up all problems in the housing occupation of houses in violation of regulations .

beijing , 13 july ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- yang bao@@ jin , reporter liu xin@@ xin reported that the whole army will gradually change its 2007 military uni@@ form from 1 august .
this evening , the china military network specially invited military materials department deputy director chen jun and company commander of the equipment research institute to be listed in the 2007 military uni@@ form design design with high - level engine@@ er su yang as guest of the chinese military uni@@ form . this was the background and development process of online friends from inside and outside the army and the civilian net - use ne@@ tiz@@ ens .

jing@@ jiang city 's arti@@ ficial system to improve the quality of cadres
on the morning of the same day , the military training center of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , which was opened to officers of the armed forces department of the xi@@ ul@@ ian town , was jointly presented by lu yu@@ qing , minister of the armed forces of the western region . the guidance class for the psychological warfare under the conditions of winning information technology was unanimously endorsed by the train@@ ees .
this is a new method for the military personnel management department to exert efforts to raise the overall quality of specialized military cadres in light of their actual positions .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during an investigation at the grassroots level that some cadres who were specially engaged in military service were not known for their posts , and were not placed in armed work .
therefore , they have adopted the method of concentrated training to rely on local party school training and conducted regular training for specialized arms cadres , and have worked hard to resolve the problem of un@@ it@@ ary professional quality of military cadres .
in connection with the central task , boldly set the tasks for cadres with special skills , and improve their abilities to work in posts through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments , jointly formulated the " program for appointing full - time cadres through competition " , clearly stipul@@ ating that the ministers of armed forces must be appointed to the leading body of the party committee and that they must not be removed from their posts .
and established a mechanism for the readjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills , and set up a mechanism for the timely adjustment and exchange of cadres with special skills that are not adap@@ ted to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level , and for those comrades who have a strong ability to make overall quality work .
not long ago , chen yi@@ p@@ ong , director of the armed forces department of the new century company limited , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to make new development in the under@@ water technology , which has filled the domestic industry and has been upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
good start still needs good treatment
as far as the result of the competition is concerned , the score for 2 - 2 is reasonable and also un@@ acceptable . the key lies in the process of the competition , and the degree of regre@@ ts is that .
if iran leads the world 2 - 0 , then m@@ m@@ m@@ m@@ ere equ@@ als , then the feeling of china 's m@@ im@@ e@@ th will be very long , the m@@ ood will be very high , the m@@ ood is the opposite of the situation .
the first course of the campaign is not good , but one can be said to be a m@@ old problem .
it is often not so easy to play the ball under the situation of the situation , and ordinary people 's views are not yet perfect in china 's psychological quality .
this is indeed a good thing that cannot be done well .
however , from the perspective of today 's competition , it seems to be the same .
sun ji@@ hai , sh@@ ao xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ jia , zheng zhi , and others did not say that li wei - feng and others had been the old players in the s@@ and field . they had seen the great knowledge and found that there would not be any problems in their psychological quality .
this m@@ iti@@ g@@ ation was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was that it would be a temporary move to deploy troops in order to make a m@@ ess .
the iranian team , under a back@@ war@@ dness , was replaced by two , and the situation was immediately turned into m@@ ere m@@ ere m@@ ere .
the second half was also the third m@@ im@@ e@@ ter , but the effect was not good .
to overcome the problem that a good start cannot be good and the end must be accurately found .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods for correc@@ ting the problems are probably not difficult to find .
they were afraid of being ill and ill .
if this goes on , it will be a game of more competition , and old problems will be broken , and it will not be able to be expected to be k@@ ic@@ ked further .
