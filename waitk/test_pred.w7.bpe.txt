experts believe that while the m@@ ere of insurance will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market funds in the short term ,
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures for the management of investment in foreign insurance funds " were recently promulgated , and insurance funds have a broader space for the use of the capital market .
china 's top investment official liu le@@ fei believes that the appreciation of the rmb and the improvement of the domestic capital market will not be possible in the short term through foreign exchange purchase , which also means that investment outside the country will not diver@@ t domestic stock markets funds in the short term .
it was reported that many insurance companies held the same view .
experts said that since there is no renminbi product market , insurance institutions are not able to resort to risk means , and the time for large - scale purchases of foreign currency is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , in the aspect of asset allocation , overseas investment should account for a certain proportion of the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the relatively large pressure of appreciation of the rmb at present , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
foreign exchange procurement projects that invest overseas should be handled with cau@@ tion under the current circumstances .

in july , the online bul@@ l@@ doz@@ er chen shui - bian [ chen shuibian ] questi@@ oned the judicial personnel on the island who attempted to involve themselves in the taiwan regional leadership election .
the administration of taiwan 's presidential expedi@@ tion , high t k@@ um@@ chi , said on the same day that the current performance of island 's judges is not in keeping with what chen shui - bian said , and asked chen shui - bian to give an explanation of his explanation .
according to a report in taiwan 's " kung pao " , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's prosecu@@ tor or investig@@ ators on 30 july . due to political factors or election considerations , it has interven@@ ed and even attempted to influence election activities of various party candidates , saying that he hopes this phenomenon will not exist in taiwan , but it is very difficult to do so .
in response to chen shui - bian 's doubts , taiwan 's president lev@@ in responded to the election of secretary general fan ku@@ ang - chi@@ u , while the speaker of the house of justice , fan ku@@ ang - ch ' un , represented the democratic progressive party [ dpp ] , spoke on the occasion of the democratic progressive party [ dpp ] in the legislative yuan .
k@@ ao k@@ ong@@ zhi said that the fundamental law and the code of judges on the taiwan straits have all declared that they should exceed the party 's requirements , and they should not take part in party activities , while judges are very cautious about observing the related rules and making known that they are very good for the judges to be held accoun@@ table in judicial bin@@ ding .
k@@ ao jin - che pointed out : kaohsiung , while si@@ k@@ ao chang , joined the k@@ ad@@ un@@ a school curriculum a few years ago , because the courses concerned have a color of political parties and a decision of the self - discipline committee , which is composed of judges .

germany to reduce thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of professional personnel
the first batch of new aircraft carrier formation of the pla is expected to be launched in ber@@ lin , july 1 .
german minister of education and scientific research sh@@ ay@@ un said recently that germany should lower the " method " for lim@@ iting the conditions for introducing foreign professional personnel , and resolve the problems facing germany 's professional talent problems by increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
the o@@ ec@@ d report said germany 's trade deficit with countries aged 15 to 64 will fall year by year .
if there are enough immigrants , then the labor force in germany will be 6 percent less than the current figure .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association reported that engine@@ ers have made great achievements in the current labor market in germany .
the labor department reported that in may this year , the labor market in germany had a total of 1@@ 27@@ ,000 workers , with around 10,000 technicians suppl@@ ying around 9@@ ,@@ 600 workers .
germany is playing an important role in protecting its own people 's employment and introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " on the method " stipulates that professional personnel from non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 50,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain the permission for working and living in germany .
sha wan suggested that this limit be lowered to around euro .

( china 's " on june 28 " ;
there are many legal problems , such as the restr@@ aints on the theoretical circle and the lim@@ it@@ ations of the united states , which mainly includes legal teaching and research work , etc. , while the more is engaged in legal inquir@@ ies , legal services , and other specific actions , such as legal services , etc. , in li@@ tig@@ ation .

the law can do whatever it can to keep the m@@ ere m@@ ere of the differences in the division of labor , and not to support each party with its support .
however , the bin@@ ding of lawyers ' law has obj@@ ectively recognized the legal theory in the process of reviewing law , which is higher than the legal profession 's judgment .
in fact , some people engaged in research on legal system and international laws and teaching purely , and their theories are much different from those of law .
in this way , the imper@@ ial system of the " imper@@ ial taxation " has undoubtedly opened up a very bad cur@@ tain on the bad cur@@ tain of the extremely bad influence .
on the theoretical circle of ours , super@@ sti@@ tion is more than these , such as experts and experts ' proof of this will often affect or even rej@@ ect court verdic@@ ts , and it is also a direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

after entering the door , this situation became even more serious . no matter how good y@@ a@@ xing was , it was conf@@ used and un@@ thin@@ kable .
some media reported that many foreign tourists to xian expressed their appreciation of the ancient sil@@ t in xian , but they also showed great concern for the number of pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ ks who have been allowed to re@@ ap a lot of money .
these include the cur@@ t on the train , which is a trip and the place of transportation and qu@@ iet , and the place should be civilized , orderly , harmonious , and a qu@@ iet environment for the qu@@ iet environment .

what is important is that these achievements are the window for building spiritual civilization in hong kong , while c@@ og@@ nition of the whole pan@@ thers , the loss is not only an image issue but also an impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to make a big and strong tourism industry , but use this chao@@ tic and ir@@ rational tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests coming to the south and to the north , who would like to come ?
how do you achieve economic results in your tourism ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , it will create a civilized tourist environment for tourists from northern and southern ti@@ ant@@ a .
while making things eas@@ ier , the operation of pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ kers should be standardized , and un@@ certified operations should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .

the united states has not re@@ war@@ ded the benefits of the poor .
the construction streets in beijing 's dong@@ cheng district , using electronic bul@@ k and other items as a reward for 12 low - income families who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ treat .
( " xin jing bao " 10 july )
this auth@@ or is happy for the improvement of the family life , but it still shows some good news about the initial re@@ treat of the ling@@ er , and still the practice of re@@ war@@ ding the old with the result that it is complicated .
the deputy director of the chi@@ h@@ un street office said that in response to the problems of che@@ ating and low - guarantee , this was a good example for other low - income households .
if it is to encourage other low - income insur@@ ers to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , then it is worth advocating that if it is to use this to s@@ ne@@ ak those who have been trying to s@@ wind@@ le those who have long been trying to keep low - income guarantees , they are not some n@@ ai@@ ve .
while differ@@ enti@@ ating and clearing the lo@@ op to lower households , it is more dependent on the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of low - income households that they must perform when enjoying the minimum insurance coverage : if they promptly report on changes in family members and income , report on the employment situation , and accept re@@ examination on a regular basis , the departments concerned should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , it is a long - term plan to restr@@ ain itself according to law .
the neighbor@@ hood reward the family that retired from the guarantee and give them a reward , who is the one who bur@@ ied the card ?
neighbor@@ hood is a primary government organization , and its expenditure is borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
and the money of the tax@@ pay@@ ers should not be used ?
on the one hand , families with@@ drawing from the minimum guarantee have proved that they have a certain self - sufficient ability , while on the other hand , do n't the people applying for low - income insurance still exist ?
the government appropri@@ ated funds , which are called the money - saving funds , should be used in the snow - covered but not for the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu di@@ an@@ yi 's wish to serve this is even more
on 10 july , the first public confidence in the county of lu@@ ji@@ u in the new metr@@ opol@@ it@@ an area , in the new territories , liu di@@ yi , accepted for the fourth time a democratic election after taking office , reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
after the reporter had a dialogue with liu di@@ an@@ yi , liu di@@ yi posi@@ tioned himself as a service provid@@ er .
( yesterday 's " xin jing bao " )
liu yi 's service on the card may be greater than some appointment systems of cadres . the service of cadres in the system is even more true . it makes people feel even more flu@@ ent .
the system of appointments in direct elections is most extensive in comparison with the system of direct elections . the former is mainly decided by ordinary party members on the source of power , and the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power has determined that the former must be held responsible to the people first .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom it is the fundamental factor that determin@@ es how the person elected will carry out his work .
some people doubt the democratic bul@@ l , which is even more like a democratic cur@@ tain .
my view is that it is like this democratic form , which is better than not .
considering the historical and current situation of china 's grassroots democratic political construction , i think that the public referendum direct election has already become a major breakthrough , and democratic is a major component of this breakthrough , which is not to be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

these adverse re@@ actions are ligh@@ tly up to the bu@@ b@@ ble and heavy to sudden heart attacks .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that now they have reached a conclusion that di@@ el@@ i@@ a@@ is is not safe .
the authority will hold a seminar on july 30 on the tex@@ as ' cur@@ t .

us defense department re@@ considers plans to cut us troops in europe
a us defense department official said on 23 march that due to changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is considering a plan to cut the us military presence in europe by about half .
the us media quoted a defense department official as saying that since the iraq war is still going on and relations between russia and iran are deterior@@ ating , the defense department has raised doubts about the feasibility of reducing the european military presence plan .
in addition , defense secretary donald rumsfeld announced that the united states will increase the number of troops stationed in europe from 11.@@ 5 to 7.@@ 71 before 20@@ 12 , and build a smaller house of troops with a smaller size of around 0.@@ 25 percent .
at present , the total number of us troops stationed in europe has dropped to around the corner .
however , in june this year , commander of the us european command , j@@ eff@@ re@@ y ko@@ e@@ ke , submitted a report to the current defense minister , asking questions about the reduction plan .
the report said that while the us forces stationed in europe and europe are reducing their troops , many troops are being deployed in iraq and afghanistan in turn , causing shortage of us military personnel in europe and making it impossible for them to carry out normal cooperation with their european allies .
the report sugg@@ ests that the plan to cut down the us forces stationed in europe should be stopped .

the three major functions of modern military uni@@ forms
first , recognition function .
different countries ' military systems , different arms of services , and different types of troops , are important indic@@ ators of the military and the people .
in the world , the military of more than 100 countries , big and small , is basically the same in military uni@@ form . however , there is no military uni@@ form of two countries , and it is completely the same .
second is symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are not only a reflection of the national spirit of a country 's but also a concentrated emb@@ odi@@ ment of the ability of a country 's military to fight a battle , but also a concentrated emb@@ odi@@ ment of the ability of a country 's military troops to fight a battle .

the design@@ ers of the 07 military uni@@ form are invited by the chinese military online
beijing , july 13 ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- report by reporter yang bao@@ jin and reporter liu xin@@ xin : the pla units will be changing their uni@@ form from 1 august .
this evening , the chinese military network specially invited military supplies to be used by chen jun , deputy director of the equipment bureau , and senior engine@@ er of the us military equipment research institute , the su yang , a desig@@ ner of the us military uni@@ form , as a guest of the chinese people . this has aroused a response among ne@@ tiz@@ ens in the internet users in the process of developing new military uni@@ forms and in the background of making up the new military uni@@ form .
the two guests are mr. xu xi@@ xin 's direct research and development of the 2007 military uni@@ form .
speaking about changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 07 - type military uni@@ form is particularly used in changing the 97 - type military uni@@ form , and it is held in the series of military uni@@ form , including the series of old - type r@@ ough - type form@@ ations , and so on , as many as several hundred improvements .
the biggest feature of the 07 style military uni@@ form is that it reflects the system of managing the system while transforming the functions of the system onto the human body . for the first time , the pla 's military uni@@ form system has met the standards of coordinating the three armed forces , with the combined varie@@ ties of the three armed forces , and has reached the standards of coordinating the three varie@@ ties of the armed forces , indicating that the level of the army 's military uni@@ form construction has achieved a historical leap .
the two honor@@ able guests also exchanged views on the r@@ ay of new military uni@@ forms , the narr@@ ow@@ ly - shap@@ ed design , and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
this time , the online , made up of china 's military network and china 's new wave network , was jointly held by china 's online online online .
the military attach ?? platform in jing@@ jiang city has raised the quality of the armed forces .
on the morning of the 25 th , a large - scale demonstration was held in jing@@ ji ribao , jiangsu province . officers of the armed forces department of the xi@@ lai town , lu yu@@ qing , was named the " win@@ ner in psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " l@@ ec@@ turing students who participated in the training .
this is a new method used by the armed forces departments in integrating their positions with their actual conditions , exer@@ ting efforts to improve the overall quality of the officers of the armed forces .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during an investigation and study at the grassroots level that some specially - armed cadres were appointed for a long time , while holding posts in the armed forces , they did not devote their main energ@@ ies to armed work .
therefore , they have adopted the method of concentrated training for cadres in the loc@@ ality relying on regular training for military cadres in military schools and worked hard to solve problems of un@@ it@@ ary quality of specialized military cadres in knowledge .
in connection with the central task , they boldly handed over their jobs to them , thus enhancing their ability to perform duties through on - the - job training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated a " program for appointing full - time military cadres " , clearly stipul@@ ating that armed forces minister enter the party committee leading body and stop taking other positions .
and established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging cadres of all types of armed forces , so that they could adjust and exchange certain age - old cadres who did not adapt to armed forces at the grassroots level , and select and use comrades who have good overall quality and great work ability .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , director of the armed forces department of the new century company limited , led the new under@@ water ship developed by the militi@@ a technical detachment , made up of domestic enterprises , and was upgraded to the company 's armed forces department .
good will still start to be good .
judging by the result of the match alone , the 2 - 2 score is reasonable , and it can also be accepted , and the key is the process of the match , so many people feel regre@@ tful .
if iran is ahead of the 2 - 0 , then will cause a cl@@ um@@ sy score , then china 's feeling is definitely different , it will have a long time , it will be very long , it will be in the opposite state of the country .
good start cannot end . it can be said that it is a old problem .
in fact , it is not a match that is usually a k@@ no@@ c@@ k on the situation . the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a sign that the m@@ ere can stop m@@ ending .
however , judging from today 's performance , it seems to be not as good as today .
sun j@@ im@@ ing , sh@@ ao ji@@ xiang , and others k@@ ick zheng ji@@ ach@@ i and others , who did not say anything about european s@@ and , li wei - feng and others , who had been old s@@ and fields for a long time , and they saw many things on the s@@ and field , and according to reason , there would not be any problems in their psychological quality .
this m@@ ud@@ dy was forced to settle by the iranian team , and i am afraid it will be on the stage of deployment of troops .
iran 's team was replaced by two men under backward conditions , and the match was immediately turned into a m@@ ere gl@@ u@@ t .
the lower half was also changed to three pres@@ ents , but the effect was not good .
to overcome the problem that good is not the only way to solve the problem , we must accurately find the root cause of the problem .
once the problem is accurately identified and the problem is correc@@ ted , it is probably not difficult to find out .
they are afraid to seek medical treatment in a hur@@ ry .
if this continues , it will play like a big game , and the old problem will make a mistake , and it will not be a further k@@ ick that everyone is exp@@ ecting .
