beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the pentagon of the united states recently formally submitted the " four - year defense evaluation report " to congress on the " four - year defense evaluation report " which was formally submitted to congress by the pentagon .
experts believe that this is unreasonable accusations against china 's normal national defense construction and plays up the <unk> of china 's military threat theory . it is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is the new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three expositions on china 's military power and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt to deal with the issue , and the report has been directly mentioned by the two - word chinese <unk> or <unk> . " the <unk> " is the most important and newly - developed big power in the united states . if the united states does not have anti - countermeasures measures . " if the united states does not fight the us side .
yao <unk> , a research fellow at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although the us senior officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time that the united states has made a new round of military threats to the united states in the <unk> national defense strategy report .

what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " us president bush also submitted to congress the government budget for 2007 , which was $ <unk> billion , of which national defense budget reached $ <unk> .
if the <unk> is in the military action that is added to iraq and afghanistan , the national defense budget for the us fiscal budget will break through the $ 500 - billion mark in 2007 , and the <unk> , the total military expenditure of <unk> , is almost equal to all other countries in the world .
peng guangqian believes that the trick of the united states creating a threat to other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's <unk> manufacturing and the true style of its enemy , and its real purpose is to gain more profits in the us arms industry .

the official data showed that in 2004 , china 's national defense spending declined nearly 10 percentage points in the same period of the same period in 1979 .
china 's defense budget is <unk> billion yuan in 2005 , only about one - 14 of the us national average , and its national military spending is only about one - 60 percent of the us military 's total military spending .
the united states has a total area of <unk> million us dollars and its total land area is quite large , but the military forces are so much in the defense of the defense .
peng guangqian said .
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively assess china 's military construction and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become rivals in the future .
the white paper on china 's national defense in 2004 said that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and implements defensive national defense policy .
china 's past and the present no future pose a threat to any country .

hamas seeks breakthrough in cabinet formation .
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 , by the end of february , hamas seeks to break a cabinet plan .
xinhua news agency , wang hao , wang hao , .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a new government blueprint , which is the focus of international attention at present .
what new policies will hamas pursue in the course of the peace process directly affect the relevant policy orientation of the next step of the corresponding policy .
at the same time , the us and israeli resistance attitudes have added variables to the future of hamas .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations and the difficulties and sensitive points in the development of the cabinet will be actively sought .
the prime minister 's posts have fallen by <unk> .
after hamas won the cabinet , some people worried that hamas prime minister <unk> might be able to meet with the current supreme leader abbas .
moreover , hamas leader hamas , who is visiting egypt , stressed that hamas will not recognize israel 's new government , which is not recognized by israel , and this hard signal also aggravated the international concern .
the united states and israel clearly stated that they would not accept the hamas government with real power and threatened to cut off the economic aid and transfer of tax to palestine .
however , this does not hamper the flexibility of hamas 's flexible tactics to adjust its independent and independent figures .
it is reported that to maximize the international recognition of the world , the hamas leaders at home and abroad decided to elect <unk> <unk> , chairman of the board of directors of the independent school of the people 's republic of china .
this move has not yet received responses from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , <unk> , said that the most crucial thing is to do so as to the prime minister 's choice of the <unk> , the most crucial thing to do , and the success of the cabinet .
how to distribute power ? .
in terms of internal , the biggest challenge to hamas 's cabinet is lack of sufficient governance experience .
an article in palestine 's " daily newspaper " analyses the fact that the hamas has managed to gain popularity through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in the field of governance , and the palestinian national liberation movement ( plo ) , which has the experience of ruling the country , is the best policy .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partner of the united states , which was established in the united states , and jointly formed a national coalition government . however , fatah has not given positive response to this .
the fatah faction is divided into the cabinet , and it stands for a new government to participate in the new administration , and it is willing to do something to do a good job in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that with the persuasion of abbas , fatah gradually tends to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also bargain with the fatah cabinet .
another way is to establish a legislative council framework outside the framework of the legislative council .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a specialist type of government , but it is unclear about the list .
in view of the us and israeli attitudes , technical experts are also able to form a form of cabinet - forming form .
according to the provisions of the " basic law " of palestine , after the new legislative committee was inaugurated on 16 june , the prime minister nominated the prime minister to complete the work of the prime minister within three weeks to five weeks .
where will armed forces go ? .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem facing the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and resolutely demands hamas to abandon violence and reject the armed participation in the administration of the state .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 august that the armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces are in fact the subject of the two sides of the armed forces .
hamas 's first largest party in the world has been elected by the united states . " the first party is the first to be elected by the government . " .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of various factions unify the armed forces of the palestinian national authority , but they have not received a wide - ranging response , and they have also met the criticism of the islamic jihad of the islamic holy war organization of palestine .
the palestinian authority has a security agency of over 60,000 security personnel .
moreover , fatah also has a loose armed faction with a number of relations with the <unk> , such as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , fatah , and other fatah - based fatah brigades .
hamas must be responsible for the establishment of a new - type of security mechanism .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to charge security and intelligence forces , and the police , police , and civil defense departments are under the control of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue so far there is no follow - up .
