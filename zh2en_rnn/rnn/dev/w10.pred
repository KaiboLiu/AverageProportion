xinhua news agency , wang hao , wong min - huang , .
palestinian islamic resistance movement wins election after victory in the election , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government to become a focus of attention at present .
what new policies will hamas implement in order to directly affect the relevant policy orientation of the next step of the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israeli resistance attitude has added more variables to the future of hamas .
at present , all parties are stepping up consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet in the future , and actively seeking breakthroughs in the future development of the cabinet .
premier 's posts in the premier 's posts fell <unk> .
after hamas won the power of forming a cabinet , some people were worried that hamas 's prime minister <unk> might have differences with the current supreme leader abbas .
and the hamas leader who is visiting egypt stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel 's new government , and this tough signal has also aggravated the international concern .
the united states and israel explicitly stated that hamas , which is not in power , will not accept the hamas government , and it will threaten the economic aid and to the palestinian side to be cut off .
however , this does not hamper the flexibility of hamas 's flexible strategy to adjust the election , and the election of independent figures is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest amount of international recognition , the leaders of the two countries , who have been in egypt , decided to elect <unk> chairman of the board of directors of the independent council of the country .
this move has not yet received response from the relevant authorities .
palestinian analysts said that no matter how the premier 's job is , the most crucial thing is to reduce the <unk> of hamas 's hard - line soft line , and only thus can it ensure the success of the cabinet .
how should power distribution be assigned ? .
from internal to external , the biggest challenge to hamas is that there is insufficient experience in governance .
an article in the palestinian " daily newspaper " analyzed that the hamas has been able to gain popularity through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing the country .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partnership with fatah , and jointly organized a national coalition government to jointly set up a national coalition government .
the fatah faction is divided into different factions , and it stands for a new government and has become a new government , and the other faction refuses to accept the invitation of hamas .
the informed source pointed out that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually tended to join the new government .
even if hamas and fatah will be able to bargain with the cabinet , they will be able to bargain with the cabinet .
in addition , the other way is to set up a cabinet framework outside the framework of the legislative yuan .
it is reported that hamas also design a type of expert type of government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , technical experts are also able to form a form of cabinet - forming form of a cabinet .
according to the basic law of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council has nominated the prime minister to form a cabinet after the inauguration of the new legislative yuan on 16 march .
what course is armed ( subhead ) armed forces ? .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem facing the establishment of the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and it is strongly demanding that hamas abandon violence and reject the armed forces ' participation in political affairs .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 september that armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization of the organization of the organization .
the armed forces ' issue of armed forces is in fact a question of the legality of the legality of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas elected in the form of democracy and freedom , the first party is recognized by the international community , and al qassam brigade , a militant faction under the organization , is also trying to unify its own security system .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of all factions be divided into <unk> , the palestinian national authority , but they have not received extensive response , and they have also been criticized by the islamic jihad organization of palestine .
the majority of the palestinian people have a security of 60,000 .
moreover , fatah also has a number of armed factions under loose relations , such as the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigades , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> .
hamas must be responsible for the formation of the armed forces that can manage these things in an effort to manage the armed forces in their own ways , and reasonably distribute security management powers .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to charge security and intelligence , and police , the police , and civil defense departments are controlled by the ministry of internal affairs .
however , the parties still hold consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no follow - up .
