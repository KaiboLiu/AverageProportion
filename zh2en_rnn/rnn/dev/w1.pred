the united states and israel are very tough and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to take part in the government 's participation in government affairs .
hamas leader <unk> <unk> stressed on 9 november that the armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces are in fact the most important issue of the legality of the arms race and the ownership management of the armed forces .
hamas has adopted democracy and freedom in the form of democracy and freedom . the first largest party has been recognized by the hamas - led hamas <unk> <unk> as a <unk> route to the government . the israeli government will be divided into the government 's security agency .
hamas has proposed to put forward the " three represents " as the palestinian national authority , and the people of the region have not received extensive response , but also have met with the islamic jihad of the islamic jihad of the palestinian islamic jihad .
the palestinian authority has a total of 60,000 security personnel , and the majority of the fatah members are from fatah .
and the fatah also has some members of the organization of the fatah organization , such as <unk> al-aqsa martyrs brigade , <unk> <unk> , and other members of the fatah - led fatah party .
