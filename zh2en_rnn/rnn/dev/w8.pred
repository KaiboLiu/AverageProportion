beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the united states pentagon recently reported to congress a " four - year defense evaluation report " submitted to congress by the pentagon for the first time , which is the most likely new power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a groundless accusation against china 's normal national defense construction , and plays a role in interfering in the military theory of china .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new guiding document for the pentagon 's new national defense .
the 92 - page report used three paragraphs of chinese military power and the response to the us countermeasures . the report has directly mentioned the <unk> china 's <unk> or <unk> china . the report has directly mentioned the two phrases of the <unk> china , as a major and emerging big power . china is the most competitive and the united states has no countermeasures . if the united states does not have any countermeasures , it is very likely that the united states will develop its superiority in conventional weapons .
zhang <unk> , researcher of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions , this was the first time that the united states had made a new military challenge to the united states in the us military strategy report .
the report for the first time clearly defined russia 's <unk> , as a new strategic rival , in particular , in particular , the so - called <unk> china threat theory has given more attention to the so - called <unk> china threat theory .
major general peng guangqian , a researcher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said : .
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " us president bush also submitted to congress the government budget for 2007 , of which the national defense budget reached $ <unk> billion .
if the <unk> is in the military action that has been added to iraq and afghanistan , the national defense budget for the fiscal year 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , creating a new historical record , and <unk> <unk> said that the total amount of <unk> is almost all the other countries ' military spending .
peng guangqian maintained that the tricks of the united states creating the threat of the threat of other countries ' threat of the threat of the threat of the threat of the threat of the enemy have reflected the consistent style of the pentagon in creating enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and reap more profits from the us huge arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has participated in the military experts ' written writings on the chinese national defense white papers on many occasions , and since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of national defense spending has declined .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditure dropped by nearly 10 percentage points over the same period of 1979 .

the land area of the united states and the land area of china are roughly quite large , but the difference in military spending is so huge .
peng guangqian said : .
the director of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jianqun , said that the us side should objectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become rivals in military affairs .
the white paper on national defense in 2004 says china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy .
china has not yet been able to pose a threat to any country in the past and now .
so far , china has not established military bases in other countries nor has dispatched troops to other countries , while the united states has a hundred military bases abroad , only in asia alone , deployed over 100,000 troops in asia .
zhu feng , professor at the institute of international relations of beijing university , said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the existing channels , increase understanding and mutual trust , and promote the constructive and cooperative relations between the two countries in the new century .

hamas to seek breakthrough in cabinet for new cabinet .
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 , hamas 's cabinet to seek breakthroughs in forming a cabinet for breakthrough in the cabinet .
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang min - min .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement won the election after the election of the legislative council . how to draw up a new blueprint for the government is the focus of attention at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue in the future ? .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added more variables to the future of hamas .
at present , all palestinian parties are stepping up consultations and the difficulties and sensitive points that involve the future situation in the future development of the cabinet .
the premier 's position is to be used to save the post of prime minister .
after hamas won the cabinet , some people worried that hamas would probably be able to hold talks with the current supreme leader abbas .
moreover , hamas leader <unk> , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel 's new government , which has also intensified its international worries .
the united states and israel clearly stated that hamas , which is not willing to hold real power , has threatened to stop the economic aid and to the palestinian side for its economic aid to palestine .
however , this does not obstruct the hamas 's flexible strategic adjustment , and the independence of independent individuals is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international recognition , leaders of the arab league of hamas , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to appoint <unk> <unk> , chairman of the board of directors of the independent people 's university of china .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
the palestinian government has been working hard to make the most important choice for the prime minister 's post , the palestinian analyst said . " the government is not able to make sure that the cabinet is a strong supporter of the cabinet .
how should power distribution be allocated ? .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas 's cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governing .
an article in the " daily newspaper " of palestine analyzed that the use of social welfare projects by the hamas has been in the process of being in power , but the national liberation movement of the palestinian national liberation movement has been the best policy .
hamas proposed a political partner of <unk> - <unk> relations with fatah after the election , and the fatah government has not given a positive response to the issue so far .
fatah is currently divided into the cabinet , and it is a one that advocates participation in the new government , and the other faction refuses to invite hamas to make a positive opposition and a positive opposition party .
the informed source pointed out that with abbas ' persuasion , fatah gradually tends to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also be able to mediate the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to form a framework for the legislative council to break away from party affiliation .
it is reported that hamas also designed a single expert - type government , but no specific list was known .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , technical experts can also be a form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council has nominated prime minister and cabinet members to complete the election within the new legislative council on 16 march .
armed forces should follow the path of armed forces and to follow the path of development .
the weapons of hamas are another thorny problem facing the establishment of the new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and resolutely demands hamas abandon violence and to reject the political participation of the armed forces .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 september that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization of the organization .
the armed forces have the right to use the weapons of the armed forces to be the same as the two sides ' armed forces .
the election of the first largest party in the world was the first time that hamas was elected by the democratic and freedom method . the <unk> al qassam brigade , which was under the leadership of the hamas , was also a way of legalizing its security organization .
hamas once proposed that all factions of the palestinian armed forces be able to make the palestinian people a <unk> of the palestinian national authority , but they have not received extensive response from the palestinian islamic jihad .
at present , there are more than 60,000 security personnel in the palestinian - israeli security organization .
moreover , the armed factions under fatah have a <unk> of their subordinate organizations , such as the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , <unk> al-aqsa martyrs brigade , <unk> , fatah , and other fatah martyrs .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach unanimity with abbas on how to manage these armed forces , and rationally distribute security management power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to charge security and intelligence units , and police and civil defense departments are divided by the ministry of interior of the new government .
however , the parties concerned are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue so far .
