chinese experts : us military threat to china 's military threat .
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to send a strong delegation to the congress to submit the four - year defense evaluation report to the congress , the pentagon said today . the pentagon said in a recent report .
experts believe that this is a major reason for china 's normal national defense construction , and it plays a <unk> of the chinese military threat . it is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new national defense guiding document .
the 92 page report used three paragraphs to expound china 's military strength and the united states ' countermeasures . the report was 15 times directly mentioned . the report directly mentioned the chinese <unk> or <unk> china 's <unk> . said <unk> as a major one and emerging . " " china most enjoys the most extensive military competition with the united states . " if the united states does not contain countermeasures ; china is very likely to develop its own military technology ; and thus break the us superiority in traditional weapons .
the world 's military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao <unk> , said that although the us senior officials have repeatedly expressed similar viewpoints , this is the first time that the united states has made a military challenge to the united states in the report of the national defense strategy report of the united states .
the report was made for the first time in the report to be made by the russian <unk> , india , as a new strategic opponent , and in particular , the so - called <unk> china threat has given more attention to the so - called " <unk> " theory .
peng guangqian , a researcher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said : .
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report , " us president bush also submitted a report to the congress for fiscal year 2007 , including the national defense budget , which was $ <unk> billion .
if the <unk> is in iraq and afghanistan , it will add additional budget in 2007 to the us budget for 2007 - us $ 500 billion , creating a new record high . <unk> said that this is almost equivalent to the military expenditure of all other countries in the world .
peng guangqian maintained that the theory of the united states ' theory of creating a <unk> other country reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's <unk> , which is the last reason for the us to make its own efforts to achieve more national defense budget .
experts say that the huge military spending of the united states is quite limited .
he has participated in the military expert deng <unk> , who has been written on many occasions for the military 's defense white paper , said that since the 1990 s , china has increased its national defense expenditures , but the proportion of national defense spending in the same period has declined .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures accounted for a drop of nearly 10 percentage points in the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 is <unk> billion yuan , only about one - 14 of the us , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about one - 60 of the us military 's per capita military spending .
the us territory and china 's territory are roughly a large area , but the military spending is so huge . the military spending is so large that the military strength is beyond the normal defense needs .
peng guangqian said .
the china arms control and disarmament association , director of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively assess the situation in china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become rivals in the future .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and has implemented a defensive national defense policy .
china has not yet made any progress in the future and will not pose any threat to any country in the past .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , and the united states has a hundred military bases overseas , and only over 100,000 military bases in the united states have deployed over 100,000 troops in the asian region .
professor zhu feng of the institute of international relations of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between the two countries in the new century .

xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , wang <unk> , wang <unk> .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a victory after the election of the legislative council . how to draw a new government blueprint for the current international community is the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy will hamas carry out directly to the next step of the peace process in the next phase of the peace process ? .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added variables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all sides are stepping up consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet and a positive seeking for the future development of the future situation .
premier wen jiabao 's post is a major step forward in the development of the party 's position as a political party .
after hamas won the cabinet , some people were worried that hamas prime minister <unk> might be able to reconcile with the current top leader abbas .
moreover , the hamas leader who is visiting egypt stressed that hamas led by hamas was not recognized by hamas . this tough signal also intensified . this was also exacerbated by international anxiety .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that hamas , which is not acceptable to the real power , has threatened to cut the economic aid to palestine and to palestine to pass on taxes .
however , this does not hamper hamas 's strategic adjustment of its strategy , and the election is a compromise .
according to reports , in order to achieve the maximum international recognition , the leaders of the arab countries who have gathered in egypt recently decided to elect the chairman of the board of directors of the new prime minister , <unk> <unk> , as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received response from relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that no matter how the post of prime minister was , the most crucial thing was to lessen hamas 's tough <unk> and <unk> , only so can the success of the cabinet be ensured .
the power of power distribution should be distributed .
from the internal perspective , the greatest challenge facing hamas is lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily newspaper said that hamas 's passage of the social welfare program has been a popular , but the lack of experience in governance is not in the process of the national liberation movement ( fatah ) .
hamas has proposed to establish a political partner relationship with fatah after the election , and to jointly establish a national coalition government , but fatah has not given a positive response to this .
the fatah faction has different opinions on whether the cabinet faction is the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government will be able to do something to do something that is willing to do so .
the informed source pointed out that under the persuasion of abbas , fatah gradually became a new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold a referendum on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another channel is to establish a legislative committee framework outside the party 's political party .
it is reported that hamas also designed a single expert government , but it is not known to the public .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , technical experts are also a form of a form of a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the " basic law , " the new legislative committee of the state council has nominated the premier to form a cabinet in the next three weeks after the inauguration of the new legislative committee on 16 march .
armed forces should follow the path of course of course .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem facing the government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and resolutely demands that hamas abandon violence and reject the participation of the government in the country .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the <unk> strategy of the organization .
the armed forces ' armed forces are in fact a matter of the legitimacy of the arms and the armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , was elected the first party to recognize the international recognition of the international recognition , and al qassam brigade , which was subordinate to the international community , also legalized its unity with the government 's security agency .
hamas has proposed that all factions be divided into a palestinian national authority , but it does not receive extensive response from the palestinian islamic jihad , and has been met by the islamic jihad of the islamic jihad of palestine .
the palestinian authority has more than 60,000 security personnel , and the majority of the palestinians are from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah has some subordinate armed factions that are lax in organization , such as the <unk> martyrs ' brigades , the <unk> martyrs brigade , and other <unk> .
hamas , which is responsible for forming cabinet , must hold a consensus with abbas on how to manage these armed forces , and reasonably distribute the power for security management .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to take charge of security and intelligence , and the police and the civil defense department are being placed under the control of the new government .
however , the parties also have consultations on this sensitive issue so far .
