the united states and israel explicitly stated that they would not accept the hamas government , which was real power , and threatened to cut off the economic aid to palestine and to the palestinian side .
however , this does not hamper hamas 's flexibility in making a flexible choice , and the election of independent people is a compromise policy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the maximum approval of internationally accepted , the chinese people 's association for internal and international affairs of egypt recently decided to elect a chairman of the board of directors of the independent commission of directors of the new prime minister .

the chinese government has always been the key to the distribution of power .
from within the country , hamas 's cabinet is facing the greatest challenge to the ruling party .
the " daily daily " of palestine 's " daily daily " analyzed that the use of social welfare projects by hamas has been a result of the lack of experience , but the party lacks experience in the ruling party .

fatah 's internal affairs are divided into two factions , and the one - china principle is a favor of the government . the other faction has refused to be invited to be a <unk> , and the other faction is willing to make a positive opposition .
the informed source pointed out that the united states has gradually tended to join the new government .
even if the hamas and fatah are in power , the allocation of the seats of the cabinet will be held .
another two - way permit is set up outside the legislative council framework to separate the party from party nature .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a single - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts are also a form of form of a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative committee nominated by the prime minister will be nominated by the prime minister within three weeks after the new legislative council takes office .
the chinese armed forces should follow the path of " one country , two systems " and make sure that the armed forces are not allowed to follow the path of " one country , two systems . " .
the weapons of hamas are the new government 's new faces .
the united states and israel have a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and reject the armed forces ' armed forces to participate in the political affairs of the country .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 september that armed resistance was the <unk> strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces are in fact the legality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas has adopted a democratic and free method to be elected first party in the international community , and the party 's armed factions have also legalized the palestinian - israeli camp . it is also a way to be reunited with the government 's security agency .
hamas has proposed that all factions be divided into the palestinian national authority , <unk> , but the people 's army has not received widespread response , and has also been met with the islamic jihad of the palestinian islamic jihad ( jihad ) .
palestine has 60,000 security organizations , and most of them are from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah also has some loose armed factions , such as the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigades , who are <unk> , and others .
the hamas government must be held responsible for the management of these armed forces , which are in charge of these self - defense forces , and reasonably distribute security management power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence , and police , police , and civil defense agencies are placed under the jurisdiction of the new government .
however , the parties concerned are still conducting consultations on this sensitive issue so far .
