xinhua news agency , beijing , june 14 , .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of a legislative council after the victory of the legislative council . how to draw a new government blueprint has become a focus of attention at present .
hamas will implement what kind of new policy is directly affecting the peace process in the next step of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added a greater variables to the future of hamas .
at present , the palestinian side is stepping up consultations and consultations with the parties concerned on the future development of the cabinet .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the work of the party and the people .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people worry that the prime minister of hamas may have differences with the current supreme leader abbas .
moreover , the egyptian side is visiting egypt , which is currently on a visit to egypt , to emphasize that the palestinian government will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also intensified international worries .
the united states and israel clearly stated that they would not accept the hamas government , which was a power to be cut off from the power of the palestinian government .
however , this does not obstruct hamas from making a flexible strategy . the election is an independent and a compromise .
according to reports , in order to maximize the international recognition , the egyptian government recently gathered in egypt to elect an independent person , <unk> , and <unk> , chairman of the board of directors of the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts have said that no matter how the prime minister 's job is falling , the prime minister is the prime minister as far as possible . the prime minister is the only way to ensure that the cabinet is defeated .
the chinese government has always attached importance to the distribution of power .
from internal perspective , hamas is facing the biggest challenge facing the cabinet . it is not enough to have sufficient experience in governing .
the " daily " report of palestine said that hamas had been able to gather the popularity of the people through social welfare projects , but it lacked experience in governing , and the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) was the best to be in the best policy .
hamas has been putting forward the proposal to establish a political partnership with fatah , and to jointly establish a coalition government . however , fatah has not given a positive response until now .
fatah 's internal affairs are now divided into two different opinions , and one advocates participation in the new government , and the other faction refuses to accept hamas 's invitation and is willing to make a positive response to the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that in abbas ' persuasion , fatah gradually tends to join the new government .
even if hamas and fatah will also hold a meeting on the allocation of cabinet positions .
in addition , another channel is to establish a framework outside the legislative council , which is out of the party 's political affiliation .
according to reports , hamas also designed a military type of expert , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts of the technology experts are also a form of reducing external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the united states will be able to make a decision on the nomination of prime minister after the new legislative council 's inauguration on 16 may .
the chinese government has always been armed with the armed forces .
hamas 's arms are the first to be formed by the new government .
the united states and israel have a very tough attitude , and they resolutely demand hamas to abandon violence and reject its armed forces .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 july that the armed resistance is the <unk> strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces ' armed forces are actually the legal system of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
the hamas government has been using the method of democracy and freedom to win the first largest party in the world , and its armed forces have been legalized by hamas 's abu sayyaf brigade in the government 's security agency .
hamas once proposed that all factions have been divided into the palestinian national authority , <unk> , but , however , not received extensive response , and also met the islamic jihad ( jihad ) .
palestine has 60,000 people at present . it is most important for the overwhelming majority of fatah 's fatah factions .
moreover , fatah has some organization and loose armed forces . for example , the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , and other <unk> , the al-aqsa martyrs brigades , were also <unk> .
the government of hamas must be responsible for the administration of the armed forces of these countries , and rationally distribute the power of security management .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to charge security and intelligence forces , and police , police , and other organizations have been under the control of the interior ministry .
however , all parties are still discussing the sensitive issue . so far , there are no follow - up reports .
