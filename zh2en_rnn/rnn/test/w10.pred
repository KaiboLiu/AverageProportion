however , the lawyer law of the " law on lawyers " was <unk> , which was objectively recognized by the legal profession in the legal profession .
in fact , some legal research and teaching experts and scholars engaged in the legal theory of legal system in the legal system are incompatible with the law .
this is no doubt a <unk> law for the law - enforcement profession , which has been a bad example of the law of the law .
the superstitious belief in the <unk> theory of <unk> is not only in these cases but also the experts ' comments and experts ' meetings and the phenomenon of the court 's judgment .

no matter whether it is cars or train , the train will get to the bus and the <unk> of the <unk> will be crushed .

these include the public places of the station , which are located in the area of <unk> scenic area , and this is a place where the people are in the process of leisure and in a quiet and harmonious way .
the free and accessible business of the vendors has disrupted the tourists ' <unk> , and objectively undermined public order in these public places , thus forming a visual and environmental pollution , and also provided the conditions and opportunities for lawless elements to create trouble .
what is important is that these public places are the window for the building of spiritual civilization in the local areas , and eyewitnesses are seen seeing the <unk> and damage to the entire picture .
just imagine , you want to do a big job in tourism , but to welcome the guests of the tourist industry to welcome the guests who are in a mess . who is willing to come to the fore ? .
how do you have achieved benefits for your tourist economy ? .
with the arrival of the tourist season , the tourist industry has created a tourist environment for tourists . it should be said that the top priority is the most pressing task .
public places are not the market for the market , and the operation of the <unk> hawker should be standardized and the operation of illegal activities should be resolutely eliminated .
a civilized environment can be made and a good time for visitors to come to the fore , and return to the next stage .
one sentence , public places are not allowed to be bothered by the vendors .
