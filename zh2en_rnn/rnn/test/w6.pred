this includes the public places of the station , which are located in the scenic area of the station , and should be taken into account and should be carried out in a quiet and harmonious manner .
the free flow of the vendors has disrupted the <unk> of tourists , and objectively undermined public order in these public places and created a visual pollution and environmental pollution , and at the same time provided a favorable condition and opportunity for lawbreakers to stir up trouble .
the important thing is that these public places are window - building for local spiritual civilization , and the <unk> and the damaged pieces are not only a matter of image , but also a result of the impact of the local economic development .
just imagine , you should make a big trip to the tourism industry , but we use this kind of chaotic tourist environment to welcome the guests who are still in the midst of a <unk> . who dare to come ? .
how do you achieve economic results ? .
with the arrival of tourism peak , the tourist attraction created by the tourist industry has created a civilized tourist environment .
public places are not the market 's business behavior , and the operation of the <unk> should be standardized , and the illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized environment can only enable tourists to come to the country and enjoy a good time .
in a word , public places are annoyed by the vendors .

deputy director of the <unk> street office said that the <unk> was aimed at encouraging the people to take the initiative to take the initiative to protect their low - income and other problems , and they should take the initiative to take the initiative to make the other low - income families .
this example should be encouraged by the encouragement of other low - income personnel to extricate themselves from their difficulties . if they want to use their own efforts to help them , they will be somewhat naive .
in terms of distinction and the work of ensuring the real low - income families , more rely on the law to be the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen their low - guarantee safety while enjoying low protection : timely notification of family members and income changes will be reported to the department , and the relevant departments will be increased by the time of the review .
after all , the <unk> will be able to guarantee the security of the <unk> .
the streets are rewarded with a real - time reward of <unk> million households , who are buried in the streets .
as a primary government organization , the street is borne by the financial appropriations .
the taxpayers ' money should not be <unk> .
on the one hand , the withdrawal of the families from low - protected families proves that they have already possessed a certain amount of self - sufficient self - sufficiency capability , and the number of those applying for low protection is not still still existent ? .
the government financial appropriations for saving money should be provided timely and not adding to the brocade .

this is the first time that the municipal department of the municipality has put pressure on cadres with special efforts to pressure cadres with special force and put forward new changes in the overall quality of cadres .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the armed forces department of the armed forces of the people 's armed forces discovered that the term of office of some cadres was long and that the term of office was too long , and there was no work in the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they have adopted a centralized training method to support the training of local party schools and other methods to train specialized military cadres to meet the requirements of the special force of military cadres .

if iran leads the team , then the chinese team will tie the score , and the feeling of the chinese soccer fans will certainly be different . it is a long - term , pity .
the good start can be said to be the chinese team 's old problems .
the chinese team is often the best in the situation and will not play soccer in the situation .
this is indeed a good thing that china cannot eat at all .
however , the chinese team 's competition is not just like this .

the chinese team also changed three players in the second half , but the results were not good .
we should overcome the problem of good - neighborliness , benevolence , and bad things , and must find the root causes of the problem .
if the problem is accurately found , the method of change is probably not difficult to find .
fearing that they would be afraid of throwing out the disease , they would be afraid of being thrown into disorder .
if this way , the chinese team will play more matches , and the old problem will still be committed , and it will not be the kick - off of everyone .
