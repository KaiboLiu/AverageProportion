this example is a good example if we encourage other low - guaranteed workers to get rid of their difficulties through their own efforts , but if they want to use this opportunity to influence those who have long been deceived by the low - income , they will be somewhat naive .
in light of the work of differentiating between real and real - life households , we should rely more on the law .

this is a major contribution to the work of the armed forces of the people 's armed forces in the light of reality , and the new changes in the overall quality of the specialized personnel have been made .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the armed forces unit discovered that some specialized personnel were working for a long time , and too many of them were engaged in the work of arming their posts with too many jobs .
for this reason , they have adopted a concentrated training of <unk> to rely on local party schools to train the training of specialized personnel , and focus on the limited training of specialized personnel in the field of specialization and competence .

if iran leads the team , the team will be <unk> , and the chinese team will definitely not be the same as the chinese soccer fans . it is a very long way to go .
the good thing is that we can not be good at eventually saying that it is a old problem in china .
the chinese team often will not play soccer in the situation of the good situation , and ordinary people think that the chinese players are not competent in the psychological quality of the chinese players .
this is indeed a good reason for the chinese team to do so .
however , judging from the chinese team 's competition today , it seems that it is not so .
sun xiang , sun xiang , sun xiang , zheng <unk> , zheng zhi , and others , did not say that li wei and others were also <unk> , and they were also <unk> . they said that psychological quality would not be any problem .

overcome the problem of good - bye to the end , and find the root cause of problems .
if the problem is accurately identified , the methods for changing the problem of the problem are probably not difficult to find .
fearing that they would be thrown into the hospital for medical treatment .
if this goes on , the chinese team will play more matches , and the old problem will be even more serious , and it will not be possible to talk about what we expect to go further .
