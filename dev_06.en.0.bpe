with chick@@ en markets in europe pl@@ um@@ me@@ ting from the impact of virus incidents , the european commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to pan@@ ic .
ky@@ pri@@ an@@ ou , the european commissioner for health and food safety , said it is understand@@ able that the public is concerned , but there is no need to over@@ re@@ act .
following an earlier measure creating three - kilome@@ ter protection zones and 10 - kilome@@ ter surveillance zones around out@@ breaks of the virus , the european commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a " bu@@ f@@ fer zone " in the entire region of europe where the virus has been discovered .

china 's new management rules for e@@ -@@ banking operations to take effect on march 1
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 6 ( correspon@@ dents han jie and xu bo ) on the 6@@ th , reporters learned from the china banking regulatory commission that the measures for administration of e@@ -@@ banking business and the security evaluation guidance on e@@ -@@ banking issued recently by the c@@ br@@ c will take effect on march 1 , 2006 .
a c@@ br@@ c spokesperson said that according to the rules of the measures for administration , relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged , that is , after a foreign bank branch is approved to initi@@ ate e@@ -@@ banking operations , if new types of e@@ -@@ banking operations need to be added , the main reporting office in china for such bank branch should submit a uni@@ form application for review and approval .
in order to standardize e@@ -@@ banking operations of commercial banks , the people 's bank of china promulgated the interim measures for administration of e@@ -@@ banking business in june 2001 .
the c@@ br@@ c spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e@@ -@@ banking operations , the interim measures can no longer meet the requirements of e@@ -@@ banking risk supervision . therefore , the c@@ br@@ c formulated these two new rules .
according to the introduction by the c@@ br@@ c spokesperson , c@@ br@@ c ac@@ cred@@ itation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approv@@ als concerning the entrance elig@@ ibility of industries or enterprises . it is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e@@ -@@ banking security evaluation business , but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions .
as long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements , even if it does not have c@@ br@@ c ac@@ cred@@ itation , financial institutions can still h@@ ire it to conduct e@@ -@@ banking security evaluation , though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations .
the measures for administration of e@@ -@@ banking business include 99 articles under nine chap@@ ters , with the nine sections covering general provisions , applications and amendments , risk management , administration of data exchange and transfer , out@@ s@@ our@@ cing business , administration of transnational business , supervision and management , legal obligations , and by - laws .
the security evaluation guidance on e@@ -@@ banking includes 57 articles under five chap@@ ters , with the five sections covering general provisions , security evaluation institutions , implementation of security evalu@@ ations , administration of security evaluation activities , and by - laws .

( selected ex@@ cer@@ p@@ ts from newspapers and magaz@@ ines ) shanghai : mo@@ on@@ ligh@@ ters and college graduates become main h@@ our@@ ly work@@ force
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 7 the shanghai labor and social security bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for h@@ our@@ ly workers on the 6@@ th . the number of job positions reached 120 , 11 more than the previous time , while the prev@@ ailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases .
according to estimates by relevant experts at the shanghai labor and social security bureau , currently the number of h@@ our@@ ly workers in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a china youth daily report , the h@@ our@@ ly work@@ force is mainly composed of college graduates and mo@@ on@@ ligh@@ ters .
a direct survey of nearly 8,000 h@@ our@@ ly workers found more than half of them are mo@@ on@@ ligh@@ ters , accounting for 5@@ 1.1 % .
in general , mo@@ on@@ ligh@@ ters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more techn@@ ically focused work . for instance , among transl@@ ation - related jobs , the percentage of mo@@ on@@ ligh@@ ters has reached 8@@ 1.7 % , while it has reached 6@@ 1.6 % for people in fit@@ ness professi@@ ons .
high wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as h@@ our@@ ly workers .
it was learned that some specific positions such as simultane@@ ous interpre@@ ters can ear@@ n monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand . most h@@ our@@ ly workers such as fre@@ el@@ ance account@@ ants or masters of ceremony at wed@@ dings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month .
satis@@ fying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why h@@ our@@ ly work appeals to people .
for example , mr. gu , a human resources manager in a company , sp@@ ends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company .
mr. gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field . of course , the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well .
as some h@@ our@@ ly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent , they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs . some 14 % of h@@ our@@ ly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years .
" at first i did n't want to be an h@@ our@@ ly worker . yet after working for a few months , i feel it is better than working from 9 to 5@@ . "
xiao huang , whose job after college was not satis@@ fying , eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the pi@@ an@@ o .
" i am quite satisfied with my current job . it pays 100 yuan per hour and has a n@@ ice environment too . what i need to do now is find a few more h@@ our@@ ly positions . "
it was learned that working at h@@ our@@ ly positions has become an important approach for some job - seeking graduates to accumul@@ ate work experience , practice work skills , enhance communication skills , and increase exposure to society .
h@@ our@@ ly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge - based and more techn@@ ically focused positions . for instance , speci@@ alty focused jobs like those related to transl@@ ation and tr@@ end@@ y entertainment account for 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % , respectively .
some h@@ our@@ ly jobs require few skills , such as food sal@@ es@@ people and invent@@ ory workers . laid - off workers can start work right after minim@@ al training .
statistics show that among h@@ our@@ ly workers , 39 % were previously laid - off workers . among them , the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 6@@ 8.@@ 4 % , while the percentage in the cat@@ ering sector has reached 5@@ 8.@@ 7 % . h@@ our@@ ly jobs have become a major channel for the jo@@ bl@@ ess to get re@@ employed .

chinese experts : us playing up " china military threat " is ground@@ less accus@@ ation
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 9 ( correspon@@ dents li xu@@ an@@ liang , xiong zheng@@ yan , and lin li@@ ping ) in the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review that the us pentagon has officially submitted to congress recently , china was for the first time called " an emerging power that has the greatest potential to milit@@ arily challenge the united states . "
experts think this is a ground@@ less accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction . it plays up " china military threat " and inter@@ fer@@ es in china 's internal affairs .
the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review is the pentagon 's new national defense guideline document .
the 92 - page - long report devoted three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to commenting on china 's military issues and the countermeasures the united states should take . directly m@@ enti@@ oning the two phr@@ ases of " china " or " chinese " 15 times , the report said that " as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential to compete milit@@ arily with the united states . if the united states does not have countermeasures , china will very likely develop disrup@@ tive military technologies so as to destroy us advantages in conventional weapons . "
yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the chinese military academy of sciences , said that though senior us officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is the first time the united states proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " china is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to milit@@ arily challenge the united states . "
" the report for the first time explicitly refers to russia , india and china as emerging strategic ri@@ vals ; in particular , more attention was given to the so - called ' china military threat , ' "
said major general peng guang@@ qian , a research fellow with the chinese military academy of sciences .
notic@@ e@@ ably , on the same day the qu@@ ad@@ ren@@ n@@ ial defense review was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to congress , with the national defense budget at 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 billion us dollars .
" if the additional budget for military operations in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars , an all time high , " peng guang@@ qian said . " that is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world . "
peng gu@@ an@@ qian thinks that the fabr@@ ication of " foreign threats " by the united states reflected the pentagon 's hab@@ it@@ ual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge us arms industry groups can fish for more profits .
experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on china 's national defense , said that china 's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 199@@ 0s , but the proportion it takes in the state national budget for the same period is on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , the proportion of china 's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the state budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .
in 2005 china 's expenditures for national defense was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion rmb , only about 1@@ /@@ 14 of that of the united states . its military expenditure per capita was about 1@@ /@@ 60 of that of the united states , and its military funding per soldier was about 1@@ /@@ 30 of that of a us soldier .
" the united states is equal to china in terms of territorial area , but there is such a big difference in military expenditures . it is self - evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . "
peng guang@@ qian said .
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should evalu@@ ate china 's military construction situation obj@@ ectively and that china 's peaceful development does n't necessarily mean that china and the united states will become military ant@@ ag@@ on@@ ists in the future .
china 's 2004 white paper on national defense says that china firmly adher@@ es to the path of peaceful development and adop@@ ts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature .
china has never threatened any country in the past and at present , and will never do so in the future .
so far china has not set up any military base in any other country , nor has china dispatched a single soldier to other countries . in contrast , the united states has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in asia alone .
zhu feng , a professor of the international relations institute of pe@@ king university , said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the china - us constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency , r@@ am al@@ lah , feb. 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency correspon@@ dents wang hao and huang min
after the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention .
what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process .
in the meantime , resistance by the us and israel will add to the un@@ certain@@ ty about the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet .
( sub@@ title ) who will become prime minister ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some out@@ sid@@ ers worried that dis@@ agreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern .
the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to dis@@ continue economic aid and tax trans@@ fers to palestine .
however , this did not hin@@ der hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise .
according to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to select independent jam@@ al al-@@ k@@ hu@@ d@@ air@@ i , board chairman of the islamic university in gaza , as new prime minister .
the move has yet to receive respon@@ ses from relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nom@@ ine@@ e should try to down@@ play the hard - line stance of hamas . only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured .
( sub@@ title ) how to div@@ ide power ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
an article carried in the palestinian newspaper al-@@ ay@@ yam analyzed that although hamas won popul@@ arity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . it would be wise for it to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governance .
following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fat@@ ah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not responded enthusiastically so far .
fat@@ ah is currently divided inter@@ n@@ ally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rej@@ ects the hamas invitation , prefer@@ ring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council .
sources noted that under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah is gradually le@@ an@@ ing toward joining the new government .
in spite of this , hamas and fat@@ ah will still barg@@ ain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from par@@ tis@@ an aff@@ ili@@ ations .
according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclu@@ sively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown .
based on us and israeli at@@ titu@@ des , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to reli@@ eve outside pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assum@@ es power on the 16@@ th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
( sub@@ title ) what about arms ?
the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government .
the us and israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ecting its armed participation in the government .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al stressed on the 9@@ th that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization .
the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legi@@ tim@@ acy of arms and the aff@@ iliation and administration of armed forces .
hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the legislative council through democratic and free methods . the way to similarly leg@@ alize its subordinate armed faction az a - d@@ in al-@@ q@@ ass@@ am brig@@ ades is to integrate it into government security institutions .
hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " people 's army " of the palestinian national authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( ji@@ had ) .
at present , palestine has more than 6@@ 0,000 security agency personnel , most of whom come from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah has some lo@@ os@@ ely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades and the fat@@ ah haw@@ ks .
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with ab@@ b@@ as as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reason@@ ably div@@ ide administrative power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the various parties are still negoti@@ ating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far .
china releases report on polar exploration for first time
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 10 ( correspon@@ dent li jian@@ min ) the state oce@@ an@@ ic administration has recently released the 2005 annual report on china 's polar exploration . this is the first time such reports have ever been released since china began its scientific polar expedi@@ tion activities more than 20 years ago .
the report gives a comprehensive account of china 's polar exploration activities , polar logistics assurance , and major progres@@ ses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005 .
according to the records of the report , at 22@@ :@@ 15 on january 9 , 2005 ( beijing time ) , the chinese ant@@ arc@@ tic inland ic@@ ec@@ ap expedi@@ tion team successfully reached d@@ ome a area , the highest elev@@ ation of the ant@@ arc@@ tic inland ic@@ ec@@ ap , and at 3@@ :@@ 15 on january . 18 , 2005 ( beijing time ) confirmed the highest elev@@ ation point of d@@ ome a was 4,@@ 0@@ 9@@ 3 meters .
" on the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedi@@ tion , the chinese , relying on their strong will@@ power and fe@@ ar@@ less spirit , were cour@@ ageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the ' peak of the ant@@ arc@@ tic ic@@ ec@@ ap . ' their single - stro@@ ke success realized another dream of human be@@ ings in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a . "
so@@ a director sun zhi@@ hui said .
the report shows that on march 24 , 2005 , china 's 21st ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion team successfully finished its mission and returned to shanghai . the expedi@@ tion lasted 15@@ 1 days on a journey of 26@@ ,@@ 500 n@@ au@@ tical miles .
on november 18 of the same year , china 's 22@@ nd ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion team left shanghai for the zhong@@ shan station in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a to carry out scientific exploration , and it will leave the zhong@@ shan station for shanghai by way of australia before the end of february 2006 .
since it was the first report on polar exploration china released , the 2005 annual report on china 's polar exploration also reviewed and summar@@ ized china 's polar exploration that started in the early 198@@ 0s .
according to the report , in 198@@ 3 , china officially joined the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty and became a member country of the organization . in addition , china successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on ant@@ arc@@ tic affairs , including the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty consultative meeting , the scientific committee on ant@@ arc@@ tic research , and the council of managers of national ant@@ arc@@ tic programs .
in 1997 , china became a member of the international arc@@ tic science committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs .
the report noted that after more than 20 years , china 's polar exploration " has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale , " forming a " three stations , one vessel " system on ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and arc@@ tic exploration , namely , the chang@@ cheng station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic established in february 198@@ 5 and the zhong@@ shan station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic established in february 1989 , and the huang@@ he station built in july 2004 in the arc@@ tic , as well as the " xu@@ el@@ ong " polar scientific research vessel that was put into operation for ant@@ arc@@ tic and arc@@ tic exploration since 1994 .
the statistics in the report show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tions , two arc@@ tic expedi@@ tions based on the " xu@@ el@@ ong " vessel , and another two arc@@ tic expedi@@ tions at the huang@@ he station . to date , more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by chinese people nationwide to the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and arc@@ tic for up close and on - site exploration .
" we are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a scientific station and also china 's first inland station at the ant@@ arc@@ tic . "
sun zhi@@ hui said .
" after more than 20 years ' endeav@@ ors , china has got a ni@@ che in polar exploration in the world . however , compared with other major polar exploration countries , there is still a relatively large gap . we must catch up with them . "
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui disclosed that china will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year .

xinhua news agency , tokyo , feb. 13 ( correspon@@ dent qian zheng ) researchers at japan 's to@@ kai university have developed a type of bi@@ o - arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney , which not only has the same cat@@ abol@@ ic functions as a human kid@@ ney , but also the function of preserving useful sub@@ stances . in addition it is small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kid@@ ney patients .
according to a recent ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i business daily report , the newly - developed bi@@ o - arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney mainly consists of two parts , an arti@@ ficial ne@@ phr@@ on that fil@@ ters met@@ abol@@ ic waste and water from the blood and an arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ le that returns to the blood the useful ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents in primary ur@@ ine , such as water and am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds .
both the " arti@@ ficial ne@@ phr@@ on " and the " arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ le " are made of h@@ oll@@ ow fi@@ bers . in addition , the interior of the arti@@ ficial ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ le is fully lined with ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial cell@@ s which have the ability to dec@@ om@@ pose met@@ abol@@ ic waste .
the ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial cell@@ s can dec@@ om@@ pose the caus@@ ative substance of di@@ aly@@ sis - related am@@ y@@ lo@@ id@@ os@@ is , a disease caused by repeated h@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , into am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds and return them to the blood while re@@ absor@@ bing into the blood the gl@@ uc@@ ose , vit@@ am@@ ins , and min@@ er@@ als the body needs .
in contrast , previous arti@@ ficial kid@@ ne@@ ys , depending on the difference of os@@ mo@@ tic pres@@ sures to fil@@ ter met@@ abol@@ ic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents such as am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds to the blood .
researchers tested the bi@@ o - arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney trans@@ plant on go@@ ats , using a pi@@ g 's ep@@ i@@ th@@ el@@ ial cell@@ s to line the interior of the h@@ oll@@ ow fi@@ bers of the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney had been able to function .
they are presently developing a bi@@ o - arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney using human ren@@ al cell@@ s and will start clin@@ ical studies after testing its safety .
safe power production in china still faces serious challenges
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 13 ( correspon@@ dent an bei ) a senior official from the state electricity regulatory commission said on the 13@@ th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005 , safe power production still faces serious challenges .
at the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the national commission for safe power production held here , ser@@ c vice chairman shi yu@@ bo said that in 2005 china 's power production safety was generally stable , while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and saf@@ ely accomplished . active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters , and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured . accidents involving power production safety infrastructure as well as general power gr@@ id accidents were significantly reduced on a year - on - year basis , and the physical condition of power supply infrastructure was improved .
nevertheless , he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly - built power gener@@ ator units added in succession , safe power production will face new challenges .
included in these challenges are : regional , seas@@ onal , and peri@@ od@@ ic power short@@ ages will continue to exist ; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight ; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pric@@ ing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems , while at the same time , the lack of effective control over the dec@@ lining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power gener@@ ator units ; some weak@@ ly struc@@ tured parts of power gr@@ i@@ ds and out@@ dated equipment may pose hidden haz@@ ards to the safety of the system ; and the frequency of accidents in power infrastructure construction has yet to be brought under control , with the situation remaining grim .
shi yu@@ bo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform , many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge . how to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems .
with regard to power production safety work in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety ; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emer@@ gen@@ cies ; enhance capabilities for handling emer@@ gen@@ cies ; step up coordination and cooperation among power produc@@ ers and power gr@@ i@@ ds so as to jointly maintain power system safety ; continue to effectively supervise dam safety for hydr@@ o - electric power stations and to work on developing information networks to ensure dam safety ; strengthen safety supervision in power infrastructure construction to reduce accidents resulting in casualties ; and continue to enhance information reporting and noti@@ fication to ensure the accurate and timely flow of power safety information .
it was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation , this year the ser@@ c will carry out revision and improvement of the provisional regulations on investigation of power production accidents that were issued . meanwhile , supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydr@@ o - electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year .
in 2005 , electricity consumption by all sectors in china reached 2,@@ 4@@ 6@@ 8.@@ 9 g@@ ig@@ aw@@ at@@ t - hours , up 13.@@ 45 % year - on - year .
faced with adverse situations such as tigh@@ tening power supply and demand , and increasing problems with coal , electricity , and oil transportation , various power produc@@ ers took effective measures , stepping up management of infrastructure . in all of last year , throughout the country , no excep@@ tionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production .
there were 74 gr@@ id accidents , down 1@@ 27 cases year - on - year , and 4@@ 27 infrastructure accidents , down 13@@ 2 cases year - on - year .
south african minister plen@@ i@@ poten@@ tiary in china says no " organized " crimes against chinese citizens in south africa
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 13 ( correspon@@ dents wang jiang@@ ang and hao y@@ al@@ in ) minister plen@@ i@@ poten@@ tiary v@@ u@@ si b. k@@ ol@@ o@@ ane , charge d@@ '@@ aff@@ ai@@ res ad interim of the south african embassy in china , said in an exclusive xinhua interview on the 13@@ th that there are no " organized " crimes against chinese citizens in south africa .
at the same time , he said that the south african government will try its best to " crack down on all forms of criminal activity . "
v@@ u@@ si b. k@@ ol@@ o@@ ane said that the south african government hopes to " reduce to zero " the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in south africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in south africa . chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this .
in response to this , the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and also reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further step up vigilance , enhance unity and friendship among chinese compatriots , and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities .
" we express our sincer@@ est sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims . "
v@@ u@@ si b. k@@ ol@@ o@@ ane said : " we apolog@@ ize for this and ass@@ ure the chinese people that the south african government is earnestly investigating every single case involving chinese nationals . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the february 5 case in which chen jian@@ qing , a chinese woman from fujian , china , was killed in south africa . a suspect has been arrested .
at present police are after another suspect .
also , according to the dis@@ closure by the south african embassy in china , the criminal involved in the shooting of a hong kong business@@ man in january of this year has been arrested by south african police , with the property of the victim recovered .
speaking of the impact that these incidents of chinese citizens being killed may have , v@@ u@@ si b. k@@ ol@@ o@@ ane thinks that the incidents " indeed " will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade , tourism , and other fields between the two countries , but the impact " should be fairly small " in the long run .
according to the briefing by n@@ y@@ embe@@ zi , tourism atta@@ che of the south african embassy , the embassy issued more than 2,000 vis@@ as to chinese nationals going to south africa in the first 15 days alone of this year .
in addition , according to the chinese official statistics , south africa continued to maintain its position as china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached 7.@@ 27 billion us dollars , growing 23 % year - on - year .
however , tourism professionals think that the ser@@ ial k@@ ill@@ ings of chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to the statistics of south africa 's tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a 14.@@ 9 % year - on - year decrease .
currently , some 200,000 chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across south africa .
analysts here attribu@@ te the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor , high unemployment rate , rampant use of guns , and lack of death penalty in south africa .
as many chinese nationals do not understand english and have cash with them or in their homes , they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money .

state administration of work safety : prevention of frequent serious and large - scale co@@ al@@ mine and other accidents is top priority this year
xinhua news agency , beijing , feb. 17 ( correspon@@ dent liu zheng ) with a series of four co@@ al@@ mine accidents each killing more than 100 people , the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made " prevention of frequent ser@@ ous and large - scale co@@ al@@ mine and other accidents " the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year .

( winter olympics - stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a case likely to end where it is
xinhua news agency , tur@@ in , feb. 17 news analysis : p@@ y@@ lev@@ a case likely to end where it is
xinhua correspon@@ dents gao peng and ding ying
although italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimul@@ ants during the tur@@ in winter olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to russian bi@@ athle@@ te ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a , the center of the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al at this winter olympics .
on the 16@@ th , the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al broke out at the tur@@ in winter olympics when ol@@ g@@ a p@@ y@@ lev@@ a was found to have used car@@ p@@ he@@ don , a banned drug .
the next day the international olympic committee announced that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a had been exp@@ elled from the winter olympics . in addition , she was stri@@ pped of the individual bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on silver med@@ al for women 's 15 km event she won at this winter olympics .
on the same day , the international bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on union decided to give p@@ y@@ lev@@ a a two - year ban from the competition .
it has always been the i@@ oc regulation that athletes found using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games be subject to rev@@ ocation of their achievements and the elig@@ ibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , under italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimul@@ ants are considered criminal acts . prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimul@@ ants , and viol@@ ators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years .
in december last year , after " barg@@ aining " for a year , the i@@ oc and the italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimul@@ ants at this winter olympics in accordance with the italian law .
through the unti@@ ring efforts of the i@@ oc , the italian side made concession four days before the winter olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the winter olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of italian prosecu@@ tors .
some reports said that p@@ es@@ can@@ te , an italian government official supervising the tur@@ in winter olympics , has already turned over the case of p@@ y@@ lev@@ a using stimul@@ ant to tur@@ in 's prosecu@@ tors .
however , the i@@ oc and p@@ es@@ can@@ te himself so far have not confirmed it yet .
russian bi@@ ath@@ l@@ on team doctor and@@ re@@ y d@@ my@@ tr@@ iev disclosed at noon on the 17@@ th that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a has already left tur@@ in for her country .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official who form@@ erly worked at the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , thinks that once p@@ y@@ lev@@ a returns to her country , this incident may eventually " end where it is . "
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimul@@ ant issue at the winter olympics . even if the italian prosecution agency really ge@@ ts involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell .
based on italy 's pen@@ alties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimul@@ ant abuse , the maximum pen@@ alties viol@@ ators got were only " two - year de@@ ferred imprisonment . "
therefore , pi@@ ail@@ i , a senior reporter from the italian news agency ans@@ a , said that there is " little " chance that p@@ y@@ lev@@ a will go to j@@ ail . she would just face fines at maximum .
pi@@ ail@@ i also said that although the italian court can hold a trial in abs@@ enti@@ a , the italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch p@@ y@@ lev@@ a and bring her back for serving the sentence .
if p@@ y@@ lev@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the judgment , the italian side will not be able to do anything to her .
