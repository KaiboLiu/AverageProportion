the
the chinese academy of military sciences [ cas@@ s ] research fellow peng guang@@ qian said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " the " defense review report " was formally submitted on the same day , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the government budget for 2007 , of which the defense budget was $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the reason for the war in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said : the us gu@@ y fabr@@ icated the theory of other countries ' threat reflected the pentagon 's intention to create an enemy .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times in the military review of the national defense white paper written by chinese defense experts deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , along with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditure in the same period has been dec@@ lining .
official statistics show that in 2004 , china 's total exports of goods grew by 2@@ 4.@@ 8 percent over the same period last year .
in 2005 , china 's national defense expenditure was $ 24@@ 4.@@ 56 billion , a rise of only a considerable portion of the us national defense budget , and the per capita military spending of the us is only about $ 1 / 60 . military spending is only about $ 2@@ 60 .

the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china international convention on national defense " said that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china used to and now did not have any such thing in the past , nor did it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any international economic and trade center in any other country , nor has it sent military personnel to other countries .
professor zhang xu@@ e@@ zhong of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively advance the cause of sino - us constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas 's cabinet is seeking to break through the barri@@ er
xinhua news agency , beijing , sept . 28 ,
palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won legislative seats in the legislative council , how to out@@ law the new term of government .
hamas to implement what kind of new policy will directly affect the peace process the parties concerned will take corresponding measures in the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added a vari@@ able to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] has made great contributions to the development of the country 's economy .
hamas has won the right to form a cabinet , and some people in the world have worried that hamas prime minister mi@@ k@@ ha@@ il mu@@ ham@@ mad would have a dispute with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the us - led coalition government , which is currently visiting egypt , has stressed that hamas will be formed under hamas 's leadership , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal will also aggrav@@ ate the international situation .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the real power , and threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and to transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this is not ham@@ per@@ ing hamas 's efforts to make flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not easy for the independent to elect an independent person .
it is reported that in order to get the international recognition as much as possible , recently the hamas leader at home and abroad in egypt has decided to select an independent candidate , k@@ ay@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of j@@ a@@ af@@ ar@@ i , to take up the new prime minister .
this move has not been approved by relevant departments .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian government has been taking a positive attitude toward the palestinian people 's political rights and interests , no matter who the prime minister 's post is , and the most crucial thing is to try to less@@ en hamas 's strong color . only by so doing can it ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] has made great efforts to implement the principle of " one country , two systems " and to implement the principle of " one country , two systems " in the light of the actual situation in the country .
in terms of internal affairs , hamas 's cabinet is faced with the greatest challenge , namely , the lack of sufficient governing experience .
the " y@@ on@@ ha@@ p " carried an analysis of the article , saying that hamas has concentrated its efforts in social welfare projects , but in the aspect of governance it lacks experience and is in line with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has the experience of governing .
hamas has been in a state of emergency after the election , and has proposed building relations with the k@@ it@@ ty haw@@ k , and jointly establishing a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah 's internal situation is not yet in the cabinet .
the news brief@@ ly pointed out that under the leadership of ab@@ b@@ as , the fat@@ ah gradually became more and more active in joining the new government .
even so , hamas has been in a state of hostility with fat@@ ah .
in addition , the other way is to establish a framework of the legislative committee , which is divor@@ ced from the cabinet of the parties .
it is reported that hamas also designed a clear - cut plan for the use of force against hamas , but the specific list was not known .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have adopted a policy of technical experts , the technical experts have also failed to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the new round of the palestinian legislative council 's inauguration on 16 april nom@@ inated the prime minister and set up the cabinet will be held in three weeks to five weeks .
the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] has always been the first to fight against the enemy .
hamas 's weapons are the most powerful weapon to establish a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect the political participation .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir said on 9 july that armed resistance is the core of the strategy of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the bel@@ ong@@ ing of the armed forces .
hamas 's political and economic reforms have been carried out in the form of democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to bring all the armed forces into the palestinian national authority .
the palestinian people now have 6@@ 0,000 security personnel .
moreover , fat@@ ah 's political leaders have some organizational relations .
the three - party coalition government , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold consultations with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate security control powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense organs , and other organizations , and the new government 's internal affairs department is under the charge of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no substantive progress has been made .

according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , chinese tourists to south africa were 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent .
at present , the people of chinese origin living in south africa are about 200,000 , and the cities and villages in south africa are all sc@@ attered .
analysts here believe that south africa 's social wealth gap is huge and the unemployment rate is high , guns are spreading , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death . therefore , the crime rate is high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have a common sense of cash on their bodies and their homes , and they are more pr@@ one to criminal elements who seek financial att@@ ackers .
