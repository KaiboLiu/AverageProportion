china 's top investment firm , liu le@@ fei , believes that the rmb re@@ valuation and the domestic capital market are good , and insurance companies will not be able to invest in foreign exchange in a large scale in the near future . this also means that the insurance cover will not diver@@ t domestic stock funds in the short term .
the report said that many insurance companies hold the same view .
experts said that since there is still no market for renminbi , insurance organs are not in a sufficient number of risk - avo@@ id@@ ance measures , so the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchases is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : for a long period of time , in the aspect of the asset allocation , foreign investment should occupy a certain proportion of the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , given that the rmb is under a relatively high pressure of appreciation , china 's r@@ ing@@ leaders will mainly use their own foreign exchange funds to invest outside china .
for foreign investment in purchasing foreign exchange , we should be cautious in the current situation .

germany plans to reduce the thre@@ sh@@ old of professional talent
ber@@ lin , july 1 , 2007 ( wen wei po )
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ av@@ ar@@ do s@@ ach@@ a said the other day that germany should lower the " spr@@ ing@@ board " to impose restrictions on foreign professional personnel , and through increasing the import of foreign talents , it should resolve the issue of german professionals .
the report said that germany 's exports to germany , aged between 15 and 64 , will drop year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation to the year 20@@ 20 , germany 's labor force will be reduced by 6 % compared with the current .
but the german employer 's association and the german engine@@ er association reported that the german labor market is currently operating in germany , and the engine@@ er and engine@@ er are quite capable of producing a large amount of talent .
according to the statistics of the federal labor bureau of germany , the supply of engine@@ ers in germany 's labor market totaled about 27@@ 0,000 , and the supply of technicians was about 9@@ 60 .
germany 's foreign investment in order to protect its own people and set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting foreign talent .
germany 's " th@@ ro@@ at law " stipulates that non - eu countries are not qualified to produce less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be granted the permission of work in germany and residence .

do not have super@@ sti@@ tion in legal theory
the " law on lawyers " which was submitted to the npc standing committee for examination recently stipulates that the law has been engaged in legal research and teaching , and it has the capability of high - level , equal , and professional personnel , and the number of lawyers who have applied for the law has been examined and approved by the judicial administration department of the state council .
( " zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao " on 28 june )
in the legal sense , there are theoretical circles and real estate , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work .
for a long time , the legal community has a legal knowledge circle , a solid business , a phenomenon of p@@ our@@ ing the man , a phenomenon of l@@ uc@@ ky appearance , a theoretical circle , believes that the real estate is not necessary for the business community , but is only a form@@ idable part of the rob@@ ot paper , and the real - estate sector is a critical element of the theoretical system of the tu@@ be used in the theoretical guidance of the theory .
the legal system can be used to differ@@ enti@@ ate between different categories , and the law should be maintained , not to support any one party .
however , the name of the " law of lawyers " is composed of the name of the law , but obj@@ ectively it is approved by the law , the legal profession must be higher than the legal profession 's judgment .
in fact , some people who are engaged in research on the law and the international p@@ ure theory , such as those engaged in research and teaching , are deeply related to legal practice , and are actually linked to legal affairs .
in this way , the pat@@ ents of the ro@@ tary company will undoubtedly be legal , legal , practical , and poor , and will have an extremely bad name .
the super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circle is not only these , but also the experts ' proof that they will often affect or even ve@@ to the court verdic@@ t , and this is also a direct expression of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

british government to raise the level of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the level of serious damage , which said british terrorist attacks would not be launched soon , but the attacks would still be extremely likely .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the investigation to india and australia .
the eight suspects arrested were all in medical system .
it is reported that nearly 400 people working in the british public medical system were receiving medical treatment overseas and are qualified to receive medical treatment overseas .

do n't let the traders get imp@@ ati@@ ent
the p@@ air of tourists is a p@@ ure , clean , and self - reli@@ ant , and to the greatest extent it enjoys the fruits of natural and social civilization .
but many people have been hit by this kind of troubles in the country . they are being attacked by the business@@ man and business intermedi@@ ary businesses .
whether it is the car or the tr@@ ains , the upper car , and the v@@ an , it will suffer the death of the small business@@ man and some non - card intermedi@@ ary .
it is not selling c@@ akes , that is , selling newspapers and journ@@ als , and that is , many intermedi@@ ary newspapers without lic@@ enses , such as food , be@@ ver@@ age , and fake pro@@ of@@ s .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is much un@@ successful that you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some areas , many of them have the same feelings .
in the future , some people came to the gate of the city to make a show and make a living .
after entering the gate , this situation will be even more serious . in addition , y@@ a@@ xing , who is well - known , has been blin@@ ded by a few words .
some media reports have reported that many foreign tourists who have gone to xian are not unique to the mon@@ ument in xian , but they have not been able to provide the small business haw@@ kers with more than re@@ fined money .
these include the station 's v@@ enti@@ l@@ ation , the p@@ y@@ ram@@ id , the place where it is going to be built and the place where it is called , the civilization is orderly , stable , and harmonious , and the environment of car@@ ing for the public .
the free market of the traders and the confu@@ sion of the business operators has not been said : obj@@ ectively , these public order has been destroyed , and the environment has been pollu@@ ted . at the same time , it also provides a platform for the preparation and opportunity of the project .
what is important is that these are the wind@@ ows for local spiritual civilization construction , and the p@@ ag@@ od@@ a is seen in the whole ba@@ g , and the damage is not only an issue of image but also will have an impact on local economic development .
think about , you want to become a strong tourism industry , but you use this kind of chao@@ tic and un@@ stable tourist environment to welcome the guests from the south to the north . who is willing to come , who will dare come ?
how do you have economic returns on your tourism ?
with the arrival of the peak season , the number of tourists in the north of the ti@@ ant@@ an prefecture has created a civilized tourism environment , which should be said to be a pressing task at present .
the ha@@ ul is not a market , and the business behavior of small business haw@@ kers should be regul@@ ated , and those that do not have a license should be resolutely canc@@ elled . illegal activities should be resolutely dealt bl@@ ows .
only in a civilized and orderly environment can we make our city happy and return to the motherland , and hu@@ ax@@ ia .
in a word , do n't let the business operators get imp@@ ati@@ ent .
the award of the company 's own initiative is not enough .
the construction of dong@@ cheng district in beijing , the issuance of electric sh@@ ells and other items , as a measure to reward 12 low - income families who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ side .
( " xin@@ jing bao " 10 july )
this writ@@ er is happy for the improvement of the family life , but he is very happy to see the draft of pro@@ actively with@@ drawing from the barr@@ acks , and also to give the money to the public , but he is in a complicated m@@ ood .
deputy director of the ji@@ angu@@ ang neighbor@@ hood office said : in view of the problem of che@@ ating and minim@@ izing assurance , we should encourage active re@@ payment of the public housing fund , which is an example for other low - income households .
if this is an example of encouraging other low - income insurance workers to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this to appeal to those who have long been pl@@ agu@@ ed by low - income people , it will not be possible to be somewhat f@@ led@@ gl@@ ed .
in the areas of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clean@@ ing up of low - income households , more depend@@ ed on laws .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of low - income households in their duty to enjoy minimum allow@@ ance : if they promptly report on the changes in family members and income , report on employment conditions , and accept regular re@@ views , the departments concerned should increase the intensity of supervision and inspection .
after all , the pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary of the company is a long - term plan .
the street was re@@ war@@ ded to the family and the family was bur@@ ied by anyone .
as a government organization at the first level , its expenditures are borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
and the money of the tax@@ pay@@ er should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal of a low - income family prov@@ es that it has already possess@@ ed a certain capacity of self - suffici@@ ency , and on the other hand , is there any such person who appl@@ ies for low - income insurance still exist ?
the government financial assistance , which is called the life - saving money , should be delivered in s@@ now@@ y weather rather than in the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu da@@ yi is willing to be a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first town to be directly elected in the country 's new town of l@@ ul@@ an township in the new capital of ji@@ u@@ quan district , was granted democratic approval for the fourth time since taking office , with the rate of satisfaction reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the talks between the reporter and liu con@@ go , liu dao@@ yi posi@@ tioned himself as a sing@@ er .
( yesterday 's " xin@@ jing bao " )
liu 's c@@ att@@ le and the service of the company may be more than the amount of money for the personnel appointed to be provided by some cadres , and even more true , the people will be able to make them feel more .
the public - to - public election system is the most important thing in the system , and the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses , and the latter is mainly appointed by the higher authorities , and the orientation of power is determined that the former must be responsible to the public .
the source of power and responsibility for whom are the key to determining how the candidate will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such a democratic style is even more like a democratic show .
my viewpoint is that there is such a democratic style of pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary , which is better than not .
considering the historical and political building of china 's grassroots democracy , i think that the open election is a major event for the people to choose , and democracy is a matter of vital importance . this is of great significance to promoting the building of grassroots democratic politics .

the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting that di@@ a@@ bet@@ es should be treated with good faith because scientists have been informed of the new york journal published on 21 may that the new drug problem is a serious problem .
therefore , the doctor and the patient were closely concerned about the issue .
the statistics show that about one month after the issuance of safety warnings , the us pharmaceutical administration received 3@@ 57 examples of the outbreak of bad reaction .
in january and february this year , the drug administration received only 50 and 73 complaints against non - performing loans .
these bad re@@ actions are light to the water bu@@ b@@ bles , and will emphasize the death of heart disease .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that the conclusion of the un@@ safe conclusion of v@@ in@@ cent di@@ eg@@ o is still too early .
the drug administration will hold a seminar on the to@@ days of v@@ in@@ cent on july 30 .
in 1999 , v@@ in@@ cent di@@ e@@ jan@@ a was a mag@@ ic increase in pan@@ e , which was applicable to c@@ ure m@@ am@@ in@@ at@@ a@@ ur@@ s .
there are about 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients in the world who have taken or are taking di@@ a@@ bet@@ es .
the british giant gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an has always considered that the company is a safe and safe person , and it is also a good thing for the patient .

the three major functions of modern military uni@@ forms
the first is to identify functions .
it is necessary to distingu@@ ish between the armed forces of different countries and the armed forces of different arms and services and the masses .
in the world 's big and small countries , although the military uni@@ forms are basically the same , the military does not have two countries ' armed forces .
second , symbol@@ izing functions .
to a certain extent , military uni@@ forms are both spiritual appearance and national characteristics of a country and are also a reflection of the combat capability of a country 's military .
in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the three military uni@@ forms were used as training uni@@ forms , which could best demonstrate the military spirit of the army , including the be@@ au@@ ty of the car@@ to@@ on .
third , the defense function .
with the rapid development of new and high - tech weaponry , the comprehensive defense capability of new - type operational training uni@@ forms has enabled the military uni@@ form to have anti - chemical det@@ ection , chemical defense , b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ium defense , and the temperature transfer and wh@@ ip transfer .

the party committee organs of a certain group army have the courage to deal with the issue .

in the past few years , with the personnel of this unit , some of the houses of this group were occupied by un@@ authorized rules , causing the housing difficulties of the working cadres and the officers and men to have a rather big opinion on this .
the group also had a clear idea of several housing buildings , which could not be settled because of various obstruc@@ tions , making this problem a problem of old people .
as long as we dare to fight real battles , we will not resolve difficult problems that cannot be solved .
the new party committee group reached a consensus , and the principal leaders personally made preparations for the disposal of all un@@ authorized housing problems .
on the one hand , they were moving , and were willing to make a speech , hoping that the relevant personnel would talk about the use of the m@@ ai@@ ze house in the army , the finance park , and the housing department , and this shows the party committee 's firm determination and principled stand .
for some housing units that are not willing to withdraw from houses that are occupied by the public , the party committee organs promptly made arrangements with their units and adopted corresponding measures to ensure that their own units are coordinated with the military .
after two months of painstaking work , all those who have violated the rules and regulations will be moved out on schedule . the officers working in the bat@@ tal@@ ion will be assigned to housing according to regulations .
the party committee of the unit d@@ ared to fight tough battles than the real ones , and also produced a pi@@ thy effect . the original cadres who were unwilling to cooperate actively in organizational distribution have also expressed their acceptance of the decision by the organization .

the jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform improv@@ es the quality of military cadres
the report says that cao ji@@ ag@@ ong is a p@@ ure report : on 18 june , a special military cadre of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , gathered together to gather together the cadres of the armed forces department of x@@ ig@@ xian town , lu yu@@ qing , on " winning the psychological war under the condition of informationization . " the guidance class was unanimously con@@ ferred by the students in the psychological training .
this is a new achievement made by the ministry of public security in light of the actual work post , and it is necessary to devote efforts to improving the overall quality of the cadres with special arms .
at the beginning of this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during the investigation and study of the grass - roots units that some cadres with special arms were working for posts , positions , and positions , and did not concentrate their main energ@@ ies on doing armed work .
therefore , they have adopted a method of concentrated training to train personnel and to rely on training at local party schools to conduct regular training of specialized military cadres and to focus on resolving the problem of having a single knowledge - oriented professional knowledge on the part of military cadres .
in connection with the central task , we should give special military cadres with weapons to work boldly , and through their posts , we should improve their ability to work .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for hir@@ ing cadres with special arms " and explicitly stipulated that the armed forces minister must be in the leading body of the party committee in the name of the party committee and that he will not be engaged in other duties ;
and established a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special arms , and made a decision on some cadres who are not suited to the armed forces at the grassroots level in a timely manner , adjusting and exchanging their ideas , and making good use of comrades who have a strong ability to work in a comprehensive manner .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the new century department of the armed forces company ltd. , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to develop under@@ water vessels , thus turning the internal ac@@ re@@ age into the company 's armed forces department .
good will still be good at the beginning
from the result of the competition , the two - to - two score was reasonable , and also could be accepted by the p@@ ap@@ er@@ work . the key is the competition process , and the number of people are regre@@ tt@@ able .
if the iranian team is 2 to 0 , then the final will be set to equ@@ alize , then the feeling of being a p@@ air of chinese will certainly be very strong , and the situation is complicated .
the good will cannot be ended , but it can be said that it is a problem .
the situation is often un@@ stable under the condition of the situation . the views of ordinary people are china 's psychological quality not perfect .
this is indeed a kind of thing that can not be done in the end .
however , judging from the competition today , it seems that it is not as good as it is .
sun ji@@ ap@@ ai , sun ji@@ angu@@ ang , sh@@ ao@@ ji@@ u@@ yi , and others k@@ ic@@ ked in europe , and did not say that li wei and others were also the old s@@ and@@ y of the jing@@ sha court . they saw many things as they had seen and said that their mental quality would not be anything .
this p@@ ity was forced by the iranian team , and the reason was probably the temporary move to hand over the troops to iraq .
the iranian team has been replaced by two in a backward situation , and the scene has been immediately destroyed .
the second half of the game also changed three sh@@ ots , but the results were not good .
to overcome the problem of being good and not being able to end well , we must find the root cause of the problem .
so long as the problem is accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find a way to change the problem .
fear that they will be afraid of a sudden illness to seek medical treatment .
if this is done , the pi@@ g will be able to play more games , and the old will still be guilty , and it is not possible to talk about the k@@ ick that everyone is looking forward to .
