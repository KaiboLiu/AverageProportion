prc expert says us ' unreasonable ' to ' china 's military threat '
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to provide a new security guarantee for the us military to meet the needs of the us military , the pentagon said here today
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accusation and a panic about china 's normal national defense construction , playing up the chinese military threat theory , and interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three paragraphs to expound the chinese military power and the us response , with a total of 15 directly mentioned china 's ' imperial ' or ' chinese ' ' words , ' and said that as a ' major ' and ' regional ' , the united states has the most important and most important role to compete with the united states .
yao yunzhu , research fellow of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar viewpoints many times before , this was the first time that the united states put forward in the strategic report on national defense strategy that china is the newly emerging big power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the ' report ' explicitly defines russia 's role as a newly emerging strategic opponent , especially the so - called ' china threat theory , ' as a newly emerging strategic opponent , and gives more attention to the so - called china military threat theory .
major general peng guangqian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted to the congress the draft government budget for fiscal year 2007 , which includes the defense budget for the fiscal year of $ 439.3 - billion .
if the united states and iraq add military action to iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for the fiscal year 2007 will exceed 5,000 billion us dollars .
peng guangqian held that the us trick of speculating on the threat of other countries reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of creating enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide a powerful weapon industry for the united states ' huge arms industry .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
military experts deng hongzhou , who had participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper on many occasions , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures has dropped in the same period .
official statistics show that in 2004 and 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures accounted for nearly 10 percent of the national financial expenditures for the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 was 244.656 - billion yuan , only about one - tenth of the united states ' total national military spending , which is equivalent to about one - sixth of the united states ' per capita military spending , and the per capita military spending is about one - third of the us military spending .
the united states ' territory is roughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge , and who 's actually military strength exceeds the normal defense needs , and this is self - evident .
peng guangqian said :
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively evaluate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military opponents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and pursues a defensive national defense policy .

( international observation ) hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthroughs
ramallah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 22 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world at present .
what new policy will hamas pursue directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has added variables to the prospect of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultation and making a thorough and frank discussion on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming a cabinet that may affect the future development of the situation .
the prime minister 's position has flowed down to the family .
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people in the outside world worried that the hamas prime minister 's proposal might have a difference with the current top leader abbas .
in addition , hamas leader mohammad al-mashar , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggravated the international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that has real power , and have used this as a threat to halt the economic aid to palestine and to hand over tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not obstruct hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to elect an independent person .
according to reports , in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , who are gathering in egypt , decided to elect an independent candidate , jameari hodori , chairman of the board of directors of the gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts hossein said that no matter who the premier 's post will be , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try as much as possible to play down hamas 's hard - line guy , and only by so doing can the successful formation of a cabinet be achieved .
how to distribute power ( subhead )
the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
an analysis carried by the palestinian newspaper " sunshine " said that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and is closely linked with the ruling palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partnership with fatah , jointly forming a national coalition government , but fatah has not given a positive response to this .
within fatah , there are different opinions on whether to join the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government so that it can do something , while the other faction refuses to invite the invitation , and is willing to act as a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , with abbas 's advice , fatah gradually tends to join the new government .
even if this is the case , hamas and fatah will bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is that the framework of the legislative yuan is a cabinet that is not subordinate to the party .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean - up expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also not out of the question of forming a cabinet by reducing external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative council took office on 16 february , the work of nominating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where is the course of armed forces ?
the weapons in hamas 's hands are another thorny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the us and israel have taken a very tough stance , and have resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to take part in the government .
hamas leader ma shar stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the question of armed force actually includes the legality of weapons and the issue of the management of the armed forces at both levels .
hamas elected as first party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom has won international recognition , making it a major armed organization of the hamas , a member of the armed factions , and a legalized one , that is , to unify it with the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify armed forces of all factions into a " war of terror " for the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a wide response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jade ) .
palestine now has more than 60,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah also has some armed factions that are loose in organization relations , such as the imperial guard of the al-aqsa martyrs ' xisha , the fatah spirit , and so on .
hamas , who is in charge of forming a cabinet , must reach agreement with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own administration and rationally distribute security management powers .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , but the interior ministry of the new government will be under the control of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further article .

currently , we are working to establish the third antarctic research station , and it is also china 's first inland inspection station in the antarctic ocean to conduct feasibility studies and research work .
sun zhihui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration project has occupied a leading position in the world 's polar exploration , but it is still not the same as other major polar observation countries .
he said .
sun zhihui disclosed that china will publish annual report on polar observation in the future .

japanese researchers develop new highly effective human kidney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the east china sea university of japan has developed a biological human - to - human kidney - - making kidney - making function , which is not only the same as human kidney but also has the function of preserving the material ingredients , and is small in volume and easy to transplant . as the research deepens , it is hopeful that it will bring about fuels for kidney patients .
according to a report by the nixon industrial news a few days ago , the newly developed biomass - made kidneys are mainly composed of two parts , and the part is to filter tration of trucks from blood , trash , and water in blood . the other is to use a large quantity of blood , including the water divider and the kidney , which have returned to blood .
the petty cream and the thumbs built by the imperial body are made by the silicon wire of the central and the thin cave of the man , and the inside of the thin cave is filled with the dividing function of the substitute cells .
this skins cells can make many blood analysis of the diseases that have caused so much so that the disease can be considered as a variable due to the substratum of the material to be used as a magic acid and return to blood , while at the same time it can also enable the body to reenter the water , such as the glass needed for body , the solar , and the substances , etc.
in the past , the filtration of human - made kidneys by relying on penetration pressure cannot completely remove them and does not have the conditions to make amazic acid and other components return to blood .
researchers used the sheep to carry out experiments on biological human - made kidney transplantation , using pig - on - skin cells in the cement of the human - made kidney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human - made kidneys had been able to function .
at present , they are developing biohuman kidney for use of human kidney cells and will start clinical research after testing their safety .
china 's power industry faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power administration ( sasac ) said on wednesday that the country 's power industry has maintained a stable growth in the year 2005 despite the fact that the country 's power industry has maintained a stable production safety situation .
shi yubo , vice chairman of the national electricity safety supervision commission , said here at the fifth meeting of the national electricity safety commission ( enlarged ) that china 's power industry will have a stable and satisfactory completion of the summer mission of power generation to meet the peak of summer and to ensure safety and electricity supply , actively deal with the intrusion of natural disasters , and basically guarantee the safe and stable operation of the power system .
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the supply and demand situation of power supply and demand and the successive commissioning of a large number of new generating units , the safe production of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include the regional seasonal variation of power shortage , and the supply and demand situation in some regions remains tight , and the prices of coal have not yet formed due to the sound mechanism of coal prices , causing a relatively big problem in coal supply . meanwhile , the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and the impact on the stable operation of power generating units will be seriously affected , and some of the power grid , equipment , and the hidden safety of power
shi yubo said : as the reform of the power system deepens , many deep - seated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the workers ' ranks and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the work of safe production in 2006 , shi yuliu said that it is necessary to further consolidate the foundation work for safe production of electric power , speed up the establishment and improvement of contingency management mechanisms for power safety , enhance the capability of handling sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power plants and networks , and jointly safeguard the safety of power systems , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the construction of dams and informationization , and strengthen safety in power construction and
it has been learned that in light of the new situation in power safety management , the commission will conduct a special inspection of the " interim regulations on investigation of power accidents " promulgated this year . at the same time , relevant regulations on the safety of the dam of the hydropower station and the safety protection of the second system of the power plant will be issued this year .
in 2005 , china 's entire society used 246.89 - billion kilowatts of electricity , up 13.45 percent from the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of supply and demand for power , which is still tight , and the contradiction between coal , electricity , oil , and transport is conspicuous , all power enterprises have conscientiously adopted effective measures to strengthen equipment management , and last year , no major equipment accident occurred in the country 's power production .
the number of power grids has dropped by 127 , and the number of equipment accidents has dropped by 427 , a year - on - year decrease of 132 .
south african envoy to china said that there is no such thing as organized crime against chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china hosted a reception here today to mark the opening of the south african embassy in china , which is the first country to be built in south africa , which is a non - organized crime against chinese citizens .
he also said that the south african government would do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to cut the crime rate to zero and hopes to be a " zero " crime , fu said , expressing the hope that the safety of life and property of every foreigners working in south africa will be fully protected by local laws and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a broad concern over this .
the chinese ministry of foreign affairs has made representations to the south african side over this issue and has reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their sense of security and to strengthen unity and friendship among overseas chinese and to cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
lu yongxiang said that we sincerely sympathize with and mourn the victims ' families .
fu kangning said : we regret this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is now earnestly investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese woman chen jianqing who was killed in south africa on february 5 , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hunting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , criminals suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year have been arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims have been recovered .
on the possible impact of the incident of chinese citizens ' assassination , fu kangning said that these incidents indeed would have a negative impact on the trade , tourism , and other areas between the two countries , but from a long - term point of view , the impact should not be too big as it is .
the south african embassy has only set up a special office in the first 15 days of this year to help more than 2,000 chinese people to visit south africa , the official said .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.27 billion , up 23.0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive chinese citizens ' assassination in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , 20,331 chinese tourists visited south africa , a decrease of 14.99 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the towns and villages in south africa are all covered .
analysts here hold that the rich - poor gap in south africa is widening , the unemployment rate is high , and guns are rampant , and there is no death penalty deterrent , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash with their bodies and their homes , and this is more easily becoming the targets of criminal elements seeking money .

the international olympic committee announced the next day that it had sent out a liea to the winter olympics , and she had won the second winter olympics in the women 's 15 - kilometer individual game .
the two international winter second union ( iap ) made a two - year penalty decision on the sectarian ban on the same day .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimulants in the olympic games , and will be cancelled and deprived of their qualification for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the driver of a player carrying and using stimulant belonging to criminal activities is liable to direct arrest and investigation of an athlete using stimulant , and the lawyer who defects the law is still facing imprisonment ranging from three months to three years .
last december , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year - long bargaining and bargaining price , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athlete 's place during the winter olympics , but athletes with positive drug prosecutions will still be subject to investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
it has been reported that officials of the italian government overseeing the turin winter olympics , pasteur , have already handed over the doping incident to the reformatory procuratorate .
however , the ioc and peter canton have not confirmed the matter .
the two teams of the russian winter second team , anan dev , disclosed at noon on 17 june that leuka had already left turin and returned to the country .
he has been a member of the chinese sports official who has worked in the world anti - doping agency for many years . he said that once a leaf is sent back to china , this matter will eventually be a " crunch " .
shi kangcheng said : the international olympic committee and the italian government have always had no fodder on the issue of anti - doping at the winter olympics . even if italian procuratorial organs really intervene in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is very difficult .
according to the previous ruling of the case of the italian court using stimulant to the national athlete , the most serious punishment given by the bans is only the case in which the two countries were sentenced to imprisonment and suspended for the year .
therefore , a senior correspondent of the italian amaa said that the possibility of sending leia to prison is a little bit unwise , and that is , a fine is the most important thing .
pele also said that although the italian court could be tried out in a absence , the italian police could not possibly send a foreign guy to take back and serve the sentence .
if it sent a siege to refuse to accept the verdict , the italian side would also have no way to take her .
