the report , which has been published for as long as 92 , exp@@ ounds three sentences on the question of china 's military strength and the united states ' response to it , directly men@@ tions the fact that the united states has made a decision on the two most important issues , namely , the two ver@@ sions of the theory of china threat or the theory of " one china , " which is a major emerging and emerging power , and which is the most important and most important one to china .
the world military science research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar views before , this is the first time that the united states has made such a proposal in the report on the national defense strategy of the united states that china is the most likely to pose a new and emerging power that challenges the united states ' military affairs .
the report was for the first time clearly defined russia 's india - china threat as a emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , and in particular , it was a new challenge to the so - called " smart card " that was used to threaten china 's military threat .
the research fellow peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the " defense review report " formally submitted a report on the same day , us president bush also submitted to congress a government budget for 2007 , of which the national defense budget has reached $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the secret was added to the fact that the united states had launched military actions in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for 2007 would be $ 2 billion , and the us budget for the fiscal year would be $ 100 billion , setting a new record high , peng guang@@ qian said , almost equivalent to the rest of the world 's countries ' military spending and spending .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states has made a negative reaction to the hegem@@ onic practice of the united states causing a threat from the pentagon . the real purpose is to strive for more " national defense spending " and to create a favorable external environment for the huge us arms industry .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in several times in the white paper on china 's national defense , which was written by deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert , said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of state financial expenditure has taken as a whole has declined .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the number of foreign - funded enterprises in china was 3@@ 4.@@ 8 percent higher than in 1979 , and the proportion of china 's national defense spending in the same period was nearly 10 percentage points .
by 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - third of the united states .
the united states has a vast land area and a vast area of china 's territory . its military spending is so huge . what is the real military strength of the united states ?
peng guang@@ qian said :
the chinese arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively appra@@ ise the situation of china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that the two countries will strengthen cooperation in the military field .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development , practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been involved in any kind of arms race in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not made any diplomatic efforts in any other country , nor has it provided any military bases to other countries .
professor zhang qing@@ yuan , professor of the institute of international relations at beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

us government to send troops to help solve problems
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) the hamas cabinet has found a breakthrough in the cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang hao , huang hao , huang hao ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has obtained the victory of the legislative council , how to draw a new government blueprint for the new government has become a focus of attention at present .
hamas will pursue a new policy to directly influence the progress of the peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are stepping up their consultations to reach a consensus on the issue of the formation of the cabinet that involves the difficulty and sensitive point of future developments .
the " three stresses " education has become a major topic of concern for the people .
hamas win@@ s the cabinet , and some people are worried that hamas 's prime minister will be able to hold talks with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the chinese delegation , who is visiting egypt , is stressing that the hamas - led coalition government will be formed by the new palestinian government and will not recognize israel .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their willingness to accept an hamas government that is not in the hands of the people and to threaten to break economic aid to palestine and to send a tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making a flexible strategy to adjust its policy and to elect an independent candidate to be a policy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition to the maximum , the egyptian government recently held a meeting with the hamas leaders at home and abroad to elect an independent candidate to elect j@@ as@@ want al-@@ ass@@ ad , president of the board of directors of the islamic grand school .
this move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the united states has no choice but to make a decision on whether the prime minister 's office is to spend his house , but the most crucial one is to try as much as possible to dil@@ ute hamas 's hard@@ line leadership . only by doing so can it ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
the " three stresses " education is a major issue in the work of the party and government .
within the party , hamas has been facing the most serious challenge of the cabinet formation .
the palestinian newspaper " the day " analyzed that the hamas has adopted the method of gathering forces in the society through social welfare projects , but it has not been able to experience in governance and to cooperate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governance .
hamas will not be able to achieve its goal of building a political and social security system with the participation of the international community .
fat@@ ah is now in a state of opinion on whether to enter the cabinet , and the faction is in favor of participating in the new government , so as to do some things and to rej@@ ect hamas 's invitation . the other faction is willing to make a positive reaction to the opposition within the legislative council .
the source pointed out that in the wake of ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and the fat@@ ah movement have also reached a consensus on the distribution of the cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to form a framework of the legislative affairs commission to break away from the party - to - party cabinet .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clear - cut expert model , which is capable of providing a reliable basis for the specific list .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is not negl@@ ected to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , on 16 february , the new legislative council will be elected after the new legislative committee takes office .
the " three stresses " education is a major political issue that is not a topic of concern for the armed forces .
the weapons in hamas are the basis for the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude and resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and refuse to take part in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ab@@ b@@ as stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is the choice of strategy for the organization .
armed problems actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has been a leader in the process of democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to separate the armed forces of various factions into the palestinian national authority , and the people are now over@@ thr@@ own , but they did not receive extensive response , and they were also attacked by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ ha ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of the people from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations to s@@ well .
the chief executive of hamas , who is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are all in their own hands and ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate the right to manage security .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other institutions under the new government , and the ministry of interior will be under control .
however , the parties are still discussing this sensitive issue .

beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state council has decided to set up a special power supervision and management committee to monitor the power supply in 2005 , according to a responsible official of the state power supervision and administration commission ( s@@ as@@ ac ) on tuesday .

the international olympic committee has all along stipulated that athletes should be held accoun@@ table for the use of stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and they will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of the qualifications for the competition , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes are still required to carry and use stimul@@ ants in criminal activities , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate and use the stimul@@ ants to protect the environment .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard efforts , re@@ paid the price of over@@ due pressure . after the agreement was reached , the two sides agreed to make a decision on the matter of the use of the italian athletes during the winter olympics .
after the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side had already made a decision four days before the opening of the winter olympics , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the place of the athletes , but the drug - tested athletes will still be subj@@ ected to the investigation by the italian procuratorial authorities .
it has been reported that the italian government has supervis@@ ed the activities of the z@@ ig@@ u@@ ang@@ y@@ am@@ an winter olympics , and has sent le@@ v@@ an 's stimul@@ ants to du@@ tch the case to the du@@ tch procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ ry have also made some progress on this matter .
russia 's winter bi@@ ds are in the first place in the northern part of the country , the first in the country , the country 's northern k@@ ur@@ ds , said the russian delegation .
he has been a member of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , a chinese sports official , who has been in charge of the anti - d@@ oping agency , said that once the le@@ av@@ ages are returned to china , this matter will eventually be un@@ settled .
shi said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have held a meeting in the winter olympic games to discuss the issue of anti - d@@ oping agents .
according to the previous italian athletes ' hab@@ it@@ ual use of stimul@@ ants , the number of illegal immigrants has increased by a big margin .
therefore , the italian ant@@ a news agency senior reporter p@@ el@@ a said that the dispatch of le@@ v to prison was a very rare and un@@ certain one . the top - not@@ ch was a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court can conduct a abs@@ ence trial , the italian police have not been able to go abroad to send the le@@ v to the justice .
if the le@@ av@@ ages refused to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side also took her to the other way .
