( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time personnel and graduates of higher education become main employees
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau announced on the 6@@ th that the labor service wage guidance price for the year 2006 is 120 , an 11 - month increase over the previous year .
according to an assessment by a relevant expert of the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , the number of hours of employees in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a report in china youth daily , college graduates and part - time employees are major components of the contingent of hours workers .
through direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time personnel , and the percentage is 5@@ 1.@@ 11 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally relatively high , and they mainly engage in relatively strong technical work , such as transl@@ ation posts , with a combined employment ratio of up to 8@@ 1.7 percent , and fit@@ ness of 6@@ 1.6 percent .
the high income is an important reason why many people are engaged in both hours and work .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can be tens of thousands of yuan , and it is hard to ask for a single job , just like the rum@@ or transl@@ ation , and the monthly income of an hour - job office can reach more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time financial mar@@ ried cou@@ sin@@ s .
to satisfy individual interests , expanding the scope of their knowledge is also a favor@@ ite reason for both part - time hours of work .
for example , mr. gu , who served as the manager of the human resources department of a enterprise , will take a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign - funded representative office .
mr ko@@ o considered that the greatest income from part - time employment was to keep up up@@ d@@ ating his knowledge and to have the opportunity to involve another field . of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month also had a certain en@@ tic@@ ement .
as the thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours of work posts is low , the employment form is flexible and free , and many graduates who are now seeking employment are also gradually favor@@ ed by them , and 14@@ 8 percent of the hours of work are graduates of tertiary and secondary vocational schools in the past three years .
i did not want to work for an hour at the beginning , but i felt that it was better than working for nine to five months later than working in the dprk .
after gradu@@ ation from university student huang , the work he found was not as good as expected and finally hung up his name at a guesthouse . he used pi@@ an@@ o to play the background music .
i am quite satisfied with the current work , and the environment is good at one hour and 100 yuan . i am now looking for a few hours of work .
it is understood that the work of an hour has become a experience accumulated by some graduates who are currently seeking jobs to improve their skills in work , and help improve their skills in commun@@ icating with one another and improving their skills in social development .
the graduates are engaged in the work of hours , mainly in the fields of knowledge and skills , such as those with relatively strong professional skills , age - oriented and performance skills .
some of the job skills required for the hours work , such as food promo@@ ter and assistant , etc. , were not high enough .
the data show that among the employed persons , the number of unemployed persons was 3@@ 9@@ ,000 , of which the proportion of unemployed persons in the retail sector was 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the proportion of food and drink was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 7 percent , and the number of hours of employees becoming important channels for the unemployed .

second , closely revol@@ ve around the overall situation of the work of the party and the state , closely revol@@ ve around major issues in reform , development , and stability , and work closely around hot and difficult problems of common concern to the masses of the people , and constantly enhance the practical results of the work of the people 's congress .
third , give play to the characteristics and advantages of the work of the people 's congresses , uphold democratic centr@@ alism , act according to the procedures , and make a collective decision on the issue .

prc expert : us ' military threat ' in china ' ground@@ less accus@@ ations
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a " new security council " in the " four - year defense review report " to the congress a few days ago , which is the first time to say that china is the emerging big country that may pose a challenge to the us military .
experts believe that this is a ground@@ less accus@@ ation and a tou@@ ching of the china military threat theory , and a prov@@ oc@@ ative act of interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new national defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report exp@@ ounds china 's military strength and the us measures to deal with it .
yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow of the institute of world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had repeatedly expressed similar views , this was the first time in the united states to propose a strategy report on defense strategy that would most likely pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es for the first time the status of russia 's emerging strategic ad@@ versary , especially the so - called china military threat theory , has been given more attention .
major general peng guang@@ qian , a research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense review report " officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a report on the defense budget for the fiscal year 2007 , including a total of 4@@ 3@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the war is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us will not be able to increase its defense budget for 2007 .
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states ' tricks to create a threat to other countries reflected the consistent style of the pentagon to create enemies , and its real purpose was to secure more national defense funds and to provide more financial support for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
he has attended many times the writing of the white paper on china 's national defense , and said that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has been on the decline .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for more than 10 percent of the total national financial expenditure for the same period .
china 's national defense expenditure for 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - third of the us national defense spending , and the per capita national military spending was only about one - 60 of the us , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ty us military expenditure .
the area of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as that of china 's territory , but the difference in military spending is so huge . in the end , who is the military force that exceeds the legitimate defense needs is self - evident and self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate the status of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper entitled " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and adop@@ ts a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been either in or in the future , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent troops and manpower to other countries , and the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , only a few dozen of which are deployed in the asian region .
zhu feng , professor of the beijing university international relations institute , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas seeks new cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form a cabinet to seek a breakthrough in the palestinian - israeli conflict
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the next policy direction of all the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points that involve future development of the situation .
who will the premier 's position bl@@ o@@ om ?
after hamas obtained the power to form a cabinet , some people outside the world are worried that there might be differences between hamas and the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader mar@@ shall , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated the international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they do not accept a hamas government with real power and thus threaten the continu@@ ation of economic aid to palestine and the transfer of taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent person is a policy of compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the greatest extent , the leaders of hamas at home and abroad who gathered together recently decided to elect independent president of the board of directors of the ch@@ aw@@ al@@ lah islamic university at home and abroad , j@@ ay@@ ak@@ ar@@ i al-@@ j@@ a@@ har@@ ir@@ i , who is also the president of the board of directors of the saudi islamic university , to serve as the new prime minister .
this measure has not yet been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who the premier 's position will be bl@@ o@@ oming , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should do his best to play down hamas 's tough haw@@ k t@@ ones , and only in this way can he ensure the success of the formation of the cabinet .
how should power be allocated ( sub@@ head )
within the party , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
an article carried by the palestine newspaper " daily " analyzed that hamas has gathered together people through social welfare projects , but lacks experience in governance and is not in con@@ form@@ ity with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has governing experience .
hamas proposed establishing political relations with fat@@ ah after the election and jointly establishing a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not yet given a positive response to the issue .
at present , there are different opinions about whether to join the cabinet or not , and one faction advocates participating in the new government , and the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas to make a positive move in the legislative yuan .
according to informed sources , under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ as@@ ive , fat@@ ah is gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also exchange views on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative council framework to separate itself from a party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is not at all a form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , after the new legislative council was inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where is the armed ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very hard - line attitude , and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refused to take part in politics .
hamas leader al-@@ sh@@ ass@@ er stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces are actually part of the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas was elected the first largest legisl@@ ator of the legislative council through democratic and free means , and has made its subordinate armed factions like the z@@ ang@@ z@@ ang@@ z@@ an brig@@ ades leg@@ alize their ways to bring them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that armed forces of all factions be unified into palestinian national authority , but it did not receive widespread response and was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( je@@ h@@ ad ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose ties with armed factions , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brig@@ ades , the f@@ att@@ an eag@@ les , etc.
hamas , who is in charge of forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in charge of all their own affairs and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense organizations are managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no such thing as the following .

since it was the first time china released an ul@@ tr@@ a - geograph@@ ic investigation report , the " 2005 china polar survey report " also made a breakthrough in the development of china 's polar exploration cause , which started in the early 1980 's .

in 1997 , china became a member of the north pol@@ e science committee and won the right to speak and make decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that in the past 20 years , china 's polar expedi@@ tion has grown from nothing to do , and has developed from a large scale to a ship like a ship in the south of the island to a scientific inspection system , that is , the " three - dimen@@ sional " long - range station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic built in february 1989 , the ant@@ arc@@ tic middle station in february 1989 , and the northern pol@@ e station in july 2004 , and the long@@ est mountain station
according to the " report , " by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 scientific expedi@@ tions in the ant@@ arc@@ tic region to conduct two scientific expedi@@ tions with a s@@ now@@ y ship as a platform for the north pol@@ e scientific inspection in 1995 , and to date , the number of vessels in the country has exceeded 3,000 .
at present , we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic observation station and the first ant@@ arc@@ tic inland investigation station in china to conduct feasibility studies .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of hard work , china 's polar exploration cause has been a major part of the world 's polar exploration , but it is still far from the other major polar countries .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui revealed that in the future , china will publish an annual polar inspection report .

high - definition digital television becomes mainstream in the united states
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the united states has set up a new high - resolution television network in the united states , which is expected to be the largest television market in the world , with its television broadc@@ asters also stepping up their efforts to launch a corresponding high - resolution television program .
the us n@@ ick - off american r@@ ug@@ by - type ol@@ ive - type tour@@ na@@ ment has become the hot - duty competition for the american broadcasting industry to welcome the television high qing era .
according to a recent report in the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill requiring that the american broadcasting industry must complete a broadcast of the current simul@@ ated television signal on 17 february 200@@ 9 , and only release digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of american television programs has already set a clear timetable .
on the one hand , the popul@@ arization of high - resolution digital television depends on consumers to buy television sets , while on the other hand , it depends on the production institutions to provide high - resolution digital programs .
although digital television has been mentioned repeatedly in the past few years , it has never become a reality .
this problem has turned for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the us consumer electronics association , the volume of digital television sets will exceed that of traditional television sets for the first time this year , and 8@@ 5.@@ 5 percent of the digital television sets are high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient man@@ ual - made kid@@ ne@@ ys
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) a japanese east china sea university research institute developed a bi@@ os@@ af@@ il - making method which is not only in the same way as human kid@@ ney , but also in the same way it has the function of maintaining the functions of material elements and the size of the body is small and easy to trans@@ plant . with the study in depth , it is expected that the patients will be able to bring the voice of patients with kid@@ ney diseases .
according to a recent report by ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological - made kid@@ ne@@ ys are mainly composed of two parts , and the part is fil@@ tr@@ ated from blood to fil@@ ter some of the living budd@@ ha who made waste and water@@ f@@ ills and made of water in the blood . the other part is the re@@ entry of the blood of the person who re@@ returned to blood with components of the raw water .
the people made the kid@@ ne@@ ys and the people made the tor@@ pe@@ does and made the w@@ ire of the middle - air , which were formed by the inner ring of the people , and the inner side of the body of the people 's w@@ ing@@ t@@ les , which has the function of dis@@ charging the functions of the sub@@ stitu@@ te - waste .
this type of cell@@ s can make several blood trans@@ fu@@ sion analysis of diseases caused by multiple blood trans@@ fu@@ sion , and can make a long - lasting analysis of the causes of evol@@ ution of sub@@ stances into m@@ am@@ mon@@ ic ac@@ id and return to blood , and at the same time , they can also make sure that the foo@@ ds and the materials of the body are re@@ entered into blood .
in the past , the difference between the arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney manufacturing and the use of le@@ ak pressure to fil@@ ter the waste cannot be completely removed , and there is no need to re@@ use the components of am@@ mon@@ ic ac@@ id and other components to return to the blood .
researchers used mountain go@@ ats to conduct a biological human kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experi@@ ment , and the use of pi@@ g 's sk@@ in cell@@ s in the middle - air sil@@ k line of the human - made kid@@ ne@@ ys .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human kid@@ ney had already played its function .
at present , they are developing and using the biological kid@@ ne@@ ys of human kid@@ ney cell@@ s and will start clin@@ ical research after veri@@ fying their safety .

xinhua news agency , du@@ ling , february 17 ( xinhua ) the election of the ruling parties in the country may be un@@ settled , according to a news analysis
xinhua news agency reporter , yu ying , ding ying
although italy has repeatedly issued an order , it is still un@@ certain that the use of stimul@@ ant athletes during the winter olympics in tur@@ in may be facing the flood of hel@@ pers , but judging from all the circumstances , this kind of situation is not very likely to occur in the first starting point of this winter olympics .
the tur@@ in winter olympics opened on the 16@@ th the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since its opening on the 16@@ th . or@@ mit@@ ory was found to have used banned drug cards .

the international winter med@@ al alliance made a decision on the same day to send the ban@@ ov@@ a ban match for two years .
the i@@ oc has all along stipulated that athletes have been found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games and will be removed from their performance and depriv@@ ed of the right to participate in the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes who carry and use stimul@@ ants are criminal acts and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate and use stimul@@ ant athletes to test the law and face three challenges .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of long - standing sw@@ arms , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to conduct a joint exercise for athletes to use stimul@@ ant in accordance with the italian law during this winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the winter olympic games opening and promised that police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' residence during the winter olympics . however , the young athletes who are positive in the drug examination will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the du@@ tch winter olympics officials , p@@ es@@ and@@ t@@ te , has already sent the d@@ oping incident to the du@@ tch procuratorial organ .
however , the international olympic committee and p@@ es@@ and@@ on himself have not confirmed this .
russian winter di@@ agn@@ os@@ is medical officer and@@ re@@ w mir@@ t@@ ov revealed at noon on 17 july that the two teams had sent their le@@ av@@ ers to the country and returned to china .
he has worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that once a le@@ av@@ a is sent back to the country , this matter may ultimately be un@@ settled .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been working hard to deal with the issue of anti - d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and even if the italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in the matter , it is hard to say that the result is very , he said .
according to the previous practice of the italian athletes using stimul@@ ant incidents , the banned persons are the most severely punished .
therefore , senior italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ ans@@ a journalist pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a to prison is very small , and the most of the top is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a trial of abs@@ ence , the italian police could not possibly send them back to their country to serve their prison term .
if a le@@ av@@ er ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will not have any way to take it .
