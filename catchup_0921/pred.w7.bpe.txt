the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the report , which lasted for 92 p@@ ages , exp@@ ounds on china 's military power issue and the us countermeasures it should take , has been directly put forward on 15 occasions , and has also been published in the report .
the research fellow of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences yao yun@@ zhu said : although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time the united states has put forward in the report on its national defense strategy , and china is the newly emerging big power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia 's ar@@ ter@@ y as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china p@@ aw@@ n , and the united states has given more attention to the so - called china military threat .
peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " , on the same day , us president bush also submitted a report on the defense budget for the fiscal year 2007 to congress , including the defense budget of $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9 billion .
if , plus the purpose of conducting military operations in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian held that the united states ' specul@@ ation of the threat of other countries reflects the pentagon 's consistent style of making enemies out of the predic@@ ament , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide the us military industrial group with more profits .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has repeatedly taken part in the military expert written by the chinese defense white paper , saying that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased , but accounting for more than 10 percent of the national financial expenditures during the same period .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures accounted for more than 10 percent of the total national financial expenditures of the same period .
china 's defense expenditures in 2005 were 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , which was only about one - fourth of the united states ' per capita military expenditure is equivalent to about us $ 1 / 60 . military personnel ' per capita military expenditure is about us $ 1 / 30 .
the us territory area is generally quite similar to china 's territory , and the gap between military expenditure and military expenditure is so huge . who is the military strength that goes beyond the normal defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china will firmly take the road of peaceful development and implement a defensive national defense policy .
china has never had any future of its relations with any country in the past and now , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a military force or a p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases abroad , and it has only deployed military bases in asia , totaling more than 100,000 troops .
professor zhu feng of the international relations institute of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relationship in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
ram@@ an , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
what kind of new policy hamas will adopt will directly affect the relevant parties ' policies toward the next step of the peace process .
at the same time , the us and israel 's resistance attitude has added a vari@@ able to the future of the hamas government .
at present , the palestinian parties are stepping up consultation to discuss the issue of the establishment of a cabinet , which involves the future development of the situation and the sensitive point of the cabinet .
the post of prime minister has fl@@ own out and wh@@ it@@ e@@ wash@@ ed the post of prime minister .
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people were worried that hamas 's prime minister might have had differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ah@@ med , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which is formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that holds the power of reality and that they will threaten to inter@@ rup@@ t economic aid to palestine and transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making a flexible strategic adjustment , and it is a choice that can be made to select independent people .
it is reported that in order to obtain international approval as much as possible , hamas and domestic leaders in egypt recently decided to elect an independent person to the board of directors of the j@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta islamic university , who is the new prime minister .
this move has yet to be responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter who the prime minister is in office , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to weak@@ en hamas 's hard - line hu@@ e , and only by so doing can it guarantee the success of the cabinet formation .
how to distribution power ( sub@@ head )
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of adequate experience in governance .
the " daily " of palestine analyzed the situation and said that hamas has gathered together people and people through social welfare projects , but there is no experience in ruling the country and is also different from the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has a ruling experience .
hamas has proposed to establish a political partner with fat@@ ah after the election , to jointly form a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
at present , there are no views about whether or not the cabinet is in the cabinet , and one faction stands for participating in the new government , so that it can be done . the other faction is willing to make a positive opposition party in the legislative affairs commission .
informed sources pointed out that under the advice of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually began to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold discussions on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee framework that is out of control .
hamas also designed a clean and white expert government , which is a specific list of un@@ identified experts .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - style government is no less able to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the new term of the legislative yuan on 16 february was nom@@ inated by the prime minister and will be formed in three to five weeks .
where will armed forces go from ?
the weapons in hamas are another challenge facing the formation of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in the administration .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the armed forces are in fact a matter of leg@@ ality and the issue of the management of armed forces at two levels .
hamas 's election of the first largest party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom has been recognized internationally , and the armed forces of its subordinate armed forces are equally legal .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of various factions be unified to the people 's army of the palestinian national authority , but it has not received wide response , and it has also been attacked by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ a@@ har@@ t ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , most of whom are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some subordinate armed forces with sl@@ ack organization relations , such as ar@@ s@@ as@@ ak@@ i marty@@ rs , who are in charge of dr@@ as@@ tically modi@@ fied mag@@ n@@ ates .
hamas , which is in charge of forming a cabinet , must have a thorough understanding of how to manage these armed forces that are in power , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management power .
ab@@ b@@ as is inten@@ tionally in charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organs , while the new government 's interior ministry is in charge of the administration .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , so far there is no such thing .

in 1997 , china became a member of the commission of science of the arc@@ tic , winning the right to speak and make policy decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 - plus years , china 's extreme ge@@ opol@@ i@@ tical study has never been carried out and constantly developed . the initial ar@@ ter@@ y has formed a ship of the third station , the north pol@@ e science research system , which is : the south china pol@@ e city station established in february 198@@ 5 , and the south pol@@ e - mountain station established in february 1989 , and the nan@@ jiang - hebei - zhu@@ hai station was established in july , 2004 ,
according to the " report , " as of the end of 2005 , china has organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific research projects , with the name of the li@@ an@@ xiang wh@@ ar@@ f as the platform for the north pol@@ e scientific research . the survey also conducted two surveys on the arc@@ tic , which have been conducted by the far east pol@@ e , has so far more than 3,000 arch@@ ae@@ olog@@ ists throughout the country , and has conducted on - the - site investigation of the arc@@ tic .
at present , we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic investigation station , and also china 's first inter@@ contin@@ ental observation station .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of effort , china 's extreme exploration project has achieved a great success in the world 's ul@@ tr@@ a - earth study , but it is still far from other countries that are mainly conducting polar survey .
he said .

china 's electric power production is still facing severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state electricity regulatory commission ( s@@ g@@ c ) said on the 13@@ th that although the overall situation of power production in 2005 maintained a stable momentum , the production safety of electricity still faces severe challenges .
shi yu@@ bo , vice chairman of the state power control commission , said at the fifth national power production committee ( expanded ) meeting here that in 2005 , china 's electric power production safety production was generally stable and complete the completion of the tasks of the peak season for electricity supply and power supply , and that china 's power supply and power supply was able to cope with the in@@ tru@@ sion of natural disasters , and to ensure the safe and stable operation of the power supply system and the safe operation of electric power
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the power supply and demand situation and the large amount of new generating units put into operation , the production of electricity production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional tur@@ bul@@ ence - filled period , which will still exist , and the supply and demand situation in some areas remain tight , and the price - ben@@ ign mechanism for electricity has not yet been formed , leading to a rather big problem in the supply of coal , and the problem of the failure to effectively control the decrease in coal quality has not been effectively controlled .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed , how to maintain the stability of the workers ' ranks and ensure normal production order will become new problems facing us .
in view of the 2006 power production safety work , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of the management of electric power production , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of electric power safety , enhance the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen the coordination and cooperation of the power plant network , and jointly safeguard the safety of the power station 's power station 's system , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the dam safety and informationization work
it is reported that in light of the new situation in the management of electric power security , the china power regulatory commission will conduct a survey on the " interim regulations on the investigation of power production accidents " that have been promulgated this year . at the same time , the supporting documents on the safety of the power station 's major dam and the protection of the second power system will be issued and implemented in succession this year .

because many chinese do not understand english , there are cash in their body and home , and it is more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal elements ' attempt to make money and attack .

we should make public the 5@@ 2@@ 43 public notice to society , and the number of such reports recently reported by various localities and over 700 coal mines that have been closed down to the truth .
we should regard closing down enterprises as routine work , and constantly close down those enterprises that are in@@ capable of causing pollution to resources and are unable to meet the safety requirements .
the safety management of coal mines should be strengthened .
we must immediately rectify the phenomenon of a small number of large state - owned mines managing their sl@@ opes , guide the dis@@ orderly management of small mines , and establish a standardized security management system .
in particular , we must grasp key state - owned coal mines and absolutely not allow super - capable and excessive production of surplus personnel .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : sending a large - scale kidn@@ apping incident may be un@@ certain .
du@@ an , february 17 ( xinhua ) news analysis : it is possible that the incident of sending a ven@@ er@@ e@@ a to the united states may be un@@ certain
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly said that tur@@ in winter olympics was being un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ant athletes during the winter olympics , it may be facing the dev@@ il of hel@@ l , but it is now seen from various situations that such a situation is not too likely to occur at this winter olympics .
du@@ ling winter olympics games opens on 16 april , the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since the opening ceremony , o said he sent len@@ a to find out the use of illegal drugs .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that the sending of le@@ on@@ id was left by the winter olympics . she won the winter gi@@ ft at this winter olympics . she won the gold med@@ al of 15 kilometers in the women 's competition .
the two international winter par@@ ades made a positive response to the issue of the three - year ban on the group of the same day .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are found to be using stimul@@ ant at the olympics and will be eliminated and depriv@@ ed of the quali@@ fication for participating in the olympic games .
however , according to the italian law , athletes carry and use stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ant athletes , so as to test the law on their body for three months to three years .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard - pressed barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and the two sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with the italian law during this winter olympics .
through the unremitting efforts of the i@@ oc , italy has made a four - day concession before the opening of the winter olympics , and promised that the police will not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place during the winter olympics games , but the pharmaceutical prosecu@@ tors will still accept investigations by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government over@@ takes officials of the du@@ ver@@ in winter olympics games , and per@@ ry has sent the stimul@@ ant incident to the du@@ tch prosecu@@ tor 's office .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ ry have not confirmed this matter .
the two teams of russia 's winter team , and@@ re@@ v , revealed at noon on 17 april that sending le@@ af had left tur@@ in and returned to the country .
he was once a member of the chinese sports official who had been working in the world anti - d@@ oping organization for many years , and said that once he sent a le@@ f@@ tist to china , this matter could eventually be resolved without a single deal .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been fighting against d@@ oping at the winter olympics , and there has been no way of resolving the problem of the disease , even if italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in the matter , it is hard to say that the result is not so .
in the past , italy used stimul@@ ant to use italian athletes , the penalty case for those who violated the law was the most severe punishment .
therefore , senior italian security news reporter pi@@ er@@ re said that sending a le@@ af to prison is likely to be a m@@ ess of the mag@@ n@@ ates , and most of the amount of fines is imposed .
p@@ el@@ i@@ el@@ i also said that although the italian court can hold a trial , italian police cannot go abroad to send the le@@ on@@ id back to prison .
if a le@@ af refused to accept the ruling , italy would not have to take her .
