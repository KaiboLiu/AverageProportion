chinese expert : us pre@@ ach@@ ing military threat to china is unreasonable accus@@ ations
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to build a new system of high - tech arms sales to the us congress , which is expected to be completed in the next few days , according to a report of the pentagon
experts believe that this is a serious challenge to china 's normal national defense construction . they ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate the china military threat theory , and they are a prov@@ ocation to china 's internal affairs .
the " four - point defense appraisal report " is the new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
this long - term , page 92 report is used in three areas to exp@@ ound china 's military strength and the united states ' response . the report has a total of 15 direct reports .
the chinese academy of military sciences research fellow yao yun@@ zhu said : although the united states has been in the process of expressing similar views on many occasions , this is the first time the united states has made a report on the strategic defense of national defense , which is the most likely to constitute a military challenge to the united states .
the first report of this incident clearly defin@@ es russia 's role as a " new strategic ri@@ val " , and it is particularly necessary to make a comprehensive analysis of the so - called " military threat " of china .
the chinese academy of military sciences research fellow , rear admir@@ al peng guang@@ qian , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense assessment report , " the same report on the same day , us president bush also made a report to congress on the defense budget for 2007 . one of the items is the defense budget of 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 billion us dollars .
if the tu@@ mors are added to the fact that the military action taken in iraq and afghanistan is added , the us fiscal year 2007 will be around the corner of 5@@ 00@@ 00 - billion us dollars , creating a new historical high , p@@ att@@ en , said , the reason why this is almost the same as other countries in the world in terms of military spending .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states gu@@ ess that the threat of other countries ' threat reflects the pentagon 's hegem@@ onist act of creating a false impression , and its true purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and create a huge us arms industry group .
experts said that the united states ' huge military spending is much less than that of the united states , and china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times in the chinese white paper on national defense , and said : in the 199@@ 0s , along with the development of the economy , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national fiscal expenditure in the same period has shown a decline .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the number of people in china 's national defense expenditures accounted for 4@@ 6.@@ 9 percent of the total national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 totaled 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , an increase of only 4.@@ 9 percent over the previous year .
the us territory and the chinese territory are far from being divided . the military spending is very different .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that the two countries will continue to cooperate in the military field .
the " 2004 china national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been involved in any future .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other country , nor has it provided any military base to other countries .
professor li qing@@ n@@ ian of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the development of constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century .

china , hamas to hold cabinet meeting
xinhua news agency , ram@@ an , february 9 ,
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 27 , by reporter hao wang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a new government blueprint , which has become a major issue of international concern at present .
hamas will pursue what new policy to be implemented directly aff@@ ects the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the united states and israel have also made a more important change in their attitude of resisting the attacks .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future developments .
the chinese premier 's post has a lot of money to go to the home
hamas won the cabinet , and outside people are worried that hamas prime minister mu@@ en@@ te@@ fering may be connected with the current supreme leader .
moreover , the chinese side , who is on a visit to egypt , has stressed that the hamas - led new government will not change its stance on the issue of israel .
the united states and israel explicitly expressed that they would not accept a hamas government that holds the power , and threatened to break the economic aid and pressure on the palestinian side by force .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas from making a flexible strategic adjustment . it will not be possible to select an independent person to be a dis@@ cre@@ et policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the international recognition to the maximum , the group of hamas members and the public in egypt recently decided to select an independent candidate , mu@@ shar@@ a , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , as the new prime minister .
this move has not been endorsed by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the united states has not taken any action to change its policy of " one country , two systems " , regardless of the size of the prime minister 's post .
the chinese government has always attached importance to the issue of how to distribu@@ te power
in the internal aspect , the hamas cabinet is facing the greatest challenge , that is , it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian " sun@@ sh@@ ine " carried an article , saying that hamas has made a lot of efforts to win over the people through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and has a very close relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the ruling experience .
hamas will not be able to get involved in the conflict with fat@@ ah after the election , and will jointly establish a coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive support to it .
fat@@ ah is now in the middle of the middle east , and is not in favor of taking part in the new government , so as to do something and the other party ref@@ uses hamas to accept the invitation , and is willing to make a positive opposition party in the legislative council .
the source said that the united states has not made any decision to withdraw its troops from iraq , and has been trying to use force against iraq .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah have also established a mechanism for the cabinet posts to be assigned to the government .
in addition , another way is to establish the framework of the legislative council , which is divor@@ ced from the party 's subordinate cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a " clean - up " government , but it is not easy to know the specific name list .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is not out of the question of forming a cabinet for ligh@@ tening external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , on 16 april , the new legislative council will hold a meeting to nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative council assum@@ es office .
the chinese armed forces are bound to follow the path of development .
the weapons in hamas are the main weapons to be set up by the new government .
the united states and israel are very tough and resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and refuse to use its guns to take power .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the only strategy of the organization .
armed problems are in fact included in the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas has been a country that has been established through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to include all factions in the palestinian authority .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security organizations and over 2,000 people from france , fat@@ ah , and israel .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organization relations that are s@@ oundly and s@@ oundly subordinate . for instance , the ab@@ u s@@ ay@@ a marty@@ rs brigade , the organization department of fat@@ ah , and other members .
the chief executive of the cabinet must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces , which are in charge of the government , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management rights .
according to local media , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , and civil defense departments , while the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of the ministry of interior .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no words have been made .

china 's power safety is still facing a grim challenge
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the china national tourism administration ( s@@ as@@ ac ) , which is the first power industry to be established in 2005 , has maintained steady growth , said a responsible person of the state power supervision and control commission here today
the state power regulatory commission vice chairman shi yu@@ bo said at the national conference on power safety and production held here that the state power regulatory commission has decided to implement the reform plan for power production by 2005 , and to complete the work of the power - generating work in the summer .

these challenges include : the regional cy@@ ber@@ port , the d@@ uration of the vac@@ ancy of power , the power supply and demand situation in some areas still remain tight , and the price of electricity is still not yet formed , resulting in the continued shortage of power supply in power supply , and the coal supply is also the problem of the lack of effective control of coal quality .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be constantly exposed , and how to maintain the stability of the workers ' contingent and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the fact that power production safety work in 2006 has been in place , shi yu@@ bo said : it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of power safety production and management , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism of emergency management of power safety , enhance the ability to deal with emer@@ gen@@ cies , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power plants and power networks , and continue to do a good job in supervising the safety of the major power stations and building the information industry .

china 's total social consumption in 2005 will reach 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 8@@ 9 billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t hours , up 13.@@ 4@@ 47 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand still being tight , the problem of coal , electricity , and transportation is conspicuous , and all power enterprises should take effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , the power industry throughout the country did not have major accidents in power production .
the number of accidents involving power gr@@ i@@ ds was 74 times , 1@@ 27 , 4@@ 27 in the same period last year , and 13@@ 2 in the same period last year .
