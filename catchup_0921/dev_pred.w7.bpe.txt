beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government and people are looking forward to the establishment of a new us military alliance , which is formally submitted to congress a few days ago , the pentagon said china is the most likely country to have a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a want@@ on criticism of china 's normal national defense building , and it is a great challenge to china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report will be used to descri@@ be the issue of china 's military strength and the us 's response to the issue , and the report has been directly mentioned on 15 occasions in china or in china , two in china , and two in terms of reference , namely , the " east tur@@ kistan " issue , which is the most important and emerging country in china 's military competition with the united states . if the united states does not have any counter@@ measure , china may develop in a very dangerous
the chinese academy of military sciences ' research fellow yao yun@@ zhu said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has made a proposal in its defense strategy report on china , which is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's role as a spr@@ ing@@ board for the first time , and makes it particularly necessary to make a decision on the so - called chinese military threat theory .
peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the united states president bush also submitted a report to congress on fiscal and economic development for 2007 .
if the ba@@ g is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the united states will have to pay for the defense budget for fiscal 2007 , which will exceed $ 500 billion , setting a new record , p@@ ag@@ en said , adding that this is almost equivalent to the world 's entire military action of all other countries .
peng guang@@ qian believes that the united states is a fabr@@ ication of the threat of other countries , and it reflects the consistent style of the pentagon to create an enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds to provide a pretext for the us huge arms industry group to ear@@ n more profits .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has participated in the writing of the white paper on china 's national defense on many occasions , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has been on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over 10 percent of the total national defense expenditures during the same period .
china 's defense expenditures in 2005 were 2@@ 4.@@ 4@@ 65 - trillion yuan , only about one - third of the united states , and the per capita military spending is equivalent to approximately one - six@@ ty percent of the us military spending , and the per - capita military expenditure of the us military is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military 's .
the us territory and china 's territory are r@@ oughly similar , and the military expenditure is so huge . what exactly is the military strength of which is in the end exceeds the legitimate defense needs ? this is not enough to say .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense for 2004 " says that china will firmly take the road of peaceful development and implement a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been able to do anything in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a military force or a p@@ aw@@ n to other countries , and the united states has over 100 military bases abroad . in the asia region alone , more than 10@@ 0,000 people have been deployed .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , and enhance mutual understanding and trust and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek a breakthrough
l@@ am@@ an@@ la , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has found a new cabinet in the region
xinhua news agency reporter ha@@ o@@ huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly influence the next step of the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added a vari@@ able to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations , and discussing the issue of forming a cabinet involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the post of prime minister has fl@@ ower down ?
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , people outside the world were worried that hamas prime minister th@@ ak@@ sin shin@@ aw@@ at@@ ra might have a difference with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas , leader of hamas who is visiting egypt , stressed that the palestinian new government formed by hamas would not recognize israel , and this tough signal was also aggrav@@ ated by the international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they will not accept a hamas government with real power and use this to threaten to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not possible for an independent person to choose the best option .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition , egypt 's hamas , both at home and abroad , recently decided to elect an independent person , ch@@ al@@ ab@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the university of ch@@ al@@ ab@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant authorities .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who is in the post of prime minister , the most important thing is that the candidate for prime minister should try to play down hamas 's hard - line fla@@ v@@ or . only thus can it guarantee the success of the cabinet formation .
how to alloc@@ ate power to the state
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks enough experience in governance .
palestinian newspaper " day " analyzed that hamas has been trying to get the people to get together through social welfare projects , but in governing , it lacks experience and is not in keeping with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has been a ruling experience .
hamas proposed a new security framework with fat@@ ah after the election to form a national coalition government with the fat@@ ah , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there is no difference in opinion about whether or not fat@@ ah is in the cabinet , and one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus doing something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to make a show of the intelligence of hamas , and is willing to be a pro - active opposition party for the legislative yuan .
the source said that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also discuss the distribution of cabinet positions and make a counter@@ charge .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework and remove the cabinet of the party from its jurisdiction .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clean - up government , but the specific list was un@@ clear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technological expert - type government is not a form of cabinet - setting to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will be nom@@ inated after the new legislative council takes office on 16 march . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
the course of armed forces going to follow ( sub@@ head )
the weapons in hamas are another challenge facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is extremely tough , and it resolutely demands that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect the ruling party by taking part in the government .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ash@@ ar stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic option for the organization .
the armed forces issue in fact contains the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces at the two levels .
hamas 's election of the first major party in the legisl@@ ature through democracy and freedom has been acknowledged internationally , making it difficult for its subordin@@ ates to be armed by the same kind of legi@@ tim@@ acy to unify it in the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of various factions be unified as a rein@@ forc@@ ement of the palestinian national authority , but did not receive extensive respon@@ ses , and was also met by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ hamas ) .
at present , palestine has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them come from fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some subordinate armed forces with lo@@ ose organizational relations , such as tam@@ ak@@ i 's war@@ ri@@ or , p@@ ag@@ er , and the haw@@ k of f@@ aw@@ n .
hamas , who is in charge of forming a cabinet , must have a thorough understanding of how to manage these armed forces that are in charge of their own affairs and to ration@@ ally alloc@@ ate security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense organizations are managed by the new government 's interior ministry .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further document .

beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government and the south african government have been working hard to promote the development of the relations between the two countries , said chinese ambassador to south africa k@@ on@@ in here today
he also said that the south african government would do its utmost to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
he said that the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero and hopes that each of the two countries will be working in south africa .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed and more than one chinese citizen has been injured in south africa . the chinese people 's world has shown great concern for this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations with the south african side on this issue , and reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security precau@@ tions , and to strengthen unity and love among overseas chinese and the police to work together to crack down on criminal activities .
we would like to express our sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the family members of the victims .
he said that he was very sor@@ ry for this , and asked the chinese people to believe that the south african government is now seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of a chinese woman named chen jian@@ qing , who was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
police are now looking for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the number of hong kong businessmen suspected of shooting in hong kong was arrested by south african police in january this year , and the victim 's property was recovered .
on the possibility of a chinese citizen 's ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , he said that the incident was indeed a major event for the two countries .
the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , n@@ ak@@ a@@ yev , said that the embassy had provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists to south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position on the largest trade partner of africa in 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7@@ 27 - billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism sector believe that the continuous occurrence of the chinese citizens ' murder incident in 2004 has clearly affected the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
currently , there are 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the number of villages in south africa is around 200,000 .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is widening , the unemployment rate is high , the fire@@ arms are spreading , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death , so the rate of crime remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies , and this is more pr@@ one to become the target of criminal off@@ enses in seeking money for attacks .

du@@ an , february 17 ( xinhua ) the news analysis of the dispatch of the li@@ thu@@ anian issue is likely to be un@@ certain
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has ordered to make a statement that the time for the winter olympics was un@@ covered by the athletes using stimul@@ ant , they might face the fate of the go@@ ds , but now they are all looking at the situation from all sorts of situations . this is not very likely to happen in the first time at this winter olympics .
the winter olympics in tur@@ in was opened on 16 august . the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the olympic games , the au@@ st@@ av@@ a was found using a drug - free card .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that it had sent a le@@ af to the winter olympic games , and she had won the winter olympics two gold med@@ als , 15 kilometers of the gold med@@ al , for the women 's 15 - km personal cards she obtained at this winter olympic games .
the two international winter gi@@ ft alli@@ ances made a statement on the same day on the issue of the two - year arms race for the race .
the i@@ oc has been making it clear that athletes who have been un@@ covered in the olympic games will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the competition , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of d@@ oping agents to take a physical test .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold a meeting in accordance with the italian law during this winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the i@@ oc , italy has been making a four - day concession before the opening of the winter olympic games , pled@@ ging that police will not enter the olympic village to search for athletes during the winter games , but the drug - borne athletes will still be accepted by italian procuratorial organs .
it was reported that the italian government supervis@@ ed the du@@ ling winter olympics officials , per@@ k@@ r@@ at , had already sent a le@@ v@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to the du@@ ph@@ in prosecu@@ tors .
however , the i@@ oc and per@@ ve@@ z have not confirmed this matter .
the russian team is in good shape , and the russian team is in a good position to play a key role in the world .
he has worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , a chinese sports official , believes that once a ci@@ a sent back to china , this matter will eventually be out of the mark .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been fighting against d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and there has been no thorough settlement of the issue even though italian procuratorial organs have indeed been involved in this matter , it is hard to say that the result is too good .
according to previous italian athletes using d@@ oping in their country , the penalty is that the banned person has the most severe punishment .
therefore , senior italian security adviser p@@ el@@ e@@ el@@ li said that the release of le@@ v@@ a to j@@ ail was very likely to be a m@@ ere form@@ ality , and most of them were fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could hold a trial , italian police could not even go abroad to send a law@@ yer to return to the country to take a sentence .
if a le@@ v@@ d refused to accept the ruling , the italian side would not have to take her .
