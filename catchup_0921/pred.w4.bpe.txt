what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the united states has been the first country to make a report to congress on the fiscal year 2007 .
if the things are added to the plan for the military action in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the us government 's specul@@ ation that the threat of a other country reflects the fact that the pentagon has consistently created an enemy 's style , and its real purpose is to win more national defense expenses and to create a favorable environment for the us arms industry .
experts say that the huge military spending of the united states is not much less important than that of the united states .
he has been involved in many military experts and scholars who have participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper . he said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased , but the proportion of the state 's fiscal expenditure has been on the whole showing a decline .
official statistics show that the total volume of exports in 2004 was $ 2@@ 8.@@ 6 billion compared with 1979 , up 2@@ 4.@@ 7 percent from the same period last year .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 65 - billion yuan , up 2@@ 4.@@ 6 percent from the previous year , and the national defense spending was only about $ 2@@ 4.@@ 6 - billion , equivalent to about one - third of the us military spending . the per capita military spending was about one - third of the us military spending .
the area of land in the united states and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who is the military force going beyond the normal defense needs ? this is an in@@ dispu@@ table fact .
" the government has been actively promoting the development of the industry , " said mr p@@ ang .
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will continue to maintain military superiority .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says : china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has no way of doing things in the past or in the future , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other countries , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor li ji@@ feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively advance the strategic partnership between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

china : hamas to form cabinet to break through
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas is seeking a breakthrough in forming a cabinet to break through
xinhua news agency reporter wang ha@@ o@@ huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative committee , how to draw a new government blueprint has become the focus of attention in the world at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue directly aff@@ ects the peace process in the next step of the relevant policy orientation .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up their consultations and conducting consultations on the formation of a cabinet , which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the premier 's position has fl@@ owed , and which family has spent ?
hamas has won the power to form a cabinet , and people outside have worried that hamas 's death might be related to the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , the visiting hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ab@@ b@@ as stressed that the organization of palestine 's new government would not recognize israel , which is the hard@@ line signal that has aggrav@@ ated the international community 's anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that has the actual power and threatened to dis@@ solve economic aid to palestine and to transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making a flexible policy adjustment , and it is not easy to elect an independent person .
it is reported that in order to maxim@@ ize international recognition , the egyptian government has recently gathered in egypt 's domestic and foreign leaders to elect independent people , s@@ ab@@ ah , the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , to serve as new prime minister .
this move has not been endorsed by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hus@@ se@@ in , said that regardless of the cost of the prime minister 's position , the most important thing is that the candidate for the prime minister should try his best to des@@ cen@@ d hamas ' hard - line east color , and only thus can it guarantee the success of forming the cabinet .
the power is distributed in a certain way .
in terms of internal affairs , the most important task facing the hamas cabinet is to lack sufficient experience in governing .
the palestinian newspaper " z@@ an@@ z@@ ib@@ ar " analyzed in an article that hamas has gathered people to gather in the capital through social welfare projects , but lacks experience in governing , and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governing , and is the best way to cooperate .
after the election , hamas proposed a new political order with fat@@ ah , which is a political partner , and jointly formed a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
the situation in fat@@ ah is still very grim at present , and there are no one who advocates taking part in the new government , and the other is rej@@ ecting hamas 's invitation , and is willing to hold a referendum on whether to join the new government .
the source pointed out : under the advice of ab@@ b@@ as , the fat@@ ah has gradually become a new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah also will be able to reach a consensus on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is to form a framework for the legislative affairs commission to break away from the party aff@@ iliation .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert government , but it is not yet clear about the specific list .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government has no choice but to form a cabinet that can reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the new legislative council will be elected on 16 february . the nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet will be completed within three weeks and five weeks .
the armed forces are do@@ omed to failure : the chinese people are still facing the task of following the path of armed force .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed problem in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces management .
the hamas 's political and economic reforms are not the only way to achieve the goal of achieving a balanced and balanced development of the economy .
hamas once proposed that the armed forces of all factions be re@@ unified as the people 's army that is under the state of national power , but it has not received any extensive response . it has also been criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ad ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations that are lo@@ ose , and some other factions , such as al@@ ex@@ and@@ er marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades , ta@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , and so on .
the hamas , which is in charge of forming the cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in charge of each side , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the power of safe management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is deliberately in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense organizations , and other organizations , while ab@@ b@@ as is under the charge of the internal affairs department of the new government .
however , the parties are still discussing this sensitive issue , and so far no progress has been made .
