chinese expert : us ' military threat ' is groundless
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to support the development of the us economy , said li liping , director of the us department of defense , here today
experts believe that this is a serious challenge to china 's normal national defense construction , and it exaggerates china 's military threat , which is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three chapters in the report on china 's military strength and the response that the united states should take . the report has directly mentioned 15 times that china has a combined or a perpetrated military force in china .
the world military research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences ( cass ) said that although senior us officials had repeatedly expressed similar views before , this was the first time that the united states had been raising its own defense strategy in its report on national defense strategy , and that china was the most likely to pose military challenges to the united states .
this report clearly for the first time has brought russia 's border into china as a newly emerging strategic opponent , especially the so - called military threat from china , to more countries .
peng guangqian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is noteworthy that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted on the same day , us president bush also submitted a draft budget for fiscal 2007 to the congress , including the national defense budget reaching $ 439.3 - billion .
if , plus , in order to conduct military operations in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guangqian said : the us conjectures and fabrication of the threat of other countries reflect the pentagon 's consistent style of manufacturing enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to make a huge contribution to the us arms industry .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in military experts ' written on many occasions in china 's national defense white paper , said that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national defense spending , which accounts for the same period , is on the whole , is on the decline .
official data show that comparing 2004 with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for 39.3 percent of the national financial expenditures for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense spending was 244.656 - billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states , and its per capita military spending was only about one - 60 percent of that of the united states , and the average military spending per capita was about one - thirds of the us military .
the us territory and china 's territory are generally quite similar , and military spending is so big that the us is in the same size .
peng guangqian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jianqun , said that the us side should objectively evaluate china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their opponents militarily in the future .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any hope in the past and in the future , nor would it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .

hamas sets up cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang hao
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislature , how to draw up the blueprint of the new government into the focus of international attention at present .
what new policies will hamas carry out to the effect of the peace process directly affected the relevant parties ' corresponding policy orientation for the next step .
meanwhile , the boycott of the united states and israel has added variables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are intensifying consultations to reach a consensus on the issues of the future development of the situation and the sensitive point in the formation of the cabinet .
the prime minister 's post will cost the family
after hamas won the right to form a cabinet , people outside the world are worried that the top hamas prime minister might have differences with the current leader abbas .
moreover , the hamas leader , who is currently visiting egypt , has stressed that the palestinian new government formed by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal is also aggravating the international situation of concern .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has the real power and would threaten to cut off economic aid to palestine and to transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is not easy to select an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to select an independent person to the board of directors of the islamic grand school , al-jaafari , to serve as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that whether prime minister 's office is a little over the past , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down hamas 's tough color , and only by so doing can it guarantee the success of the organization .
how should the distribution of power be carried out ?
within the party , the most serious challenge facing the cabinet of hamas is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian daily said in an analysis that hamas has been able to win the support of the people through social welfare projects , but in the aspect of its ruling , it lacks experience and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has the experience in ruling .
hamas proposed a new round of talks with fatah 's political partners , to jointly set up a national coalition government , but fatah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there are some people in fatah who have different views on whether to join the cabinet or not , and they have also advocated taking part in the new government , and the other faction has refused the invitation of hamas , and are willing to do a positive opposition in the legislature .
the informed source pointed out that under abbas 's advice , fatah gradually inclined to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold a meeting on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative committee framework to separate the party from the cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a full - colour expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technical experts - type government has also lost its role as a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative yuan will hold a meeting with the prime minister and form a cabinet after the new legislative council was inaugurated on 16 june .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and reject its participation in politics .
hamas leader mahmoud al-assad stressed on 9 june that armed resistance is a key factor in the organization 's decision to pull out its own way .
the issue of armed forces actually includes the legality of weapons and the two - dimensional management of the armed forces .
the hamas - led government , which has been elected as the first largest party in the legislature through democratic and free means , has made its subordinate armed forces even legalized .
hamas once proposed that all parties be united as a palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it did not receive a wide response , and it was also strongly opposed by the palestinian islamic jihad organization ( jaad ) .
palestine now has 60,000 security personnel , most of whom come from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah also has some loose and loose armed factions . for example , al-aqsa martyrs ' brigades have their own clay of the magic eagle of the martyr al-assad .
hamas , which is in charge of forming a cabinet , must hold talks with abbas on how to manage the armed forces of these various political parties and reasonably distribute the security management power .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police , and civil defense organizations , while the new government 's central ministry of internal affairs will be managed by abbas .
however , the parties are still discussing this sensitive issue , and so far no further progress has been made .

in 1997 , china became a member of the committee of the arctic science committee and won the right to speak and make decisions on international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 years or so , china 's polar investigation has been out of nothing and has developed continuously , and its initial scale has already formed a third - line station , a ship - shaped , a ship - like southern pole scientific observation system , that is , the antarctic longcheng station established in february 1985 , the antarctic zhongshan station established in february 1989 , and the northern antarctic station established in july 2004 , and
statistics from the " report " show that by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 national antarctic scientific surveys , two of which were based on the snowflakes , which were carried on the platform , to inspect the bipolar science of the arctic , two of which were approved for inspection . up to now , more than 3,000 personnel have visited the northern pole of the country to inspect the area .
now we are making preparations for the establishment of the third antarctic observation station , and also the first antarctic inland inspection station in china . the mosul station is doing feasibility study work .
sun zhihui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar survey undertaking has been playing an important role in the world 's polar observation . however , compared with other major polar research projects , china has still made a fairly big gap .
he said .
sun zhihui said that china will publish an annual report on polar research in the future .

japanese researchers develop new - type highly efficient kidney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the east china sea university research institute of japan developed a biological human - to - kidney kidney , which not only has the same rival as human kidney
according to the nihon industrial news , the new biological man - made kidney that has been developed has mainly been composed of two parts , and part of the kidney - class kidney that has been filtered from blood , as well as the water - submachine - building magnetic - shaped leather , and the part is derived from the original urric and genic acid that has returned to blood .
the kidney - class , the kidney - rod , and the urine tubes of the man - made wire are made into the cells of the middle - of - the - sky , the urine of the man 's corn , and the inner side of the corrosion are also covered with the urine tubes with the functions of decommissioning .
this stem cell can make many blood samples of diseases , which have caused the blood penetration , and can make a penetrating analysis of the corrosion of the products of the gene of amino acid and return to the blood , and at the same time it can make the most of the world 's most essential glucose cells into the blood .
the past method of relying on leakage of kidney - building by man - made kidney was different from that of filtering waste , and it could not completely remove it , and it was not capable of removing the function of acid and other elements into blood .
the researchers used the sheep to carry out the experiments of transplanting kidney by biological men , the middle sky walls of human kidney , and the pig cells in the middle sky .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the man - made kidney had already been able to function .
at present , they are developing and using biological human kidney cell , and will be able to verify their safety and to set up clinical research .
china 's power production safety still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state administration of power supervision and management ( sdrc ) said on the 13th that although the overall situation of safe production in electric power in 2005 remains stable , the production safety of power industry is still facing a severe challenge .
wang zhongyu , vice chairman of the state power supervision commission , said at a news conference held here that the fifth meeting of the national power safety production safety committee ( enlarged ) that in 2005 , china 's power production safety was stable on the whole , and that it had successfully completed the task of providing electricity for the summer festival , thus realizing a safe supply and an aggressive emergency response , and basically ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system , and the sharp reduction of power production equipment and
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the large number of new power generating units entering into operation one after another , the production safety of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional use of electricity in seasonal seasons will still exist , and in some regions , the situation of supply and demand of electricity is still relatively tight , and because the benign mechanism for electricity prices has not yet taken shape , there is still a fairly big problem in the supply of electricity . meanwhile , the problem of coal production quality has not been effectively controlled , and the stable operation of power generating units will be seriously affected .
shi yubo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - seated contradictions will be continually exposed . how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the work of safe production of electric power in 2006 , shi yubo said that it is necessary to further solidify the basic work of the management of safe production of electricity , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of power supply , enhance the ability to cope with emergencies , strengthen coordination and cooperation in the power sector , and continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the safe building of the dam and the building of an information - based

in 2005 , china 's total electricity consumption reached 24.689 trillion kilowatt - hours , up 13.455 percent over the same period last year .

south african envoy to china says south africa does not have any organizational constraints against chinese citizens ' criminal acts
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to support the south african government 's efforts to promote the development of the south african economy , said chinese foreign ministry spokesman kong quan here thursday
he also said that the south african government would do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
fu kangning said that the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero and hope that every south african citizen who works in south africa will have a better life and property safety .
since 2006 , four of the chinese nationals have been arrested in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side and has reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of safety and prevention . the overseas chinese have strengthened unity and friendship and cooperated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
let 's express the most sincere sympathy and sorrow to the family of the victims .
fu kangning said that we are sorry for this and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the case of chen jianqing , a chinese woman in fujian , who was in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hunting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the south african businessman who was suspected of guning and killing hong kong businessmen was arrested by the south african police and the property of the victims was recovered .
speaking of the possible negative impact of the chinese citizen 's assassination , fu kangning said that these incidents would indeed affect the development of trade between the two countries and other fields .
according to the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy had only opened a new train of food and clothing to more than 2,000 chinese people in the first 15 days of this year .
according to china 's official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner of china in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7270 million , an increase of 230 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' assassination in 2004 has a noticeable impact on the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to statistics released by the south african tourism bureau , in the first half of 2005 , chinese tourists to south africa were 2031 , a decrease of 14.9 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , chinese living in south africa are about 200,000 people , and the city and countryside in south africa are all in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the unchecked spread of guns , and the threat of death penalty have not been maintained , and the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , there is cash in their possession and their home , and it is more likely to become the target of criminal elements ' pursuit of money .
