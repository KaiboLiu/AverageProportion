re@@ connecting with the very american ideal that labor rights are human rights
cong@@ res@@ sm@@ en ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is have proposed legislation to protect union organiz@@ ing as a civil right .
&quot; as go unions , so go mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class jobs , &quot; says el@@ lis@@ on , the min@@ n@@ es@@ ot@@ a democr@@ at who serves as a cong@@ res@@ sional progressive cau@@ c@@ us co-@@ chair .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m proud to introduce the employee em@@ power@@ ment act with civil rights icon john le@@ w@@ is .
this gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organiz@@ ing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stop@@ ping anti-@@ union forces in their tracks
amending the national labor relations act to allow workers who face discrimination for eng@@ aging in union organiz@@ ing to su@@ e for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compens@@ atory and p@@ uni@@ tive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative .
but it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by american standards .
indeed , the best way to understand what el@@ lis@@ on , le@@ w@@ is and the co@@ spon@@ sors of their legislation are proposing is as a re@@ connection with a very american idea .
despite the bat@@ tering that unions have taken in recent years - in wis@@ con@@ s@@ in , mic@@ hi@@ gan and states across the country - americans once encouraged countries around the world to embr@@ ace , extend and respect labor rights .
there was a time , within the living memory of millions of americans , when this country champi@@ oned democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize in the same bre@@ ath .
when the united states occupied japan after world war ii , general dou@@ gl@@ as mac@@ ar@@ th@@ ur and his ai@@ des encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that hi@@ de@@ ki to@@ jo &apos;s milit@@ ari@@ zed auto@@ cr@@ acy would be replaced with democracy .
fully aware that workers and their unions had a role to play in sha@@ ping the new japan , they included language that explicitly recognized that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to bar@@ gain and act collec@@ tively is guaranteed . &quot;
when the united states occupied germany after world war ii , general d@@ wi@@ ght david e@@ is@@ en@@ ho@@ wer and his ai@@ des ur@@ ged the german@@ s to write a constitution that would assure that ad@@ ol@@ f hit@@ ler &apos;s fas@@ c@@ ism was replaced with mus@@ cu@@ lar democracy .
recogn@@ izing that workers would need to organize and make their vo@@ ices heard in the new nation , the german@@ s included a provision that explicitly declared : &quot; the right to form associations to safeguard and improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed to every individual and to every occupation or profes@@ sion .
agreements that restrict or seek to im@@ pair this right shall be n@@ ul@@ l and vo@@ id ; measures directed to this end shall be un@@ law@@ ful .
when former first lady ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t ch@@ ai@@ red the international commission on human rights , which drafted the universal declaration of human rights that would in 194@@ 8 be adopted by the united nations as a global co@@ ven@@ ant , roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t and the draf@@ ters included a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests . &quot;
for generations , americans accepted the basic pre@@ mise that labor rights are human rights .
when this country coun@@ sel@@ ed other countries on how to for@@ ge civil and democratic societies , americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bar@@ gaining as an equal partner with corpor@@ ations and government agencies - had to be protected .
now , with those rights under as@@ sa@@ ult in america , it is wise , indeed , to recomm@@ it to the american ideal that working people must have a right to organize and to make their vo@@ ices heard in a free and open society .
as the reve@@ ren@@ d martin lu@@ ther king j@@ r. said fif@@ ty years ago :
history is a great teacher .
now everyone knows that the labor movement did not di@@ min@@ ish the strength of the nation but enlarged it .
by raising the living standards of millions , labor mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously created a market for industry and lif@@ ted the whole nation to un@@ dre@@ amed of levels of production .
those who attack labor forget these simple tru@@ ths , but history re@@ members them .
history re@@ members , as should we .
the formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protec@@ tions to prevent discrimination against labor organiz@@ ing - is long over@@ due .
ke@@ ith el@@ lis@@ on and john le@@ w@@ is are renew@@ ing ide@@ als that have histor@@ ically enlarged america and made real the promise of democracy .
judge tempor@@ arily blocks law that could close all lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana abor@@ tion clin@@ ics
a u.s. federal judge on sunday tempor@@ arily bloc@@ ked enforcement of a lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana law that ad@@ voca@@ tes say would likely have closed all five abor@@ tion clin@@ ics in the state .
the measure , signed into law by lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana govern@@ or bo@@ b@@ by j@@ in@@ dal in june and due to take effect se@@ pt . 1 , would require doctors who perform abor@@ tions to have patient ad@@ mitting privile@@ ges at a hospital within 30 miles of their practice .
however , the judge &apos;s ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abor@@ tions while seeking such privile@@ ges .
&quot; pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs will be allowed to operate law@@ fully while continuing their efforts to obtain privile@@ ges , &quot; federal judge john de@@ gra@@ vel@@ les wrote in the decision .
a hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law .
abor@@ tion rights activi@@ sts appla@@ u@@ ded the decision , the latest in a string of rul@@ ings against similar measures , saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privile@@ ges .
&quot; today &apos;s ruling ensures lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana women are safe from an under@@ handed law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights , &quot; said n@@ ancy nor@@ th@@ up , president and chief executive of the center for re@@ productive rights , which su@@ ed to block the law on behalf of three of the state &apos;s five clin@@ ics .
it was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clin@@ ics who were not pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs in the suit and have also applied for ad@@ mitting privile@@ ges .
lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws , with courts recently ruling un@@ constitutional such measures in al@@ ab@@ ama and missi@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
key parts of a tex@@ as law that would have shut@@ tered most remaining clin@@ ics in that state were bloc@@ ked by a federal judge on friday .
abor@@ tion rights campaign@@ ers , along with the american college of ob@@ ste@@ tr@@ ici@@ ans and gy@@ nec@@ o@@ logi@@ sts and the american medical association , say ad@@ mitting privile@@ ges laws impose medic@@ ally unnecessary requirements on doctors .
anti-@@ abor@@ tion ad@@ voca@@ tes have coun@@ tered that the measures aim to protect women &apos;s health , though some have also lau@@ ded their effect of shut@@ tering clin@@ ics .
only one doctor who per@@ forms abor@@ tions in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana has hospital ad@@ mitting privile@@ ges , the center for re@@ productive rights said .
if all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abor@@ tions , that doctor , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his safety , would stop carrying out the procedure , the group said .
in argu@@ ing against the ruling , lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana officials said they would not pun@@ ish doctors performing abor@@ tions while their applications for ad@@ mitting privile@@ ges were pending .
dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and in@@ ability to access best treatment mean o@@ vari@@ an cancer k@@ ills more in rural areas
angel@@ ina jo@@ lie and her brother james have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2007 .
women living in rural australia are at higher risk of dying from o@@ vari@@ an cancer than their city counter@@ parts .
researchers analy@@ sed medical records of more than 1@@ 100 austr@@ ali@@ an women diagno@@ sed with o@@ vari@@ an cancer in 2005 , finding just 35 per cent lived for five years after diagno@@ sis .
lead resear@@ cher sus@@ an j@@ ord@@ an , of the q@@ im@@ r ber@@ g@@ ho@@ fer medical research institute , said those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
small study : new drugs may slow l@@ ung , o@@ vari@@ an cancer
the researchers tr@@ acked the women &apos;s medical jour@@ ne@@ ys across seven years .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said a woman &apos;s age at the time of diagno@@ sis , o@@ vari@@ an cancer type , having existing ill@@ nesses and socio-@@ economic status also imp@@ acted on survival chan@@ ces .
older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagno@@ sis had the poorest survival rates .
those living in regional and remote areas of the state were about 20 per cent more likely to die during the study than those in urban areas .
although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from o@@ vari@@ an cancer , dr j@@ ord@@ an suggested dela@@ yed diagno@@ sis and in@@ ability to access best treatment might be factors .
&quot; this disease is best treated by gy@@ na@@ ecological on@@ co@@ logy sur@@ ge@@ ons and they &apos;re mostly based in major cities , &quot; she said .
despite improving tele@@ -@@ medicine services to less@@ en the ty@@ ran@@ ny of distance , she suggested more fl@@ y-@@ in , fl@@ y-@@ out services to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people in treatment away from their communities could help .
dr j@@ ord@@ an said regardless of geographical status , the study found long-term survival among women with o@@ vari@@ an cancer was poor , rein@@ forcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies .
the research , funded by the rio t@@ into ride to con@@ qu@@ er cancer , will be published today in the medical journal of australia .
in march 2012 , at 33 years of age , young gold coast mum el@@ ish@@ a ne@@ a@@ ve was told that she had an aggres@@ sive form of o@@ vari@@ an cancer .
garden centres r@@ ue fall in home@@ owners
the drop , cou@@ pled with a particular decline in the number of home@@ owners aged under 35 , could result in garden centres losing out on tens of millions of p@@ ounds a year when today &apos;s young consumers reach the &quot; core gar@@ d@@ ening age group , &quot; according to the h@@ ta &apos;s study , which was reported by the financial times .
according to the report , people ren@@ ting properties spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that those with their own homes spend on their gardens .
it ci@@ ted the rise in people living in highly ur@@ ban@@ ised areas with no gardens , the popul@@ arity of pav@@ ing over front gardens for parking and shr@@ in@@ king garden size as other factors threat@@ ening the industry , which is worth an estimated £ 5 billion in sales each year .
greater london , where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years , has britain &apos;s lowest spend per household on gar@@ d@@ ening products .
the h@@ ta and royal hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural society said that ren@@ ting property or a lack of garden space did not mean people could not grow plants .
gu@@ y bar@@ ter , chief hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural advis@@ er to the rh@@ s , said : &quot; contain@@ er gar@@ d@@ ening , for example , is especially popular with ren@@ ters who can move their plants when they re@@ locate . &quot;
the h@@ ta report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the garden retail sector &apos;s &apos; golden age &quot; as a result of increased home ownership and economic prosperity from the late 198@@ 0s to mid-@@ 199@@ 0s .
it also predic@@ ted an improved market this year due to better weather following un@@ favourable conditions in march and april last year .

first day of spring marked with we@@ t and blu@@ ster@@ y conditions imp@@ acting ade@@ la@@ ide airport flights
spring has sp@@ run@@ g a win@@ try surprise on southern south australia , bringing heavy sho@@ wers and strong win@@ ds that have affected flights at ade@@ la@@ ide airport .
a further 5@@ mm of rain fell on the city in the evening up to 9@@ pm , following the 6.@@ 6@@ mm that fell over@@ night on sunday .
the latest rain came cour@@ te@@ sy of a couple of short , blu@@ ster@@ y sho@@ wers , including a bur@@ st that started just before 8@@ pm that dump@@ ed almost 4@@ mm in about 10 minutes .
after winter delivered an early do@@ se of spring last week , temperatures dro@@ pped again on monday to a high of just 15@@ .@@ 8@@ c in the city .
the squ@@ ally conditions are believed to have contributed to the dela@@ yed lan@@ ding of a vir@@ gin airlines flight from mel@@ bour@@ ne to ade@@ la@@ ide .
the plane was scheduled to land just after 7.@@ 30@@ pm but was hit by wind@@ she@@ ar - a su@@ dden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to pul@@ l out .
wind gu@@ sts were reaching about 50@@ km / h on the ground at ade@@ la@@ ide airport at the time .
flight data showed the plane had to pul@@ l out of second lan@@ ding and the plane eventually touched down about 8.@@ 40@@ p@@ m.
that flight &apos;s delay caused the subsequent delay of a few other flights , including an em@@ i@@ rates flight from du@@ ba@@ i and a q@@ ant@@ as flight from sy@@ d@@ ney .

mat@@ th@@ ies thin@@ ks : high time for the internet of things
faced with run@@ away adv@@ ances in consumer technology , which thre@@ aten to turn our homes into high-@@ tech control rooms , our re@@ porter , ber@@ nd mat@@ th@@ ies , takes heart from one electronic g@@ ad@@ get that he really feels at home with .
as i write this , my eye cat@@ ches the spir@@ al cable , which connec@@ ts the hand@@ set to the telephone , and i &apos;m thinking : wo@@ w ! how re@@ tr@@ o is that then ?
but it started me thinking : if the cable was not there , all the hand@@ sets would be lying sc@@ at@@ tered around the house in no time at all - and that would be even more re@@ tr@@ o .
in any case , in the ele@@ ph@@ ant@@ ine ( ele@@ ph@@ ant@@ ine ?
no - a ty@@ ping error - electronics ) sector , the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rub@@ b@@ ish tomorrow - once bought , it &apos;s out of date .
and anyone , for example , who still has an old cr@@ t tv in their living room , is merely announ@@ cing to the world that they &apos;re not interested in t@@ vs !
so why these thoughts ?
because the international consumer electronics fair ( i@@ fa ) in berlin , once again showed us how in@@ competent we are when it comes to questions about technology .
the lay@@ man , who once knew , blind , how to operate a washing machine and a c@@ d-@@ player , is today faced with high@@ f@@ alu@@ tin expert talk about an array of g@@ ad@@ gets , the purpose of which he doesn &apos;t even understand . &quot; connected home , we@@ arab@@ les , health care and urban technologies , &quot; are what the press office promise us .
yes - and ?
what do you say to people , who clearly talk such gu@@ ff volun@@ tar@@ ily ?
really , they &apos;ve been trying to sell us the internet of things for our homes , for the last 20 years .
so that your yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t can place itself on your shopping list ; so that your fi@@ re-@@ alarm can tell you - when you &apos;re lying on the beach in the mal@@ di@@ ves - that there &apos;s a fire in your study back home .
and w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be wonderful if we could set our home air-@@ conditioning to switch on just before we get back from the office ... ?
yes - but that pre@@ sup@@ poses that you have an air-@@ condi@@ tion@@ er in the first place .
however , one dream really will come true very soon : we lift our w@@ ris@@ t wat@@ ches , and in a l@@ oud voice say &quot; vacu@@ um ! &quot; - and at home the vacu@@ um clean@@ er robo@@ t begins to ho@@ over .
fantastic .
everything is ge@@ ared to nothing less than a revolution : &quot; the b@@ ound@@ ary between white and brown goods is becoming bl@@ ur@@ red , &quot; mu@@ t@@ ters an industry in@@ sid@@ er. you can connect your washing machine to your head@@ phone ; your steam o@@ ven can send you a weather report ; and your dat@@ a-@@ go@@ gg@@ les can tell you how long your piz@@ za still has to go in the o@@ ven - but that &apos;s of little use if you &apos;re sitting in a traffic j@@ am .
from everyday experience , we also know : if you need a new model g@@ ad@@ get to urgently work , the battery will almost certainly be empty .
which is another reason why the spir@@ al cable on the telephone will out@@ -@@ live the next i@@ fa exhi@@ bits in berlin .
israeli children return to school after gaza war
thousands of israeli children in areas near the gaza strip went back to school monday after spending the summer in bom@@ b shel@@ ters as ro@@ c@@ kets and mort@@ ars ra@@ ined on their communities during the 50@@ -@@ day israel@@ -@@ hamas war , while schools in gaza remained shut@@ tered as the territory reco@@ vered from the fighting .
the start of school brought a sense of joy and ex@@ ci@@ tement to ro@@ c@@ ke@@ t-@@ scar@@ red communities in southern israel , but the signs of the fighting remained fresh .
in the southern city of ash@@ do@@ d , employees at the &quot; pas@@ ho@@ sh &quot; kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , which was struck by a ro@@ cket , removed sh@@ rap@@ nel marks off the walls and sli@@ des ahead of the students &apos; arrival .
&quot; we are a little s@@ ca@@ red but we are ex@@ ci@@ ted , &quot; said ron@@ it b@@ art , a resid@@ ent of ki@@ b@@ but@@ z sa@@ ad and an english teacher in its school .
a lot of children in our area really need to go back to a rout@@ ine .
her 1@@ 1-@@ year-@@ old daughter , sh@@ ani b@@ art , said it felt a &quot; little bit we@@ ir@@ d &quot; to suddenly be going back to school .
&quot; there were some difficult times and we didn &apos;t leave our houses at all , &quot; she said .
president re@@ u@@ ven ri@@ v@@ lin visited the ki@@ b@@ but@@ z , which is located close to the gaza border , to offer his support .
until a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire hal@@ ted the war last week , thousands of residents of border communities like sa@@ ad remained in@@ doors or left their homes for sa@@ fer areas further away from gaza to escape ro@@ cket and mor@@ tar fire .
many residents of na@@ h@@ al o@@ z , a community close to the gaza fronti@@ er where a 4-@@ year-@@ old boy was killed by a palestinian mor@@ tar shell , are hesit@@ ant about coming back .
the education ministry said about a do@@ zen families still had not returned .
their children have been placed in alter@@ n@@ ate schools for the time being .
prime minister ben@@ jam@@ in net@@ any@@ ah@@ u visited a school in s@@ der@@ ot , a gaza border town that has been hard hit by palestinian fire .
he ur@@ ged the children to study hard and said &quot; we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security . &quot;
israel and hamas agreed to an open-@@ ended tru@@ ce last tuesday .
the ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues un@@ resolved , such as hamas &apos; demand for the lif@@ ting of an israel@@ -@@ egyp@@ tian bloc@@ k@@ ade of gaza and the re@@ opening of gaza &apos;s air and sea@@ ports .
israel wants hamas to dis@@ arm and the return of bodies of two israeli soldiers killed in the war .
a new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in egypt .
the war killed more than 2,@@ 100 palestinians , three-@@ quarters of whom were civili@@ ans and at least 4@@ 94 children , according to palestinian and u.@@ n@@ . estimates .
israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were milit@@ ants , though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims .
on the israeli side , 66 soldiers and six civili@@ ans , including a th@@ ai work@@ er , were killed .
hamas and other gaza milit@@ ants fi@@ red 4@@ ,@@ 5@@ 91 ro@@ c@@ kets and mort@@ ars at israeli cities during the fighting , mostly in the south .
the israeli military , meanwhile , carried out more than 5@@ ,000 air@@ stri@@ kes and other attacks .
the israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in gaza , and an estimated 2@@ 50@@ ,000 people took refu@@ ge in more than 100 u.@@ n@@ . schools turned into ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft shel@@ ters .
with tens of thousands of people still in the shel@@ ters and fighting still r@@ aging , education officials dela@@ yed the start of the school year last week .
&quot; i hope the school will open soon to complete our education , just like the world &apos;s children and jewish children , &quot; said mo@@ ham@@ ma@@ d am@@ ara , a 13@@ -@@ year-@@ old boy staying in a gaza city school .
following the election in sa@@ x@@ ony : c@@ du vice-@@ chairman stro@@ b@@ l questions n@@ p@@ d-@@ ban@@ ning process
in view of the loss of votes by the german right-@@ wing extre@@ mis@@ t party , n@@ p@@ d , in sa@@ x@@ ony , the national c@@ du@@ -@@ vice-@@ chairman , thomas stro@@ b@@ l , has called for an end of the on-@@ going n@@ p@@ d-@@ ban@@ ning process , which is taking place in the german federal constitutional court .
berlin - according to c@@ du national vice-@@ chairman , thomas stro@@ b@@ l , the current trial taking place in the german federal constitutional court to decide whether to ban the n@@ p@@ d from the political process , should be brought to an end .
according to the &quot; le@@ ip@@ zi@@ ger vol@@ k@@ s@@ ze@@ it@@ ung , &quot; the n@@ p@@ d performed worse than last time , &quot; said stro@@ b@@ l , who is also c@@ du regional bo@@ ss in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg .
that is a good development , one that should make us happy , and this trend leads me to think that we should fight the n@@ p@@ d in the bal@@ lot box , and not in the constitutional court .
on sunday , the n@@ p@@ d nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly missed achieving the five percent barri@@ er , which would have seen it enter parliament .
a first attempt at secur@@ ing a ban of the right-@@ wing extre@@ mis@@ t party failed in 2003 , because the federal office for the protection of the constitution also had in@@ for@@ man@@ ts in the top ec@@ hel@@ ons of the n@@ p@@ d .
in december 2013 the bun@@ des@@ r@@ at submitted a further ban@@ ning action to the constitutional court , which is based in kar@@ ls@@ ru@@ he , after spending a long time preparing the case .
the german government and bun@@ de@@ sta@@ g did not take part in the ban@@ ning sub@@ mission .
har@@ burg : t@@ ents for new refugees
refugees at ne@@ ul@@ än@@ der platz will now be accommo@@ dated in t@@ ents .
the reception centre for refugees in har@@ burg is full-@@ to-@@ bur@@ sting .
the german internal affairs authority has now given the go@@ -@@ ahead for the red cross to e@@ rec@@ t the three t@@ ents .
the local area politicians were only informed about it a short while before - and they are not happy .
&quot; these one-@@ off actions only sti@@ r up more doubts in the minds of the public , and they give the local politicians no chance to work out a constructive plan of how to house refugees in a human@@ e manner , &quot; said , for example , brit@@ ta her@@ r@@ mann , chair@@ woman of the green party in the har@@ burg district assembly .
her party is calling on the har@@ burg district authority to deplo@@ y empty houses to accommodate the refugees .
96 refugees can be accommo@@ dated in the three t@@ ents .
the reasons for the over-@@ crow@@ ding in the initial reception centres are mainly the su@@ dden increase in numbers of those seeking help , as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation .
many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months .
housing prices have posted their strong@@ est winter gain in seven years , according to a wi@@ del@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched gau@@ ge .
the r@@ p data co@@ re@@ logic he@@ don@@ ic home value index of austr@@ ali@@ an capital city d@@ wel@@ ling prices rose by 1.@@ 1 per cent in august , r@@ p data said on monday .
the rise brought the total gain over the june , july and august to 4.@@ 2 per cent , the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007 .
annual growth in prices came in at 10.@@ 9 per cent , more than double the gain of the 12 months to august 2013 , but the gains were not even@@ ly spread across the country .
r@@ p data research director ti@@ m law@@ less said sy@@ d@@ ney and mel@@ bour@@ ne are driving a two ti@@ er market .
the r@@ p data figures show sy@@ d@@ ney home prices rose by 16@@ .@@ 1 per cent in the past year , while mel@@ bour@@ ne &apos;s were up by 11.@@ 7 per cent .
the next strong@@ est markets were ade@@ la@@ ide , br@@ is@@ ban@@ e and dar@@ win , with price rises a@@ ver@@ aging between five and six per cent .
at the other end of the scale was can@@ ber@@ ra , hit by government spending cu@@ t@@ backs , where prices rose by only 1.@@ 4 per cent through the year .
mr law@@ less said that now spring has begun there would be a rise in listings of properties for sale over the coming few months , which would be a &quot; real test &quot; for the market .
&quot; considering the ongoing high rate of au@@ ction clear@@ ance rates , a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment , it &apos;s likely that d@@ wel@@ ling values will rise even further over the next three months , &quot; he said .
in an announcement to the regional german newspaper &apos; die ne@@ ue pres@@ se &apos; p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l contradic@@ ted the comments of managing director , pe@@ er med@@ au , and said that the latter was be@@ having like a &quot; military general . &quot;
this was not the style of the college , he said .
he said that the med@@ au family &quot; were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of june .
they are simply wrong to say that they only learned of the plans in july &quot; .
at the same time he also said that the plans were not about &quot; final decisions already made , &quot; but rather about &quot; st@@ ating preferences &quot; .
he also said that the building work to wi@@ den the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the med@@ aus fe@@ ared .
it was not - and will not be - a matter of a nine me@@ tre@@ -@@ wide road .
we currently aim to wi@@ den it by 5.@@ 5 metres , which is one metr@@ e wider than before , &quot; explained p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l .
p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l refu@@ tes the argument of the med@@ au concern , namely that its cost-@@ free parking places which belong to the school , will in future only be available for use by the college students .
it won &apos;t be a case of everywhere being par@@ ked up , because we have time to find intelligent solutions , as has been the case with other car parks , too .
think of the neighbours
the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y ber@@ g@@ w@@ ich@@ tel , which is situated on the space in question , and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run , is &quot; not to be imp@@ acted &quot; according to the college president .
he is far more concerned to point out &quot; that it &apos;s not only an issue concerning the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y , rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stras@@ se and the 800 scho@@ ol@@ children of the ad@@ jac@@ ent secondary school .
it &apos;s therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the med@@ au gentlemen , &quot; he said .
whether the criticism by the parents &apos; association for the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y is correct that the extension of the road will lead to &quot; one of the few remaining natural spaces in co@@ burg being lost , &quot; he said the &quot; read@@ ers can decide for themselves . &quot;
at the beginning of october , p@@ ö@@ tz@@ l , together with the b@@ am@@ berg regional building authority , plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 &quot; and to talk about the importance of the extension work in this context . &quot;
pe@@ er med@@ au informed the parents of the children &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y about the plans , last week .
accordingly , the access for the new parking level will not now lead , as before , via the camp@@ us and fried@@ rich@@ -@@ stre@@ ib@@ -@@ stras@@ se , but rather via the med@@ au@@ -@@ berg .
thus , the narrow road must be wi@@ den@@ ed into two lan@@ es over a stre@@ tch of about one kil@@ ome@@ tre .
according to higher estimates of the med@@ aus , the traffic in the ho@@ hen@@ f@@ els castle park would increase ten@@ -@@ fold .
they are talking of 2000 vehicles every day .
meanwhile , the town council refused to comment .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f reti@@ res from german national hand@@ ball team
hol@@ ger gl@@ and@@ or@@ f will no longer play for the german national team .
the 31 year-@@ old from german bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a side s@@ g fl@@ ens@@ bur@@ g-@@ han@@ de@@ wit@@ t said that it was mainly for health reasons that he had reached this decision .
&quot; it was not an easy decision to make , but i &apos;ve been thinking about it for months .
the time has come to listen to the signals my body sen@@ ds and to end my national team career , &quot; announced the 2007 world cup winner on his fac@@ e@@ boo@@ k-@@ page .
he reti@@ res from international competition with a record of 16@@ 7 national games and 5@@ 76 goals for germany .
the power@@ ful@@ -@@ thro@@ wing right-@@ back wants to continue for the next few years to sho@@ ot goals for the champion@@ s-@@ league winners from fl@@ ens@@ burg , and will therefore not be available for selection by new german national team head co@@ ach , d@@ ag@@ ur si@@ gur@@ ds@@ son .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f said he had had a &quot; nice long talk &quot; with the ic@@ el@@ ander , who will select his squ@@ ad on tuesday for the games against switzerland .
his ideas and approach to the game have always inspired me , as i am sure they will also in@@ sp@@ ire my long-term te@@ am@@ mates and my success@@ ors , too .
&quot; i would like to represent my club in the next few years and i need longer breaks and more recovery time to do so , and the double burden of also playing for the national team w@@ oul@@ d@@ n@@ `@@ t allow me to do that . &quot;
the lef@@ t-@@ han@@ der fe@@ ared his career might end in 2012 when he had a he@@ el inf@@ ection .
due to ach@@ ill@@ es tend@@ on problems he was given a cor@@ tis@@ one injec@@ tion by doctors working with the german hand@@ ball association , and this caused severe s@@ wel@@ ling of his foot .
he needed an emergency operation and two further sur@@ ger@@ ies as well .
gl@@ and@@ or@@ f then brought a legal action against the team doctor ; however , this ended in a settlement .
twelve years as a professional and ele@@ ven years with the national team would take their tol@@ l on any player .
&quot; i have some health issues i can &apos;t ignore any@@ more .
after three foot@@ -@@ sur@@ ger@@ ies within a short period of time in 2012 , caused by inf@@ ec@@ tions , i have never been able to control my blood pressure .
i &apos;ve also got some other minor issues related - wear and te@@ ar .
at the beginning of the year i realized that i was able to control my head , but i cou@@ l@@ d@@ n@@ `@@ t play tr@@ ic@@ ks with my body , &quot; he explained in an interview with german magazine hand@@ ball time .
he would only consider a com@@ e@@ back if really necessary .
&quot; if we are in real big trouble , then i might consider it , &quot; the two-@@ time father told the magazine .
&quot; but i can count the years i will continue to play hand@@ ball with one hand .
and i have to admit that i have become really hum@@ ble after my long stay in the hospital in 2012 , when it comes to my health .
after my career i would like to walk straight , to be honest . &quot;
besides the 2007 world championship he also won the champi@@ ons league in may and the e@@ h@@ f-@@ cup in 2008 ( h@@ s@@ g n@@ ord@@ hor@@ n ) and 2010 ( t@@ b@@ v le@@ m@@ go ) .
he also won the cup winners cup with fl@@ ens@@ burg in 2012 .
german economy as sh@@ run@@ k by 0.@@ 2 percent in spring
the crises around the globe have put a cur@@ b on the german economy in the the second quarter .
the gross domestic product san@@ k from april to the end of june 20@@ 14 by 0.@@ 2 percent in comparison with the previous quarter .
this was announced by the german office for national statistics , which thereby confirmed previous estimates .
consumption alone was a sp@@ ur to the economy in the early part of the year , whilst investments were down .
foreign goods trade had slow@@ ed , too .
due to the strong start to the year , figures for first half-@@ year gdp were up 0.@@ 8 percent from the second quarter of 2013 .
hor@@ st@@ mar was the starting point and the destination of &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land@@ -@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; , which lead through the city on sunday .
the city of hor@@ st@@ mar experienced an inv@@ asion of dutch &quot; fi@@ et@@ zen ri@@ ders &quot; on sunday .
the largest cycling federation in hol@@ land , n@@ t@@ f@@ u , st@@ aged the so-called &quot; m@@ ün@@ ster@@ lan@@ de-@@ mo@@ o@@ i@@ ste &quot; .
in other words , the largest bike ride straight through m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , a bike ri@@ der &apos;s paradise close to hol@@ land .
by regi@@ stering , more than 1000 participants than@@ ked jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne for having organized this tour through m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land .
the tour was adver@@ ti@@ sed in several professional journ@@ als , and offered to those interested .
we are from den hel@@ der , and dro@@ ve here over night so we could take part in the tour .
we would also like to get know m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land a bit better in the same way &quot; , the cy@@ cli@@ sts e@@ ag@@ erly said , looking forward to the route through ste@@ in@@ furt , bor@@ ken and co@@ es@@ fel@@ d .
after regi@@ stering at the fr@@ at@@ ern@@ ity &apos;s club house , sta .
k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina started off with a small &quot; peace ride &quot; through the city and over the em@@ bank@@ ment , which is also where the start line was .
then , the route , which was adver@@ ti@@ sed in three different categories , head@@ ed in the direction of her@@ ren@@ hol@@ z via sch@@ ö@@ pp@@ inger berg towards co@@ es@@ fel@@ d , passing by ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k , and then back to hor@@ st@@ mar .
the ri@@ ders prove just how good a shape they are in : stret@@ ches of 95 kilometers at an al@@ titude of 1@@ 17@@ 5 meters , 120 kilometers with an al@@ titude of 14@@ 75 meters , and 14@@ 5 kilometers with an al@@ titude of 17@@ 75 meters .
they were fed and wa@@ tered on their way back in ha@@ vi@@ x@@ bec@@ k and b@@ ill@@ er@@ bec@@ k .
chief organiz@@ er , jo@@ s ter hu@@ er@@ ne , and depu@@ ty may@@ or , he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing seemed to be very pleased with the success of this cycling event .
we are happy , and it was a wonderful experience for all participants .
the organization went smo@@ o@@ thly , with no issues , and there were no na@@ sty inci@@ dents &quot; , he@@ in@@ z l@@ ö@@ l@@ fing posi@@ tively concluded with regard to the event .
unfortunately , there were not as many participants as the organiz@@ er had hoped for , which is pre@@ sum@@ ably because of the bad weather forec@@ ast and the morning rain .
&quot; we shall see each other in 20@@ 15 , hopefully with nice weather , on either 30 august , or on another weekend &quot; , the ri@@ ders promised , but whatever the weather , they will return to m@@ ün@@ ster@@ land , and the organiz@@ ers will plan a repeat .
kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker - scr@@ up@@ ul@@ ously honest mem@@ o@@ irs
the 28@@ 7-@@ page &quot; mon@@ k and war@@ ri@@ or &quot; by kon@@ stan@@ tin w@@ ec@@ ker , song writer , paci@@ f@@ ist , political acti@@ vis@@ t and ex@@ -@@ prison@@ er , is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a bio@@ graphy
composed more as a collection of th@@ ough@@ t-@@ pro@@ vo@@ king ideas rather than a chron@@ ological history , the author , who was born in munich on 1 june 194@@ 7 , has provided every chapter with an accompan@@ ying suitable song@@ -@@ text .
and he has been un@@ st@@ int@@ ingly honest throughout : from ma@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ating as a gram@@ mar school pu@@ p@@ il to sho@@ p@@ lif@@ ting and dru@@ g-@@ taking , he has left none of his human weak@@ nesses un@@ told .
and this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so toler@@ ant towards his fellow man .
as a result , ab@@ str@@ act concepts , which he liber@@ ally uses throughout the text , take on a clearer , more important meaning : love ; soul ; e@@ go ; existing in the here and now ; spirit@@ u@@ ality - he seeks to understand the essential meaning of these concepts , in a highly philosoph@@ ical , but also very personal way .
and he explains why he is paci@@ f@@ ist ; what lies behind his criticism of society ; his political heart and soul ; and also how his thoughts and ideas have been shaped and mou@@ l@@ ded - not only by music ( he was an opera lo@@ ver who became a soul and rock musici@@ an ) but by his prison experience , too .
he says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the mon@@ ks , who live their lives by a process of &quot; sub@@ tr@@ action &quot; whereby they &quot; rid themselves of all things su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
in-@@ between all the high@@ bro@@ w stuff , there are also short an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes of a more ear@@ thy nature - for example , fi@@ st-@@ fi@@ ghts in a bar frequ@@ ented by g@@ is , or else a cra@@ zy drive on the motorway , in which he dro@@ ve full-@@ on straight into a tree .
and he &apos;s un@@ spar@@ ing also , as he describes that too .
len@@ ny hen@@ ry : my father never hu@@ gged me .
never said &quot; i love you &quot;
hen@@ ry was one of seven children born to jam@@ a@@ ic@@ an immigrants in du@@ d@@ ley in the mid@@ lands in 195@@ 8 .
his father , who died when hen@@ ry was 19 , worked in a factory and their relationship was limited .
hen@@ ry is re@@ hear@@ sing a com@@ edy , ru@@ dy &apos;s rare records , which is based in part on an imag@@ inary con@@ vers@@ ation with his father and has grown out of the radio 4 series .
the sound@@ track is a mix of reg@@ ga@@ e and ra@@ p and the tun@@ es are up@@ beat .
but hen@@ ry has had to work through some difficult mem@@ ories of child@@ hood .
there was &quot; a lot &quot; of therapy after his mother died and hen@@ ry is refl@@ ec@@ tive about his relationship with his father .
he was very un@@ kno@@ w@@ able .
you never saw his face , you just heard his voice : &apos; stop the noise .
leave your si@@ ster alone .
move !
i want to watch the cr@@ ick@@ et .
my older bro@@ thers se@@ y@@ m@@ our and hil@@ ton - who were gro@@ wn@@ -up when i was a k@@ id - went to the pu@@ b with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass , the beauty of the stro@@ ke in cr@@ ick@@ et .
i never had a con@@ vers@@ ation with him like that .
he was this un@@ s@@ mil@@ ing blo@@ ke in the corner , reading the paper for a lot of my life .
recently hen@@ ry opened a foun@@ dry in du@@ d@@ ley and , although conditions were better than in his father &apos;s day , he got a sn@@ ap@@ shot of what life must have been like for him .
it &apos;s a bit bri@@ ghter now but they &apos;re dark , smo@@ ky , sty@@ gian lab@@ y@@ r@@ in@@ th@@ ine dep@@ ths with bur@@ sts of fl@@ ame and smo@@ ke and lots of so@@ ot .
my dad used to get in the bath and just lie there and you &apos;d hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would w@@ ash the foun@@ dry off him .
when i wal@@ ked round it , i re@@ alised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table , and my es@@ tim@@ ation of him went up .
none the less , hen@@ ry emerged from a child@@ hood stri@@ pped of paren@@ tal aff@@ ection .
my dad never did hu@@ gging , never said , &apos; i love you &apos; .
it was@@ n &apos;t until my mum was po@@ or@@ ly near the end of her life that we started saying &apos; i love you , i love you , i love you .
having a daughter of his own , bil@@ lie , with da@@ wn french , enabled him to share the love he missed as a child .
could you stop with the &quot; i love you &quot; ?
just stop hu@@ gging me !
dad , i &apos;m 22 !
with da@@ wn french .
why w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t i be friends with her ?
she &apos;s a great mum
he &apos;s still very good friends with french , to whom he was married for 25 years .
da@@ wn &apos;s a good person .
why w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t i be friends with da@@ wn ?
she &apos;s a great mum .
hen@@ ry &apos;s own mother was di@@ abe@@ tic .
it was one of the things that killed her .
so when i became very , very over@@ weight and started getting di@@ abe@@ tic symp@@ t@@ oms , my doctor said , &apos; you &apos;ve got to be radical .
so i went on a big fitness thing , and i also had to go on a dr@@ astic di@@ et to reverse the symp@@ t@@ oms .
it &apos;s very hard .
and it &apos;s te@@ di@@ ous .
nobody li@@ kes eating car@@ ro@@ ts .
hen@@ ry &apos;s change in career tra@@ jec@@ tory is , perhaps , reflected in his distinguished , clo@@ se@@ -@@ cro@@ pped be@@ ard .
since he won critical acc@@ la@@ im for his o@@ th@@ ell@@ o , he has become eng@@ ros@@ sed in the theatre .
com@@ edy of errors followed , as did f@@ ences by august wil@@ son .
it &apos;s a different experience from the sit@@ com@@ s and com@@ e@@ dies that have up@@ hol@@ ste@@ red his busy working life .
he started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory .
a d@@ j spo@@ t@@ ted him on stage doing impres@@ sions and wrote to new faces about him .
his tv career was launched in the mid-@@ se@@ ven@@ ties : &quot; for quite a long time i was the only black impres@@ sion@@ ist / com@@ edi@@ an on tel@@ ly . &quot;
he lear@@ nt on the job .
not only did i have to grow up in the public eye , i had to learn how to be an efficient jo@@ ke@@ -@@ deli@@ vering mechanism between 197@@ 5 and 198@@ 5 , whilst being a star , being on television and it was really difficult .
len@@ ny on new faces in 197@@ 5
because his manager owned the stage rights to the black and white min@@ stre@@ l show , a light entertainment programme in which people &quot; black@@ ed up , &quot; hen@@ ry found himself performing his com@@ edy in it for five years .
my family were very un@@ comfortable about it .
i sort of wish it had never happened , but i don &apos;t regret that i did it .
although it was a we@@ ir@@ d , re@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible position to be in , i was working in huge ven@@ ues and learning how to work a crow@@ d .
but what was an &quot; awar@@ d-@@ winning light entertainment st@@ ap@@ le of british television for years and years &quot; was also a &quot; gro@@ te@@ s@@ que par@@ o@@ dy of black people . &quot;
introducing characters who both lam@@ po@@ oned and celebrated black british culture , hen@@ ry worked on the alternative com@@ edy circuit in the eigh@@ ties .
the first series of the len@@ ny hen@@ ry show ai@@ red in 198@@ 4 , and in the n@@ ine@@ ties he was known as , among other things , ch@@ ef gare@@ th black@@ lock in the com@@ edy series ch@@ ef ! .
advertis@@ ements , docum@@ ent@@ aries , tv series and parts in films consum@@ ed his next decade but after his 2008 bb@@ c series , len@@ ny@@ hen@@ ry@@ .@@ tv , he thought : &quot; what are you going to do next , len , because it all feels a bit like you &apos;re marking time or you &apos;re slightly going si@@ de@@ ways . &quot;
what came next was a radio 4 docum@@ entary series called what &apos;s so great about ... ?
the first was on sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i had a real aller@@ gy to sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are .
i was@@ n &apos;t really taught it at school properly and thought it was very much the reserve of mid@@ d@@ le-@@ class white people with ti@@ ghts and a cab@@ b@@ age down the front .
so i was very fri@@ ghten@@ ed of it .
everybody we inter@@ viewed on that show , peter hall , tre@@ v@@ or n@@ un@@ n , adri@@ an les@@ ter , ju@@ di den@@ ch , said , &apos; you should try it .
don &apos;t sla@@ g it off if you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
get some of the words in your mouth and then you &apos;ll understand why we all love sha@@ kes@@ pe@@ are so much .
hen@@ ry delivered 20 lines of o@@ th@@ ell@@ o &apos;s last speech for the docum@@ entary and he was ho@@ o@@ ked .
it gave me the feeling that i could do it .
it &apos;s almost like i had my head put on straight for me .
&apos;@@ this is what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s a serious thing , take it seriously , learn your lines , do some research .
so the re@@ hear@@ s@@ al process was brut@@ al and i was reading that play for months and months before we did it .
and it was a success .
they seemed to expect a car cr@@ ash and it didn &apos;t quite happen .
soon he was star@@ ring in com@@ edy of errors .
suddenly i &apos;m at the national theatre and i just cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t quite believe it .
there was one moment where i thought , &apos; o@@ h , you &apos;ve changed . &quot; &quot;
there was a technical fault and hen@@ ry inst@@ inc@@ tively felt that it was his job to keep the audience enter@@ tained .
&quot; a little voice inside me said , &apos; you &apos;re going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer . &quot; &quot;
instead , the stage manager announced the performance would re@@ sume as soon as the problem was resolved .
i wal@@ ked off the stage and something in me went , &quot; o@@ h , thank god &quot; .
it &apos;s not my responsibility .
i can let some@@ body else sort it out .
&apos;@@ you &apos;re in a play , stay in character . &quot; &quot;
hen@@ ry appe@@ aring in f@@ ences at the du@@ ch@@ ess theatre
learning his lines for f@@ ences was challenging .
pan@@ ic &apos;s quite good , it sti@@ ff@@ ens the sin@@ e@@ ws .
that was well received too , so it &apos;s like a big sign from the go@@ ds , saying , &apos; this is what you should be doing . &quot; &quot;
he says this , of course , in a bo@@ om@@ ing voice .
so i &apos;m stic@@ king with it .
i &apos;m really lo@@ ving it .
i love being in a re@@ hear@@ s@@ al room .
hen@@ ry still has a com@@ edi@@ an &apos;s brain , though - throughout , our con@@ vers@@ ation is broken with fl@@ ash@@ es of his hum@@ our as he sli@@ ps in and out of impres@@ sions .
i &apos;m just choosing not to do stand@@ -up because that thing of getting inst@@ ant gra@@ ti@@ fication from a room full of str@@ ang@@ ers i gu@@ ess is kind of dangerous .
if you &apos;re constantly seeking that it can lead to a br@@ ick wall .
i do live at the apo@@ llo sometimes when i want to , but generally it doesn &apos;t flo@@ at my boat like it used to .
i ask whether he &apos;ll ever do another stand@@ -up tour .
the joy of sitting in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning , middle and end of a journey - i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever want to give that up .
so this is his new inc@@ ar@@ nation ?
i think so .
i like being an actor .
it &apos;s good fun .
you &apos;re always telling a story and that &apos;s a great place to be .
i love stories .
people love stories .

&quot; this exercise will contribute significantly to the ra@@ tion@@ alization of the public service by determin@@ ing the actual numbers of public serv@@ ants and will also be used to clean@@ se the pay@@ roll at both levels of govern@@ ment@@ - hence bring a stop to the issue of &apos; g@@ host workers &apos; , &quot; said anne wai@@ gur@@ u , the cab@@ in@@ et secretary in the ministry of dev@@ olution and planning .
the scand@@ al surrounding arts advis@@ or , hel@@ ge ach@@ en@@ bach , will be heard for the first time in court on 11 november .
five he@@ irs of ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht , the son of the founder of al@@ di , the@@ o al@@ bre@@ cht , are su@@ ing ach@@ en@@ bach and two of his companies , who are in the process of declar@@ ing themselves bank@@ ru@@ pt , for 19@@ .@@ 4 million euros compensation in a civil case brought before the d@@ üs@@ sel@@ dorf district court .
the news was announced by a court spo@@ kes@@ woman on monday .
according to the statement of claim , when purchasing the works of art and anti@@ que cars , ach@@ en@@ bach con@@ ned them , and invo@@ ic@@ ed ber@@ th@@ old al@@ bre@@ cht for more than the actual sales price .
in so doing , the agreed commission also turned out to be more .
ach@@ en@@ bach purchased valu@@ ables for al@@ bre@@ cht for 12@@ 1 million euros .
children need roots and w@@ ings
he was a school teacher for 44 years , 23 of which he was the principal .
during his teaching time , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter got to know many scho@@ ol@@ children who are now ful@@ ly-@@ grown adults living in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en and k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach .
his methods were sometimes un@@ conventional , but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child .
mount sn@@ ě@@ ž@@ ka is one of the be@@ st-@@ known pe@@ aks in the czech giant mountains .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter lo@@ ves this painting of a picture from his child@@ hood home .
rich@@ ter was born in 19@@ 30 in tr@@ au@@ ten@@ au / n@@ ord@@ b@@ ö@@ h@@ men , today &apos;s tr@@ ut@@ no@@ v .
he was interested in becoming a teacher as early as the age of 14 , after he had been a secondary school pu@@ p@@ il for four years .
one year later the german@@ s living in the su@@ de@@ ten@@ land were dispos@@ s@@ essed .
within half an hour , the family had to leave their home .
after a few months spent in a holding camp , they moved to bav@@ aria in 194@@ 6 - in a goods train .
that was how he came to live in sen@@ k@@ endor@@ f , in upper fran@@ con@@ ia .
the teacher training course was in b@@ am@@ berg .
in order to get to the school , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter had to go six times per week on foot to the ne@@ arest train station ; take the train to b@@ am@@ berg ; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school ; and then make the return journey home .
after two mon@@ th@@ s. man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter was given a bed to sleep at the red cross home in b@@ am@@ berg , in a sle@@ eping quarter that he shared with 15 fellow students .
in 195@@ 1 , he took his first state ex@@ am , and his second in 195@@ 4 , after spending three further years as a teaching candidate .
since upper fran@@ con@@ ia had no free teaching place for him , he applied to upper bav@@ aria and received a post on 1 november 195@@ 4 at a school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach .
the &quot; young women &apos;s room &quot; was his first &quot; service flat &quot; in the school building .
in 195@@ 8 , he moved into the new@@ -@@ build teacher accommodation next door to the school , into a three-@@ room service flat .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter bought this house in 1980 , after the school in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach was closed in 196@@ 8 .
until then , the school district association of pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en-@@ k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach had three classes in k@@ ol@@ l@@ bach and five in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
in the school year of 196@@ 8 / 69 , these classes were accommo@@ dated in pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en , in today &apos;s town hall .
when the in@@ der@@ s@@ dorf schools association was founded , the only school left in the loc@@ ality was the primary school .
in order to avoid a der@@ an@@ king of position in the now smaller school , the then de@@ an , geor@@ g si@@ gl decided to move to kar@@ ls@@ fel@@ d - and man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter became his success@@ or .
however , pe@@ ter@@ sha@@ us@@ en continued to grow , and so the children and their teachers , from september 198@@ 2 on@@ wards , could move into the pres@@ ent-@@ day building , which has since been extended , after rich@@ ter took his reti@@ rement .
man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter pra@@ ises the un@@ complicated manner and spirit of gener@@ os@@ ity of the then may@@ or , lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz , who was able to secure municip@@ al funds to build an additional work@@ -@@ room and extra rooms in the cel@@ lar as part of the 1997 exten@@ sions - although the council guidelines governing scho@@ ol@@ -@@ building work did not allow subsidies to be used to pay for this work .
&quot; may@@ or g@@ ö@@ tz was a great friend of the school , &quot; rec@@ alls rich@@ ter , with gra@@ titude .
throughout his whole career , man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter never for@@ got a reply given in a speech by a government representative , in answer to a presentation given by the schools council on law and justice : &quot; one should never forget to love &quot; . man@@ f@@ red rich@@ ter du@@ ly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher .
&quot; one has to give children two things : roots and w@@ ings , &quot; says the 8@@ 4 year-@@ old .
but experience has also taught him that : &quot; one doesn &apos;t always achieve that . &quot; whether by that he means his pu@@ pil@@ s or his own six children , is un@@ clear .
in any case , rich@@ ter &apos;s methods were at times un@@ conventional .
if school children got into fi@@ ghts , they were not given pun@@ ish@@ ments like , for example , writing out lines or serving a de@@ tention .
at the cost of the council , rich@@ ter bought two pa@@ irs of bo@@ x@@ ing glo@@ ves , and then let the two ant@@ ag@@ oni@@ sts fight it out , even if this did occa@@ sion@@ ally produce a black@@ -@@ eye .
for the benefit of the school , rich@@ ter nur@@ tured a good relationship with the then may@@ or , lu@@ d@@ wi@@ g g@@ ö@@ tz ( c@@ su ) .
following his reti@@ rement , rich@@ ter , who had no political alle@@ gi@@ ances , was encouraged by the may@@ or to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the c@@ su in 1996 .
however , rich@@ ter finished in sixth and joined the c@@ su .
18@@ 0 kilometres in three days
hr@@ 4-@@ cycle tour 700 cy@@ cli@@ sts are taking a bre@@ a@@ ther in the health resort of bad salz@@ haus@@ en and sch@@ ot@@ ten
there is nothing particular out of the ordinary about tour@@ ing cy@@ cli@@ sts take a rest in bad salz@@ haus@@ en or in sch@@ ot@@ ten .
however , on friday , the she@@ er numbers of those re@@ sting up was striking : the 700 participants of the hr@@ 4 cycle tour , together with their ent@@ our@@ ages , were all enjoying a break in the lower resort of bad salz@@ haus@@ en , and they would later be atten@@ ding an open air party in the al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park in sch@@ ot@@ ten , too .
under the logo &quot; cycling and celebr@@ ating along the new@@ ly-@@ discovered routes between ni@@ d@@ da and kin@@ zi@@ g , &quot; the participants had met up on thursday in bad vil@@ bel and had listened to a concert there by van ba@@ ker &amp; band .
on friday it was down to business : the ri@@ ders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via fl@@ or@@ stadt to bad salz@@ haus@@ en and then further on to sch@@ ot@@ ten .
in bad salz@@ haus@@ en , the sport@@ s@@ men@@ -@@ and-@@ women were gre@@ e@@ ted by may@@ or han@@ s-@@ peter s@@ eu@@ m , who had ri@@ dden off the star@@ t-@@ line in bad vil@@ bel on his own bike , and the bo@@ ss of the municip@@ al company bad salz@@ haus@@ en , pe@@ tra sch@@ w@@ ing-@@ d@@ ö@@ ring .
all sor@@ ts of food and drink had been prepared , to refres@@ h body and mind : the local women from ran@@ stadt and ni@@ e@@ der@@ -@@ mo@@ ck@@ stadt had ba@@ ked 85 ap@@ ple@@ - , pl@@ um@@ - and che@@ es@@ ec@@ ak@@ es - as well as stre@@ us@@ el ca@@ ke which the in@@ tre@@ p@@ id ri@@ ders let mel@@ t in their mou@@ ths .
&quot; such ca@@ kes only the local women can make , &quot; p@@ raised the ri@@ der from a@@ ul@@ en@@ di@@ e@@ bach , at the same time as he ordered another s@@ lic@@ e .
at the drinks stand of the ge@@ i@@ ß@@ -@@ ni@@ d@@ da gy@@ m@@ na@@ si@@ um club , the ri@@ ders could acquire cold drinks .
the &quot; du@@ o bra@@ vo &quot; enter@@ tained the visitors with well-known me@@ lo@@ dies from o@@ pe@@ re@@ tt@@ as and musi@@ c@@ als and re@@ ap@@ ed enthusi@@ astic applause .
the lovely atmosphere in the park had a relaxing effect .
one gentle@@ man even received a head@@ -@@ massage from his lady partner : &quot; he certainly earned it - after all , he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off , earlier in the day . &quot;
meanwhile , the may@@ or and the company bo@@ ss still had work to do : they were inter@@ viewed at the foun@@ tain in front of the water@@ ing-@@ hole inn , the tr@@ ink@@ kur@@ haus , by re@@ porter , ra@@ iner jan@@ ke , and took their radio opportunity to give a big thum@@ bs up for bad salz@@ haus@@ en .
even head of promo@@ tions , to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen , who had worked as tour head since it first started in 2004 , could only get a short rest , as he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology .
his pic@@ k-@@ up tr@@ uck , in which he used three tele@@ phones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15@@ -@@ strong h@@ ess@@ en police team ; made fac@@ e@@ book entries and also wrote his reports , also needed a check .
&quot; the majority of ri@@ ders come from the rhe@@ in-@@ main@@ -@@ region , &quot; he explained , &quot; but ri@@ ders have also come from gi@@ e@@ ß@@ en and ful@@ da , from lau@@ ter@@ bach or from the ta@@ un@@ us and even from many towns in west@@ f@@ alia .
the number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay .
category 1 ri@@ ders are accommo@@ dated in hotels , with category 2 ri@@ ders being put up in hoste@@ l-@@ style lod@@ ging .
as the ri@@ ders set out again on the road , they had a good impression and happy mem@@ ories of the resort : &quot; b@@ ye ! &quot;
&quot; it was very nice in bad salz@@ haus@@ en ! &quot; they sh@@ ou@@ ted , as they w@@ av@@ ed good@@ b@@ ye .
after arriving in sch@@ ot@@ ten , the group could take a short rest .
but then in the evening , the ri@@ ders were requested to go to the id@@ yl@@ lic al@@ te@@ bur@@ g@@ park .
under the guidance of manager of the sch@@ ot@@ ten association for tourism and town marketing ( g@@ ts ) the park had acquired a lovely f@@ es@@ tive ambi@@ ence and , of course , there were plenty of nice ni@@ bb@@ les , such as fl@@ am@@ m@@ ku@@ chen with well-@@ ch@@ illed feder@@ wei@@ ß@@ er wine , too .
ma@@ yo@@ ress sus@@ anne sch@@ a@@ ab , gt@@ s-@@ bo@@ ss , mark@@ us ho@@ ß@@ fel@@ d and m@@ sc@@ -@@ chairman , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wag@@ ner@@ -@@ s@@ ach@@ s , in his capacity as board member of the h@@ ess@@ en-@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen section of the ad@@ ac welcomed the visitors .
the three were vi@@ sibly delighted by the &quot; ro@@ aring trade in sch@@ ot@@ ten . &quot;
d@@ j to@@ bi@@ as h@@ agen opened the d@@ ancing stage .
the cy@@ cli@@ sts were happy to have the chance to show off their d@@ ancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting feat@@ s on their bicy@@ cles earlier in the day .
the appeared among the guests an increasing number of local people , who were as attrac@@ ted by the pleasant atmosphere as much as the mass crow@@ d of ri@@ ders .
on the second day of the tour program , the ri@@ ders would call at the stop@@ ping points of bir@@ stein ; w@@ ä@@ ch@@ ter@@ s@@ bach ; and bad or@@ b - including a concert with the tren@@ k@@ wal@@ der@@ n .
yesterday , after 18@@ 0 kilometres of cycling , the sport@@ s@@ men@@ -@@ and-@@ women arrived back in bad vil@@ bel once again .

not all children back to school in ukraine
schools across most of ukraine re@@ opened their doors on monday ( september 1 ) , after the summer holidays .
the day is tradi@@ tionally a big one for families , and like thousands of other ukra@@ inian parents , prime minister ar@@ sen@@ y y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk took his daughter to school .
while there , he told waiting journalists that not all schools had re@@ opened , but that he was committed to defending the country for future generations :
the first of september cere@@ mony was not held in every school .
there is not a peaceful sky over every part of ukraine .
we must fight for a peaceful sky .
the whole of ukraine , a huge joint ukra@@ inian &apos;s people &apos;s front , must fight for a peaceful sky .
ale@@ k@@ san pa@@ stu@@ k@@ ho@@ v , the head teacher of sla@@ vi@@ ans@@ k school , attended by y@@ at@@ sen@@ y@@ uk &apos;s daughter , spoke in russian .
we hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives .
the first day back at school is tradi@@ tionally celebrated by children we@@ aring em@@ bro@@ ide@@ red shir@@ ts , carrying bal@@ lo@@ ons and giving flowers to their teachers .
in r@@ ona fair@@ head , the bb@@ c may have found the form@@ id@@ able chief it needs
she comes tra@@ iling cl@@ ou@@ ds of gl@@ ory from the world of banking , media management and the inner con@@ cla@@ ves of the tory party .
indeed , she has had fron@@ t@@ line experience of her own .
her career began at global management consult@@ ants ba@@ in and co , then progres@@ sed via mor@@ gan stan@@ ley , bom@@ ba@@ di@@ er , ic@@ i and the media world of pe@@ ar@@ s@@ ons .
she was chief executive of the financial times for seven years , re@@ signing when the top job at its parent company pe@@ ar@@ son &apos;s went to a junior male colleague .
her pay@@ -@@ off is said to be close to £ 1 million .
her political rating is st@@ ur@@ dy , too .
she was recommended to david camer@@ on by lord bro@@ wn@@ e , the former head of b@@ p , when he was looking to bring private expertise into wh@@ ite@@ hall : she became a cab@@ in@@ et office advis@@ er .
her hus@@ band is a former tory counc@@ ill@@ or .
back in may , i described the chairman &apos;s job as a po@@ is@@ oned chal@@ ice .
not only is the bb@@ c a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life , but there is an inner par@@ ado@@ x to its structure .
the trust faces in two directions : in@@ wards as the upper ti@@ er of the bb@@ c &apos;s own management hier@@ arch@@ y , but also ou@@ tw@@ ards as the voice of public concern and dis@@ quiet when things go a@@ wr@@ y .
this is an almost un@@ ten@@ able du@@ o@@ po@@ ly calling for complete ro@@ ot@@ -@@ and-@@ branch reform .
but what in@@ coming chairman would risk coming in , cr@@ ash@@ ing around and disman@@ t@@ ling an institution as complex as a chinese dy@@ na@@ sty in case they put themselves out of a job in the process .
it &apos;s a difficult call .
if that we@@ ren &apos;t tough enough , plenty of people are keen to see the bb@@ c cut down in size - its power , its finances and its status over@@ ha@@ ul@@ ed .
as competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certain@@ ties , the im@@ minent negotiation of the licence fee is frau@@ ght with especi@@ al danger for the bb@@ c .
for the modest sum of £ 14@@ 5.@@ 50 a year , the british public bu@@ ys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world .
the bb@@ c tells a good story : it claims that its output reach@@ es 96 per cent of house@@ holds , and costs each one of them just 40@@ p a day .
what &apos;s more , apparently the be@@ e@@ b &apos;s popul@@ arity is rising : 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago .
patterns of watching and using the bb@@ c have changed : i receive news head@@ lines on my mobile phone these days , and catch up on missed programmes with i@@ player .
but it remains a mu@@ ch-@@ loved and form@@ id@@ able institution .
it needs a form@@ id@@ able chairman - i hope it has found one .
tex@@ as &apos; per@@ ry says dispar@@ aging t@@ we@@ et un@@ authorized
a t@@ we@@ et from republic@@ an tex@@ as go@@ v. ric@@ k per@@ ry &apos;s veri@@ fied account on sunday night included a dispar@@ aging image of the democratic district att@@ or@@ ney who is at the center of his criminal indic@@ tment on charges of abuse of power .
the t@@ we@@ et was later deleted , followed by another from per@@ ry &apos;s account that dis@@ avo@@ wed the post .
a t@@ we@@ et just went out from my account that was un@@ authorized .
&quot; i do not con@@ done the t@@ we@@ et and i have taken it down , &quot; the later post said .
per@@ ry ai@@ des did not immediately return messages seeking comment .
although the t@@ wee@@ ts were sent from per@@ ry &apos;s veri@@ fied account , it was un@@ clear who does the actual po@@ sting for the feed .
the earlier t@@ we@@ et posted an un@@ fl@@ at@@ tering mo@@ ck image of trav@@ is county district att@@ or@@ ney ros@@ em@@ ary le@@ h@@ m@@ berg , who was convic@@ ted of dr@@ un@@ ken driving in april 2013 .
per@@ ry ve@@ to@@ ed funds to her office when she refused to resi@@ gn , which led to a grand jury in aus@@ tin this month indic@@ ting per@@ ry - who is a potential 20@@ 16 presidential candidate .
the cap@@ tion on the t@@ we@@ et reads : &quot; i don &apos;t always drive dr@@ un@@ k at 3@@ x the legal blood alcohol limit ... but when i do , i indic@@ t go@@ v. per@@ ry for calling me out about it . &quot;
i am the most dr@@ un@@ k democr@@ at in tex@@ as .
le@@ h@@ m@@ berg &apos;s office did not lead the grand jury investigation against per@@ ry .
it was handled by michael mc@@ cr@@ um , a san ant@@ oni@@ o-@@ based special prosecu@@ tor who was assigned by a republic@@ an judge .
per@@ ry has ple@@ aded not guil@@ ty and called the charges a political p@@ lo@@ y .
his high-@@ powered legal team has asked the judge over@@ seeing the case to dis@@ miss the indic@@ tment , claim@@ ing that the law being used to prosecu@@ te the lon@@ ge@@ st-@@ serving govern@@ or in tex@@ as history is un@@ constitu@@ tionally v@@ ague .
per@@ ry cut off $ 7.@@ 5 million in state funds to the state &apos;s public integrity unit - which is based in trav@@ is county and prosecu@@ tes public corruption in tex@@ as - when le@@ h@@ m@@ berg refused to resi@@ gn .
that ve@@ to dre@@ w a formal compla@@ int from a lef@@ t-@@ le@@ an@@ ing wat@@ ch@@ dog group .
per@@ ry &apos;s veri@@ fied account is updated frequently - and sometimes fam@@ ously .
after finishing in fifth place in the i@@ ow@@ a cau@@ cus@@ es during his 2012 presidential campaign , per@@ ry addressed spec@@ ulation that he might call it qu@@ its with a t@@ we@@ et of a photo of himself jo@@ gging near a lake , and the words , &quot; here we come south car@@ ol@@ ina ! &quot;
ber@@ ke@@ ley says housing market back to &quot; normal &quot;
one of london &apos;s most prominent property developers has war@@ ned that the housing market in sou@@ the@@ ast england has &quot; rever@@ ted &quot; to normal levels of activity .
homes in the capital have been the subject of re@@ d-@@ hot demand and sur@@ ging prices , with widespread fears of a credit bu@@ b@@ ble promp@@ ting the bank of england to impose limits on mort@@ gage bor@@ ro@@ wing in june .
ton@@ y pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley , founder and chairman of up@@ market house@@ buil@@ der ber@@ ke@@ ley , on monday said : &quot; since the start of the current financial year , the market has rever@@ ted to normal transaction levels from the high point in 2013 , &quot; adding that this offered a &quot; stable operating environment . &quot;
london &apos;s property market fa@@ red well during the down@@ turn as foreign bu@@ yers pil@@ ed into the capital .
prices in the city have le@@ ap@@ t 18@@ .@@ 5 per cent in the past year alone , according to land regi@@ stry data , far out@@ stri@@ pping the 6.@@ 7 per cent average for england and wal@@ es as a whole .
average selling prices on ber@@ ke@@ ley &apos;s private , affordable and student schemes have ris@@ en by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 4@@ 23@@ ,000 at the end of april .
however , a strengthening p@@ ound has in recent months made london property less attractive to foreign bu@@ yers - some of whom have also been deter@@ red by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhe@@ tor@@ ic around a potential &quot; man@@ sion tax &quot; ahead of the general election next may .
london estate agent fo@@ x@@ tons last week war@@ ned that april &apos;s mort@@ gage market review , which introduced t@@ ough@@ er l@@ ending rules , would also s@@ park lower rates of market growth in both property sales transactions and prices during the second half of the year .
fresh data from the bank of england on monday showed a drop in the number of mort@@ gage appro@@ vals in july , further sugge@@ sting the housing market is cooling .
h@@ amp@@ tons international , another estate agent , has cut its 20@@ 15 forec@@ ast for london property price growth to 3 per cent on the basis that house price s@@ enti@@ ment is already starting to weak@@ en .
transaction vol@@ umes have meanwhile dro@@ pped by a quarter year on year in london &apos;s most expensive post@@ codes , such as ch@@ el@@ sea , may@@ fair and ken@@ sing@@ ton , according to agent wa ell@@ is .
still , appe@@ ti@@ te for homes in the capital has been a bo@@ on to ber@@ ke@@ ley , pus@@ hing up cash due on forward sales to more than £ 2.@@ 2@@ b@@ n@@ .
mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley added : &quot; demand for the right product with good design in the best locations has remained resi@@ li@@ ent and , refl@@ ecting this , forward sales have been maintained . &quot;
in june the company reported it had sold 3,@@ 7@@ 42 new homes in the year to the end of april - almost a third more than the pre-@@ crisis peak in 2007 .
annual pre-@@ tax profits rose 40 per cent year on year to £ 3@@ 80@@ m , on revenues up 18 per cent to £ 1.@@ 6@@ b@@ n@@ .
speaking on monday ahead of the company &apos;s annual meeting , mr pi@@ d@@ g@@ ley said ber@@ ke@@ ley &apos;s ear@@ nings for the year were anticip@@ ated to be in line with current market expectations .
analy@@ st consensus is for full-@@ year pre-@@ tax profit of £ 4@@ 50@@ m .
ber@@ ke@@ ley shares were flat at £ 2@@ 3.@@ 96 in afternoon london trading .

&quot; it was a popular song by a jazz pi@@ an@@ ist called f@@ ats wall@@ er , &quot; he told her , automatically putting two fing@@ ers to his li@@ ps .
this his father had always done to sti@@ f@@ le the letter j before it left his li@@ ps .
it had begun as a game between them when he was small .
his father had played it with his own father , he &apos;d told him .
begin a word with a j without re@@ member@@ ing to put two fing@@ ers across your mouth and it cost you a pen@@ ny .
it had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now .
he knew it was expected of him , that was all .
he had to explain what jazz was .
ail@@ inn had never heard any .
jazz , too , without exactly being pro@@ scri@@ bed , was@@ n &apos;t played .
impro@@ vis@@ ation had fallen out of fashion .
there was room for only one &quot; if &quot; in life .
people wanted to be sure , when a tun@@ e began , exactly where it was going to end .
w@@ it , the same .
its un@@ predic@@ tability un@@ settled people &apos;s ner@@ ves .
and jazz was w@@ it expressed musi@@ cally .
though he reached the age of 10 without having heard of sam@@ my dav@@ is junior , ke@@ ver@@ n knew of jazz from his father &apos;s semi-@@ secret collection of old c@@ ds .
but at least he didn &apos;t have to tell ail@@ inn that f@@ ats wall@@ er was black .
given her age , she was unlikely to have re@@ mem@@ bered a time when popular sing@@ ers we@@ ren &apos;t black .
again , no laws or du@@ ress .
a compli@@ ant society meant that every section of it consen@@ ted with gra@@ titude - the gra@@ titude of the provi@@ d@@ enti@@ ally spa@@ red - to the principle of group ap@@ titude .
people of a@@ fro@@ -@@ caribbean origin were suited by temper@@ ament and physi@@ que to entertainment and athle@@ tics , and so they san@@ g and spr@@ in@@ ted .
people originally from the indian sub@@ continent , electron@@ ically gi@@ fted as though by nature , under@@ took to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone .
what was left of the polish community pl@@ um@@ bed ; what was left of the greek sm@@ ash@@ ed plates .
those from the gulf states and the lev@@ ant whose grand@@ parents h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t quickly left the country while what happened , if it happened was happening - fe@@ aring they &apos;d be accused of having sto@@ ked the fl@@ ames , fe@@ aring , indeed , that the fl@@ ames would con@@ sume them next - opened lab@@ ne@@ h and sh@@ is@@ ha@@ -@@ pi@@ pe restaurants , kept their heads down , and grew de@@ pressed with id@@ len@@ ess .
to each according to his gi@@ fts .
having heard only b@@ all@@ ads , ail@@ inn was hard pressed to understand how the insul@@ ting words ke@@ ver@@ n had just sung to her could ever have been set to music .
music was the expression of love .
&quot; they &apos;re not really insul@@ ting , &quot; ke@@ ver@@ n said .
except maybe to people whose feet are too big .
my father never insul@@ ted any@@ body , but he delighted in this song .
he was saying too much , but the garden &apos;s negl@@ ect gave the illu@@ sion of safety .
no word could get beyond the sound@@ proof@@ ing of the giant cab@@ bag@@ e-@@ like leaves .
ail@@ inn still didn &apos;t compre@@ h@@ end .
why would your father have loved something like that ?
he wanted to say it was a jo@@ ke , but was re@@ luc@@ t@@ ant , in her company , to put two fing@@ ers to his li@@ ps again .
she already thought he was strange .
&quot; it struck him as fun@@ ny , &quot; he said instead .
she sho@@ ok her head in dis@@ belief , blo@@ tting out ke@@ ver@@ n &apos;s vision .
nothing to see in the whole wide world but her ha@@ y@@ st@@ ack of cro@@ w-@@ black hair .
nothing else he wanted to see .
&quot; if you say so , &quot; she said , un@@ convinced .
but that still doesn &apos;t explain why you &apos;re sing@@ ing it to me .
she seemed in genuine dist@@ ress .
are my feet too big ?
he looked again .
your feet specifically , no .
your an@@ k@@ les , maybe , a bit ...
and you say you h@@ ate me because my an@@ k@@ les are too th@@ ick ?
h@@ ate you ?
of course i don &apos;t h@@ ate you .
that &apos;s just the sil@@ ly song .
he could have said , &quot; i love you , &quot; but it was too soon for that .
&quot; your th@@ ick an@@ k@@ les are the very reason i &apos;m attrac@@ ted to you , &quot; he tried instead .
i &apos;m per@@ verse that way .
it came out wrong .
he had meant it to be fun@@ ny .
meaning to be fun@@ ny often lan@@ ded him in a m@@ ess because , like his father , he l@@ acked the re@@ ass@@ uring charm necessary to temp@@ er the cru@@ el@@ ty that l@@ ur@@ ked in jo@@ kes .
maybe his father intended to be cru@@ el .
maybe he , ke@@ ver@@ n , did .
despite his kind eyes .
ail@@ inn sol@@ om@@ ons fl@@ us@@ hed and rose from her dec@@ k@@ chair , kno@@ cking over the con@@ sole and sp@@ illing the wine they &apos;d been drinking .
el@@ der@@ f@@ lower wine , so drink was@@ n &apos;t his exc@@ use .
in her ag@@ itation she seemed to trem@@ ble , like the fron@@ ds of a pal@@ m tree in a stor@@ m .
&quot; and your th@@ ick head &apos;s the very reason i &apos;m per@@ ver@@ sely attrac@@ ted to you , &quot; she said ...
except that i &apos;m not .
he felt sorry for her , both on account of the unnecessary un@@ kin@@ dness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him .
did she think he &apos;d strike her ?
she h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t spoken to him about life on the ch@@ ill northern archi@@ pel@@ ago where she had grown up , but he didn &apos;t doubt it was in all essenti@@ als similar to here .
the same vast and ic@@ y ocean cr@@ ash@@ ed in on them both .
the same be@@ fu@@ d@@ d@@ led men , even more thin@@ -@@ sk@@ in@@ ned and pe@@ ev@@ ish in the after@@ mat@@ h of what happened than their s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler and w@@ rec@@ ker an@@ ce@@ st@@ ors had been , ro@@ amed an@@ gr@@ ily from pu@@ b to pu@@ b , ready to raise a hand to any woman who d@@ ared to refuse or tw@@ it them .
th@@ ick head ?
they &apos;d show her a th@@ ick f@@ ist , if she was@@ n &apos;t careful !
s@@ no@@ g her first - the s@@ no@@ g having become the most common expression of ero@@ tic ir@@ r@@ itation between men and women ; an anti@@ d@@ ote to the b@@ land b@@ all@@ ads of love the con@@ sole pum@@ ped out - s@@ no@@ g her first and cu@@ ff her later .
an unnecessary re@@ fin@@ ement in ke@@ ver@@ n &apos;s view , since a s@@ no@@ g was itself an act of thu@@ g@@ gery .
ail@@ inn sol@@ om@@ ons made a sign with her body for him to leave .
he heav@@ ed himself out of the dec@@ k@@ chair like an old man .
she felt lea@@ den her@@ self , but the weight of his gri@@ ef surprised her .
this was@@ n &apos;t the end of the world .
they bare@@ ly knew each other .
she wat@@ ched him go - as at an up@@ sta@@ irs window her compan@@ ion wat@@ ched him go - a man made heavy by what he &apos;d brought on himself .
ad@@ am leaving the garden , she thought .
she felt a pan@@ g for him and for men in general , no matter that some had raised their hands to her .
a man turned from her , his back b@@ ent , ash@@ amed , defe@@ ated , all the fight in him le@@ ak@@ ed away - why was that a sight she felt she knew so well , when she cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t recall a single instance , before today , of having seen it ?
alone again , ail@@ inn sol@@ om@@ ons looked at her feet .
a score or so years before the events related above , es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m , an intelligent and enthusi@@ astic 3@@ 2-@@ year-@@ old resear@@ cher employed by of@@ now , the non-@@ stat@@ ut@@ ory monitor of the public mo@@ od , prepared a short paper on the continu@@ ance of low@@ - and medium-@@ level violence in those very areas of the country where its reduction , if not its c@@ ess@@ ation , was most to have been expected , given the money and energy exp@@ ended on u@@ pro@@ oting it .
&quot; much has been done , and much continues to be done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to so@@ o@@ the the native aggres@@ si@@ veness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them , especially in those tw@@ isted k@@ nar@@ ls and narrow cre@@ v@@ ices of the country where , though the spi@@ res of churches so@@ ar above the he@@ d@@ ger@@ o@@ ws , the s@@ wee@@ ter bre@@ ath of human kin@@ dness has , histor@@ ically , been ra@@ rely felt .
but some qualities are pro@@ ving to be iner@@ adic@@ able .
the higher the sp@@ ire , it would seem , the lower the pas@@ sions it goes on eng@@ end@@ ering .
the popul@@ ace wee@@ ps to s@@ enti@@ mental b@@ all@@ ads , gor@@ ges on stories of ad@@ versity overcome , and prof@@ esses to believe ar@@ d@@ ently in the virtu@@ es of marriage and family life , but not only does the old br@@ uti@@ sh@@ ness retain a per@@ tin@@ ac@@ ious hold equally on rural communities as on our urban con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , evidence suggests the emerg@@ ence of a new and v@@ icious quar@@ rel@@ s@@ omen@@ ess in the home , in the work@@ place , on our roads and even on our playing fields .
&quot; you have an unfortunate tend@@ ency to over@@ write , &quot; her supervis@@ or said when he had read the whole report .
may i suggest you read fewer nov@@ els .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m lo@@ wered her head .
i must also en@@ qu@@ ire : are you an a@@ the@@ ist ?
&quot; i believe i am not obliged to say , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied .
are you a les@@ bian ?
again es@@ me pro@@ tested her right to privacy and silence .
a fem@@ in@@ ist ?
silence once more .
&quot; i don &apos;t ask , &quot; lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z said at last , &quot; because i have an objec@@ tion to a@@ the@@ ism , les@@ bi@@ an@@ ism or fem@@ in@@ ism .
this is a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free work@@ place .
we are the serv@@ ants of a pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ e-@@ free society .
but certain kinds of hy@@ pers@@ en@@ si@@ tivity , while entirely acceptable and lau@@ dable in themselves , may sometimes distor@@ t findings such as you have presented to me .
you are obviously yourself pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against the church ; and those things you call &quot; v@@ icious &quot; and &quot; bru@@ tish , &quot; others could as soon interpre@@ t as expres@@ sions of natural vig@@ our and vit@@ ality .
to still be har@@ ping on about what happened , if it happened , as though it happened , if it happened , yesterday , is to sap the country of its essential life force .
es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m looked around her while r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z spoke .
behind his head a fl@@ am@@ ing@@ o pin@@ k led sc@@ roll repeated the advice of@@ now had been dispen@@ sing to the country for the last quarter of a century or more .
sm@@ ile at your neighb@@ our , cher@@ ish your sp@@ ou@@ se , listen to b@@ all@@ ads , go to musi@@ c@@ als , use your telephone , conver@@ se , explain , listen , agree , apo@@ log@@ ise .
talk is better than silence , the sung word is better than the written , but nothing is better than love .
&quot; i fully understand the points you are making , &quot; es@@ me n@@ us@@ s@@ bau@@ m rep@@ lied in a quiet voice , once she was certain her supervis@@ or had finished speaking , &quot; and i am saying no more than that we are not heal@@ ed as effectively as we de@@ lu@@ de ourselves we are .
my concern is that , if we are not fore@@ war@@ ned , we will find ourselves repe@@ ating the mistakes that led to what happened , if it happened , in the first place .
only this time it will not be on others that we v@@ ent our an@@ ger and mi@@ str@@ ust .
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z made a py@@ ram@@ id of his fing@@ ers .
this was to suggest infin@@ ite pati@@ ence .
&quot; you go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; in descri@@ bing as &quot; mistakes &quot; actions which our grand@@ parents might or might not have taken .
you go too far , as well , in speaking of them v@@ enting their &quot; an@@ ger &quot; and &quot; mi@@ str@@ ust &quot; on &quot; others . &quot;
it should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past , as in protecting the present , we do not speak of &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
there was no &quot; we &quot; and there were no &quot; others . &quot;
it was a time of dis@@ order , that is all we know of it .
&quot; in which , if we are honest with ourselves , &quot; es@@ me d@@ ared to inter@@ ject , &quot; no section of society can claim to have acqu@@ it@@ ted itself well .
i make no acc@@ us@@ ations .
whether it was done ill , or done well , what was done was done .
then was then .
no more needs to be said - on this we agree .
and just as there is no blame to be ap@@ por@@ tioned , so there are no am@@ ends to be made , were am@@ ends appropriate and were there any way of making them .
but what is the past for if not to learn from it -
the past exists in order that we forget it .
if i may add one word to that -
lu@@ ther r@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ wit@@ z collap@@ sed his py@@ ram@@ id .
&quot; i will consider your report , &quot; he said , dis@@ missing her .
the next day , turning up for work as usual , she was kno@@ c@@ ked down by a motor@@ cy@@ c@@ list who had mounted the pav@@ ement in what pas@@ ser@@ s-@@ by described as a &quot; v@@ icious r@@ age . &quot;
coinci@@ d@@ ences happen .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military says no cou@@ p planned ; pm stays in south africa
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials denied st@@ aging a cou@@ p to over@@ throw the government , saying they were acting against police susp@@ ected of trying to arm political fan@@ a@@ tics .
prime minister thomas th@@ ab@@ ane f@@ led the country , saying the country &apos;s military had surrounded his official home and se@@ ized government buildings in the capital of mas@@ er@@ u .
the premier took his family to neighbor@@ ing south africa after saying he received an ass@@ ass@@ ination threat .
military spo@@ kes@@ man major n@@ t@@ le@@ le n@@ to@@ i said there was not , in fact , a cou@@ p , but that the military was respon@@ ding to a threat from &quot; political fan@@ a@@ tics &quot; whom police were attemp@@ ting to arm .
&quot; what happened this morning was that the command of the les@@ o@@ th@@ o defense force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service , there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political , party political youth fan@@ a@@ tics who were on the ver@@ ge of w@@ re@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c , &quot; he told voice of america .
south african government spo@@ kes@@ man cla@@ y@@ son mon@@ y@@ ela said the military &apos;s actions had the appearance at an over@@ throw .
&quot; although no one has claimed to have taken over government through the use of force , by all accounts the activities of the les@@ o@@ th@@ o defense force thus far bear the h@@ all@@ marks of a cou@@ p d &apos;@@ et@@ at , &quot; he said .
les@@ o@@ th@@ o military officials said soldiers returned to their bar@@ r@@ acks sunday and there was calm in the capital .
meanwhile , depu@@ ty prime minister mo@@ the@@ t@@ jo@@ a met@@ sing in control of the government in th@@ ab@@ ane &apos;s absence .
th@@ ab@@ ane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country .
ten@@ sions have been high in les@@ o@@ th@@ o since june when th@@ ab@@ ane suspended parliament sessions due to f@@ eu@@ ding in his unity government .
he said his actions have not under@@ min@@ ed the government , despite alleg@@ ations otherwise .
eurozone manufacturing at 13@@ -@@ month low
manufacturing growth in the eurozone slow@@ ed to a 13@@ -@@ month low in august , according to a clo@@ sel@@ y-@@ wat@@ ched survey .
the final mark@@ it &apos;s eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers &apos; index ( p@@ mi ) di@@ pped to 5@@ 0.@@ 7 in august , down from 5@@ 1.@@ 8 in july .
a figure above 50 indicates expansion .
new orders d@@ wind@@ led and fac@@ tories suffered am@@ id rising ten@@ sions between the eu and russia over ukraine .
the figures come ahead of the european central bank ( ecb ) meeting on thursday .
markets will be looking for a clear plan from the bank to deal with a st@@ alled eurozone recovery , as well as the threat of de@@ fl@@ ation with inflation standing at just 0.@@ 3 % .
there is spec@@ ulation that ecb bo@@ ss mari@@ o drag@@ hi could offer further indic@@ ations later this week that he is considering a quanti@@ tative eas@@ ing scheme for the eurozone , similar to those taken by the uk and us during the financial crisis .
&quot; although some growth is better than no growth at all , the bra@@ king effect of rising economic and geo@@ political un@@ certain@@ ties on manufacturers is becoming more visible , &quot; said ro@@ b do@@ b@@ son , senior econom@@ ist at mark@@ it .
the factory p@@ mi for germany , russia &apos;s biggest trade partner in the eu , fell to an 1@@ 1-@@ month low of 5@@ 1.@@ 4 .
meanwhile , in the blo@@ c &apos;s secon@@ d-@@ largest economy , france , the p@@ mi fell to 4@@ 6.@@ 9 .
france remains a real concern , as does italy &apos;s des@@ cent from solid expansion to stag@@ nation .
signs that growth impe@@ tus wan@@ ed in the key industrial engine of germany , and in spain and the netherlands too , is also less than re@@ ass@@ uring , &quot; mr do@@ b@@ son said .
the slow@@ down in industry is likely to add further fuel to the fire for analy@@ sts expec@@ ting additional monetary or fiscal stimul@@ us to be implemented .
one positive note was from the republic of ireland , which saw its p@@ mi grow to 5@@ 7.@@ 3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 .
ho@@ ward ar@@ cher , chief econom@@ ist at i@@ h@@ s global insight , said : &quot; the best that can be said for the august eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers &apos; survey is that it indicates that the sector is still growing . &quot;
he added : &quot; eurozone manufacturers are clearly finding life very difficult at the moment as current hei@@ ghten@@ ed geo@@ political ten@@ sions - particularly related to russia / ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries .
this hei@@ ghten@@ ed uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially , and consumer confidence , and it is likely causing some orders to be dela@@ yed or even cancelled , particularly bi@@ g-@@ ticket orders .
he said it was looking &quot; ever more likely &quot; that the ecb would ultimately have to undertake some form of q@@ e , &quot; although we susp@@ ect that it will be limited . &quot;
the bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ ors &apos; decade of hel@@ l : ten years since the hor@@ ri@@ fic school sie@@ ge , how the children caught up in it are still suffering
ten years ago over 1@@ ,000 people were taken ho@@ stage by chec@@ hen milit@@ ants at a school in bes@@ lan , southern russia
more than 3@@ 30 people , more than half of them children , were killed in the three-@@ day or@@ deal that sho@@ c@@ ked the world
we went back to bes@@ lan to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room at@@ ro@@ city
exactly a decade after the app@@ alling bes@@ lan school sie@@ ge in which 3@@ 34 per@@ ished , including 18@@ 6 children , the her@@ o@@ ic survi@@ v@@ ors war@@ ned last night of a new apo@@ c@@ aly@@ pse in ukraine .
when fan@@ atic islamic terrorists kid@@ n@@ app@@ ed and killed children and parents on 1 september 2004 , at the start of a new term , it seemed like the na@@ di@@ r of all evil .
the tragedy united east and west in rev@@ ul@@ sion , which amaz@@ ingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the di@@ rest mis@@ ery .
ten years on , we went back to bes@@ lan in southern russia to find some of the victims who che@@ ated death in the class@@ room at@@ ro@@ city .
we discovered amazing young people , who have de@@ fied ad@@ versity , though the memory of this terrorist hel@@ l will live with them fore@@ ver .
their greatest hope ?
that the war now scar@@ ring ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop .
the girl pic@@ tured trying to clim@@ b back inside the b@@ lit@@ zed school gym
she was fam@@ ously sn@@ app@@ ed by top russian photograph@@ er d@@ mit@@ ry beli@@ ak@@ ov we@@ aring only her under@@ wear as tried to clim@@ b back inside the b@@ lit@@ zed school gym after a mine explo@@ ded .
be@@ wil@@ dered , a@@ id@@ a was desper@@ ately searching for her mother , lar@@ is@@ sa , now 40 .
both were fe@@ ared dead , but in fact they survi@@ ved .
&apos;@@ a woman told me to run for my life but i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t , &apos; said a@@ id@@ a at the time .
my leg@@ s were covered in blood .
i got up and clim@@ bed back in to look for my mum .
a soldi@@ er pl@@ uc@@ ked her to safety .
after a series of sur@@ ger@@ ies , she thought she had totally reco@@ vered but said yesterday : &apos; three months ago , the pain came back .
i fear i may need more sur@@ gery .
some sh@@ rap@@ nel pieces are still in my k@@ ne@@ e .
her aim now is to become a d@@ enti@@ st , to help people as she has been ai@@ ded by medic@@ s .
&apos;@@ this tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it , &apos; she said de@@ fi@@ antly .
&apos;@@ it happened to me and you can &apos;t change this fact .
once a year i always go to the gym to recall those who remained there .
my friends and i try not to talk about it on other days .
the pain is too much .
my best friend and my class@@ ma@@ te@@ -to-@@ be d@@ zer@@ a ga@@ po@@ eva was killed there .
we played together when we were small and dre@@ amed of going to school together .
&apos;@@ i don &apos;t want to mar@@ ry until i finish my studies and start my career .
i will think about a family later .
she says the sie@@ ge remains with her though mem@@ ories f@@ ade a little each year .
i am pleased that many people in the world still remember our trou@@ b@@ les and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in britain and everywhere .
when i see online the photo@@ graph of me climbing into the school window , i think that many people will see it for the first time , understand about our disaster , and stop this from happening any more .
the boy who f@@ led through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets believ@@ ing his mother to be dead
he was on his first day at school ( rus@@ sians start school aged 7 ) and survi@@ ved the three day sie@@ ge hu@@ gging his mum tam@@ ara .
then seven he said : &apos; m@@ um@@ my told me to lie down if there was an explo@@ sion and hold her hand . &apos; 
after one explo@@ sion he thought she was dying .
she told him : &apos; run &apos; .
fe@@ aring she was dead , he f@@ led and on his way he saw a cr@@ ying to@@ d@@ d@@ ler , gr@@ ab@@ bed the child by the hand , and f@@ led through a ha@@ il of bul@@ lets .
his dad v@@ la@@ di@@ mir , who sco@@ op@@ ed up his son outside , said : &apos; dam@@ ir told me his mother had died .
he said : &apos; i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t save her &apos; . &apos; 
in fact , tam@@ ara had st@@ um@@ b@@ led free and was in hospital with le@@ g w@@ ounds , in turn believ@@ ing her son had per@@ ished .
after their re@@ union she said : &apos; i we@@ pt with joy .
i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t believe it .
he ran in and hu@@ gged me .
dam@@ ir was later flo@@ wn to london ( by the now de@@ func@@ t news of the world newspaper ) to be crow@@ ned a bar@@ nar@@ do &apos;s children &apos;s champi@@ on by then premier ton@@ y bla@@ ir and wife wife ch@@ eri@@ e .
&apos;@@ this hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but i wish i could stop rec@@ alling it , &apos; he said yesterday .
still i can say that in my mind it is f@@ ading .
i remember right afterwards , i thre@@ w away all my to@@ y gun@@ s .
but now i can play computer games with sho@@ oting and it is not a problem for me .
&apos;@@ i &apos;m not s@@ ca@@ red to go back in the gym but i don &apos;t think about myself .
i remember those kids i used to play with in the yard who never got out .
we never say they were killed or dead .
we say they stayed in the gym .
i remember my trip to london so well , specially the to@@ y shop where i was allowed to pick anything i wanted , and riding in an open top car .
but now he fears for places like ukraine where wars cause the kind of mis@@ ery he and his friends suffered .
this hor@@ ror comes back to you every day , but i wish i could stop rec@@ alling it
&apos;@@ i feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these hor@@ r@@ ors , &apos; said dam@@ ir , who was last week doing voluntary work at a n@@ un@@ n@@ ery .
i want to help so much .
i want to serve in the police one day and hope they en@@ rol me to the training academy next year .
his mother tam@@ ara , 48 , said : &apos; 37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood , can you imagine ?
i remember terrible silence right after the sie@@ ge , there were just no children to sh@@ out and run around , and that silence las@@ ted for many months .
she vi@@ vi@@ dly rec@@ alls her trip with dam@@ ir to london .
people in london were cr@@ ying when i told our story .
i re@@ alised then how fol@@ k on the other side of the world can understand our feel@@ ings , can show their support .
she was grateful to &apos; ch@@ eri@@ e bla@@ ir and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to london in autumn 2004 .
i wish i could call ch@@ eri@@ e and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but i still remember meeting her and her hus@@ band in london , and how that helped dam@@ ir and me .
i remember when dam@@ ir wanted to eat bor@@ sch sou@@ p , they called all the local russian restaurants .
i remember how he was playing with wa@@ it@@ ers in a restaurant , dam@@ ir was sho@@ oting at them from his water pi@@ st@@ ol and they ran away and played with him .
and we were just one month away from our hor@@ ror then .
i was am@@ a@@ zed that the british people were so ready to share our pain and to support us .
she said : &apos; i keep thinking this world did not get better within these 10 years .
now in ukraine the war goes on , people are dying every day , and i believe many children were killed and will be killed .
they are just the same children , like ours .
i think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bo@@ red or busy with something else .
i just know what those people feel , the hor@@ ror of it .
and i can &apos;t stop feeling it .
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other and it is so sad .
dam@@ ir grew up and became a very gent@@ le and calm boy , he is not at all aggres@@ sive or an@@ gr@@ y .
he is not seeking reven@@ ge for example , he is not pre@@ occupied with this past hor@@ ror .
i know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six class@@ mates and they go to the gym from time to time and light c@@ and@@ les there .
when he was smaller he suffered from it - i remember he used to lie down on the sof@@ a with his face turned away from us , for hours at a time .
not sle@@ eping , his eyes were open .
i also remember how he thre@@ w away all his gun@@ s and other arm@@ y-@@ type to@@ y@@ s.@@ dam@@ ir is 17 now , t@@ all@@ er than me , nice looking , cle@@ ver and healthy .
i can hardly believe that for some hours i was so sure he was dead and i &apos;d never see him again .
when i managed to recover after the explo@@ sion and got on my feet i looked around , i saw the hel@@ l around me , when body parts were lying everywhere .
i was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survi@@ ved in this hel@@ l .
&apos;@@ i remember i was sh@@ ou@@ ting to him &apos; dam@@ ir , run , run away &apos; but again i was so sure he had not heard me .
but he did hear , and he did run away .
so life goes on for us unlike for so many .

comfort : bes@@ lan survi@@ v@@ or geor@@ gy il@@ y@@ in with his mum fa@@ tim@@ a after the sie@@ ge in 2004 , while on the right is geor@@ gy today
his bloo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined face was et@@ ched with fear as he ran for his life as chec@@ hen terrorists gun@@ ned down his class@@ mates .
his picture was one of the most sho@@ cking symb@@ ols of the bar@@ bar@@ ity at bes@@ lan .
his mother fa@@ tim@@ a , 54 , a senior g@@ p , had dro@@ pped him for his first day at school before rus@@ hing to take her el@@ der son v@@ la@@ di@@ mir to university .
&apos;@@ i left two minutes before the terrorists rus@@ hed into the yard , so my little boy was left there alone for three days of hor@@ ror , &apos; she rec@@ alled .
not completely alone , we had a family of rela@@ tives there but all of them were killed .
only my geor@@ gy managed to survive .
the closer this date is , the har@@ der it is to think and talk about it .
there is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy .
we do not feel it was long ago , i think it happened yesterday , some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time .
nobody will ever forget , i promise you .
ha@@ un@@ ting : the image of geor@@ gy ( left ) was one of the most sho@@ cking of the attack and has been im@@ mort@@ alised in a stat@@ ue ( right )
i remember geor@@ gy so much wanted to go to school on that day , he said he wanted to hu@@ g his teacher .
i only got to know he was alive when i saw him tv .
and now there is even a stat@@ ue to cr@@ ying geor@@ gy in san mar@@ ino .
geor@@ gy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the book@@ case in our home .
i understand , but i also think that thanks to this picture people from all over the world feel our pain .
geor@@ gy says now : &apos; it &apos;s important this can never happen again .
&apos;@@ i doubt we &apos;ll ever know the truth .
people keep investig@@ ating such trag@@ e@@ dies and never know the truth .
now they are investig@@ ating this bo@@ eing cr@@ ash in ukraine .
will we ever know what caused it ?
this world is moving to something very bad .
&apos;@@ i can &apos;t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , no-@@ one wants a war , so how does it happen ?
ten years is nothing for such pain .
we need do@@ z@@ ens of years to pass in order to forget it a little .
it affected my health and i still feel it .
for about three or four years i had some night@@ ma@@ res because of the sie@@ ge but then it got better .
i got back to school later in 2004 , i was very s@@ ca@@ red every day .
i was thinking about my friends and class@@ mates who were killed .
this is why i keep going to the gym as each 1 september approaches .
i want to pay tribute to my old child@@ hood friends .
it is hard for me to go inside the gym but i must do it .
i do not feel myself a victim , this story is the part of my past now .
i will not forget it but i do not feel sorry for myself .
my life goes on .
i finished school this year entered a medical university in v@@ la@@ di@@ k@@ av@@ ka@@ z .
i will learn to be a heart sur@@ ge@@ on .
my first choice was to go in the army .
i wanted to be a military man , but my health did not let me .
i wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen .
geor@@ gy far@@ ni@@ ye@@ v , 20
the boy who survi@@ ved despite having been tr@@ app@@ ed at the feet of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist
mir@@ ac@@ ulous : geor@@ gy far@@ ni@@ ye@@ v was tr@@ app@@ ed at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist during the sie@@ ge but still managed to survive
as the sie@@ ge was under@@ way , he was pic@@ tured tr@@ app@@ ed inside the gym , sitting next to a bom@@ b at the foot of a mur@@ der@@ ous terrorist .
it is truly a mir@@ acle he was not killed .
&apos;@@ we feel as if it was just yesterday , &apos; said geor@@ gy , who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the f@@ s@@ b , but was unable to because of damage to his health in the sie@@ ge .
it is still with me , this is not something i left behind .
i am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - i must say this is not true .
&apos;@@ in 2006 i worked with psycho@@ logi@@ sts and i did feel a bit better afterwards but i can &apos;t forget it .
and i would like to forget .
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when i went inside the gym again .
i lost consci@@ ousness .
i would never ever go there again and please don &apos;t ask me to show where i sat in that well-known picture .
survi@@ v@@ or : geor@@ gy far@@ ni@@ e@@ v pic@@ tured today , with a photo@@ graph of him in hospital fol@@ l@@ wo@@ ing the sie@@ ge on his lap@@ top
my pain is enormous and i carry it with me every day .
my friends know that i do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school .
in terms of physical condition i am well .
i should be careful with my k@@ ne@@ e which was in@@ ju@@ red but i walk fine now .
still my health did not let me go and study in f@@ s@@ b secret service academy in st pe@@ ter@@ sburg as i wanted .
i sent my documents , including medical papers , and they rep@@ lied it was not possible .
my second passion was animals , so i went to the veter@@ inary institute .
i have completed two years there .
he is learning to treat all animals &apos; from c@@ ats to co@@ ws &apos; .
he said : &apos; i know i would never tell my children about my experience .
this is not something children should know about , and of course not something they should experience .
his mother marina , 42 , said : &apos; this pain never leaves me .
it is in my soul , worse when the anniversary gets close .
i will go and attend cere@@ mon@@ ies being held to mark it .
i know geor@@ gy won &apos;t go .
it must be even stronger for him because he was there and i was not .
i was waiting for him at home , not able to help .
i am so grateful to god that he was returned to me@@ .@@ here in bes@@ lan the im@@ print is on everyone .
it stays with us .
geor@@ gy is an adult now but that hor@@ ror is still with him .
it is hard to accept it when something so terri@@ bly unfair happens to you .
he is a boy , he li@@ kes sports but he can &apos;t take part because of his k@@ ne@@ e .
he had several sur@@ ger@@ ies , he walks but cannot exercise .
i would say he 50 % over@@ came this hor@@ ror , but one can never completely overcome and forget it .
this hor@@ ri@@ ble experience will stay with us .
many friends and neighbours were killed in the sie@@ ge , and it only adds to my pain .
i lost many people i knew well and they were dear for me .
my son is with me and this is the greatest gift god could do for me but my heart aches about those killed .
i know families where new children were born , but also wi@@ do@@ ws who never married again .
it is hard to accept that life goes on , even if you do not want it .
i will never forget my heart jum@@ ping out of my ch@@ est at the moment i saw him in hospital .
now i look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions .
what are those people fighting for ?
why are they killing each other ?
the war is very close to our country now and i can hardly believe it .
we used to be one friendly country in the past , how did it happen that we are fighting now ?
people and children are suffering , i am sure many children were already killed in ukraine and many will be killed .
if we could only gra@@ b all the re@@ be@@ ls and throw them away - as far away as possible .

4 tips for better under@@ water photos and video
if you &apos;re interested in sho@@ oting photos or video under@@ water , you have a variety of equipment choices .
the che@@ apest option is a water@@ proof poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot , such as the ni@@ kon cool@@ pi@@ x aw@@ 120 or an action c@@ am , such as the g@@ op@@ ro her@@ o@@ 3 + silver edition , which both go for around $ 300 .
i shot these photos at a family party using several cameras , all pric@@ ed under $ 3@@ 50 .
no matter what gear you use , a few rules apply for getting the best results .
doub@@ le-@@ check your gear .
even if you have a water@@ proof camera , make sure that the camera &apos;s battery and other com@@ part@@ ments are ti@@ gh@@ tly closed .
also , set your camera to match the type of photos or video you &apos;ll be sho@@ oting .
some cameras and cam@@ cor@@ ders have scene or sho@@ oting modes that will optimi@@ ze the exposure for di@@ m under@@ sea settings .
and before you jum@@ p in , know how deep your equipment can go .
some cameras are ra@@ ted to only 5 feet , others to 50 or 60 feet .
check out our buying guide and rat@@ ings for digital cameras for both conventional and water@@ proof models .
take multiple sho@@ ts - because many of them won &apos;t work .
poin@@ t-@@ and-@@ sho@@ ot cameras have l@@ c@@ ds to help you com@@ pose photos , while action cam@@ s generally don &apos;t .
even if you have an l@@ cd , it &apos;s going to hard to see it under@@ water , and com@@ posing your shot will be a hit@@ -@@ or-@@ miss process .
so sho@@ ot multi@@ ples .
also , if your camera has a br@@ ack@@ et mode , which sho@@ ots a bur@@ st of sho@@ ts at slightly different exposure settings , take advantage of it .
stay near the surface .
light falls off dram@@ atically the de@@ eper you dive under@@ water .
if possible , stay close to the surface when you sho@@ ot in a pool , a lake or the ocean .
this will also allow you to capture more color in your photos ; the de@@ eper you go , the less color you &apos;ll see .
get close to your subjects .
this is great advice for sho@@ oting on dry land , but it is even more important under@@ water because of the di@@ m lighting conditions .
it &apos;s particularly important if you &apos;re sho@@ oting with an action c@@ am : these devices often have a fixed , wide angle lens , which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame .
andre@@ w law@@ son was the kind of man whose force of person@@ ality could sha@@ ke things up , even in a gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ an organisation like the n@@ h@@ s .
a consult@@ ant an@@ aes@@ the@@ ti@@ st , he devoted his career to spar@@ ing the si@@ ck both the ag@@ on@@ ies of ill@@ ness and the tor@@ ments of treatment .
among those who sought him out , his wife re@@ members , was an mi@@ 6 officer who had to live with the cri@@ p@@ pling after@@ -@@ effects of torture .
law@@ son understood that while doctors are cap@@ tiv@@ ated by diagno@@ ses and diseases , those being treated are overwhel@@ m@@ ingly concerned with something else entirely : pain .
one day in 2007 , however , he was the one who began to suffer .
&quot; i have not felt myself , &quot; he wrote in may that year .
i &apos;ve had difficulty in ener@@ g@@ ising myself .
strugg@@ ling with flu@@ -@@ like symp@@ t@@ oms , he found himself im@@ pati@@ ently ber@@ ating his wife , ju@@ li@@ et .
&quot; i want everything to happen so@@ on@@ er rather than later , &quot; he noted .
when ju@@ li@@ et went away on business for a week , law@@ son found himself un@@ usually , and un@@ accoun@@ tably , up@@ set .
something was up .
he got a colleague to perform a ch@@ est x-@@ ray .
just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the french alps .
the results of the x-@@ ray came back .
he had mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , an incur@@ able cancer that affects the ple@@ ura , or lining of the l@@ ung .
with most can@@ c@@ ers , it is hard to know the exact cause .
though some smo@@ kers get l@@ ung cancer , for example , not all l@@ ung cancer suff@@ e@@ rers have smo@@ ked .
but mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is different .
in almost every case , the cause is exposure to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s - a fi@@ br@@ ous building material once du@@ b@@ bed &quot; mir@@ ac@@ ulous , &quot; but now known to be mort@@ ally dangerous .
for most of us , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a has been an easy disease to ignore .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , after all , is a product of the past .
the most dangerous type of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been used in britain since the 196@@ 0s , when a voluntary industry ban came into effect .
even when it was used , only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pi@@ pe lag@@ gers , buil@@ ders , car@@ p@@ ent@@ ers and shi@@ py@@ ard workers , for example .
an industrial tox@@ in from another era , it hardly seems cause for concern today .
but such com@@ plac@@ ency is mis@@ placed .
britain , it turns out , is today at the peak of a mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic .
there are more mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a deaths here than in any other country on the planet .
with an annual tol@@ l of about 2,@@ 500 , more than twice as many people die of the disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles .
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a annual deaths since 1980 and projec@@ ted future deaths in great britain
the reason that we are feeling its dead@@ ly effects now is that , though as@@ be@@ sto@@ s use has been illegal for years ( all types of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , it usually takes decades for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a to develop .
and the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a s@@ cour@@ ge is not con@@ fined to veter@@ ans of industrial building jobs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has been , and in many cases still is , embedded in the homes we live in , the offices we work in , the schools we are educ@@ ated in , and the stores we shop in .
as a result , mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is no respec@@ ter of class , wealth , occupation , or age .
the bas@@ tions of privile@@ ge , from smart london department stores to public schools , have proved no refu@@ ge .
the houses of parliament are rid@@ d@@ led with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
even the hospit@@ als that are meant to make us better have been reser@@ vo@@ irs of this dead@@ ly car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
andre@@ w law@@ son was not old .
nor was he a pi@@ pe lag@@ ger .
in fact , he strugg@@ led to think where he might have come into contact with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
then he put his fing@@ er on it .
&quot; it seems that there may have been a lot of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the tun@@ nels at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital where i spent six years training , &quot; he wrote .
everybody - students , nur@@ ses , doctors and porters - used the tun@@ nels .
one won@@ ders how many of my con@@ tempor@@ aries will get the same disease ?
it was a question to which , s@@ adly , he was able to provide a partial answer .
&quot; of four doctors who trained at gu@@ y &apos;s hospital and who subsequently developed mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a in the past five years , &quot; he noted in a letter in 2010 , &quot; i am the only one left alive . &quot;
how many of us will get this disease ?
andre@@ w law@@ son was diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a when he was 48 .
when he died , on february 17 this year , he was 55 .
to survive so long is unusual .
fif@@ ty per cent of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a suff@@ e@@ rers are dead 8 months after diagno@@ sis .
it is always fat@@ al .
so now we can only echo law@@ son &apos;s question : &quot; how many of us will get the same disease ? &quot;
according to britain &apos;s leading expert on mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , professor ju@@ lian pe@@ to , our best gu@@ ess is that between 197@@ 0 and 20@@ 50 , when the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ep@@ ide@@ mic in britain should have played itself out , some 9@@ 0,000 people will have died .
most currently have no idea that they will die this way .
an as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mine in que@@ be@@ c , canada al@@ am@@ y
a quick gl@@ ance at the reports from the courts , where those affected often turn for compensation , shows how far the s@@ cour@@ ge of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a has spread .
this june , for example , marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er ad@@ mitted neglig@@ ently ex@@ posing jan@@ ice allen to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
she worked for the chain for nine years , from 197@@ 8 to 198@@ 7 , supervis@@ ing clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flag@@ ship store on ox@@ ford street .
mrs allen was only 18 when she started working at m &amp; s .
now she has two children in their 20@@ s .
&quot; before this happened , &quot; she says , &quot; i had never heard of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , i bare@@ ly knew about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
i never would have dre@@ amed that i would be affected by it .
few people do know much about as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
in fact , as@@ be@@ sto@@ s describes not one substance but a group of six min@@ er@@ als .
they get their name from the word &quot; as@@ b@@ esti@@ form &quot; - which describes the fi@@ br@@ ous structure which en@@ do@@ ws them with strength and flexibility .
of the six , three have commonly been used in the building trade .
ch@@ ry@@ so@@ tile , commonly known as white as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , is by far the most frequently found in buildings today .
it was used in roof@@ ing panels , floor tiles , pi@@ pe insul@@ ation , bo@@ iler se@@ als , even bra@@ ke lin@@ ings in cars .
it is less le@@ th@@ al than other forms of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , but it &apos;s still considered a &quot; major health ha@@ z@@ ard &quot; that can kill by the eu and who .
more dangerous , however , are brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( am@@ o@@ site ) and blue as@@ be@@ sto@@ s ( cro@@ ci@@ dol@@ ite ) .
britain was once the world &apos;s largest im@@ porter of brown as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and experts suggest that &quot; there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uni@@ qu@@ ely high mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a rate &#91; in the uk &#93; . &quot;
a marks &amp; sp@@ enc@@ er employee was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s at its flag@@ ship store in ox@@ ford street , london al@@ am@@ y
jan@@ ice allen may not have thought of her@@ self as a typical victim of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a , but ju@@ lian pe@@ to &apos;s work suggests that her story is far from un@@ common .
he has produced a study of suff@@ e@@ rers which suggests that &quot; a substantial proportion of mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ omas with no known occu@@ pa@@ tional or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposure . &quot;
much of that exposure , he says , is due to &quot; normal occupation and wea@@ thering &quot; of our buildings .
no one , it seems , can be sure that they are safe .
a report from go@@ d@@ d@@ ard consulting , which looked at the palace of west@@ min@@ ster , shows how people , even in the heart of government , might have been exposed un@@ awa@@ res .
in 2009 go@@ d@@ d@@ ard reported that service sha@@ fts and pi@@ ping duc@@ ts behind parliamentary committee rooms were contam@@ inated with as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , whose le@@ th@@ al fi@@ b@@ res could be distur@@ bed by something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as &quot; strong curren@@ ts of air . &quot;
m@@ ps are frequently accused of looking after their own interests , but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true .
while the parliamentary works services director@@ ate insi@@ sted that the palace of west@@ min@@ ster had been given &quot; a clean bill of health , &quot; it is now accepted £ 1@@ b@@ n of work lasting several years is required to over@@ hau@@ l parliament , up@@ gr@@ ading electr@@ ics and removing as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , and that after the 20@@ 15 general election m@@ ps may sit in the nearby q@@ e@@ 2 conference centre rather than on the green ben@@ ches at west@@ min@@ ster .
the go@@ d@@ d@@ ard report noted that &quot; the presence of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations . &quot;
it is impossible to know if this mis@@ management will cost lives .
all anyone can do now is wait .
one person who has never been able to pin@@ point his exposure to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t , a g@@ p .
like andre@@ w law@@ son , ab@@ bot@@ t , 50 , susp@@ ects that he was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s while working in hospit@@ als .
&quot; i have worked at a hospital where positive as@@ be@@ sto@@ s claims have been made , &quot; he says , &quot; but i can &apos;t prove it in my case .
it &apos;s so hard to remember all the places one has worked in , and the dates .
what he re@@ members clearly is the day early in december in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fe@@ ver .
he was 45 , and in the middle of a late evening sur@@ gery .
suddenly i started feeling shi@@ very .
it came on very quickly .
i felt d@@ read@@ ful .
i didn &apos;t think i was going to be able to drive all the way home .
being a doctor , ab@@ bot@@ t knew that the pain was coming from the ple@@ ura , the lining around his lun@@ gs .
but like jan@@ ice allen , he simply had no reason to susp@@ ect mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
he ended up spending a month off work .
pu@@ zz@@ led doctors gave him ch@@ est x-@@ ra@@ ys , and ad@@ min@@ istered ple@@ ural cathe@@ ters to draw off flu@@ id from the lun@@ gs and send it for assessment .
yet the condition went un@@ diagno@@ sed .
slowly his health improved and he went back to work .
but from time to time the same symp@@ t@@ oms returned , often after he took exercise and was bre@@ a@@ thing hard .
in 2011 , one of ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s patients arrived at his g@@ p &apos;s sur@@ gery with similar symp@@ t@@ oms to him , and was subsequently diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
but even then ab@@ bot@@ t didn &apos;t make the connection with his own case .
after all , his patient was decades older , and had worked directly as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
the link in that case was clear .
in september 2011 , ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s condition wor@@ sen@@ ed again , and his consult@@ ant took his c@@ t sc@@ ans and x-@@ ra@@ ys to a panel of experts .
in december 2011 , exactly two years after ab@@ bot@@ t started feeling un@@ well , a pro@@ be , equipped with a camera , was fed into the cav@@ ity between the lining of his ch@@ est and the lining of his l@@ ung .
i &apos;m an optim@@ ist .
i tend just to p@@ lo@@ d along , &quot; he says .
i h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t wor@@ ried about it too much to be honest .
but rac@@ hel , my wife , was worrying .
the result of the bi@@ op@@ sy came in the week between christmas and new year : &quot; i was told it was mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a . &quot;
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t : diagno@@ sed with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a
suddenly ab@@ bot@@ t was pl@@ un@@ ged into meetings with mac@@ mill@@ an nur@@ ses , one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a law@@ yer .
that was when he re@@ alised the scale of the ep@@ ide@@ mic .
&quot; it turns out that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was widely used , particularly in big public buildings which quite often had as@@ be@@ sto@@ s lag@@ ging on the pi@@ pes , &quot; he says .
people who were exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in those buildings are now coming down with the disease .
so mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is now affecting younger people not in the typical profes@@ sions .
the most dangerous as@@ be@@ sto@@ s-@@ lag@@ ged pi@@ pes in hospit@@ als were below ground level , so patients are unlikely to have been affected .
but many staff , walking in pede@@ strian tun@@ nels to get from one building to another ( like andre@@ w law@@ son ) , or eating in bas@@ ement can@@ te@@ ens ( as gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t frequently did ) almost certainly did come into contact with the tox@@ ic substance .
for several decades after the war , it turns out , hospit@@ als were potentially life@@ -@@ saving places for patients , but life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening places for the doctors who treated them .
it is still being removed today .
pu@@ pil@@ s per@@ ched their bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s
and it is not just hospit@@ als .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s was frequently used in offices , shops , libraries and town h@@ alls for its mar@@ v@@ ell@@ ous insul@@ ating and fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ ding properties .
schools too .
in fact many people will have been first exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the class@@ room .
up and down the country , in my@@ ri@@ ad chem@@ i@@ stry lessons , pu@@ pil@@ s have per@@ ched their bun@@ sen bur@@ ners on as@@ be@@ sto@@ s mat@@ s .
websites have sp@@ run@@ g up to address the issue of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in schools .
meanwhile , in our homes , items as inno@@ cu@@ ous as floor tiles or sh@@ ed roof@@ s have rout@@ inely contained as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
&quot; it &apos;s an industrial po@@ ison built into large amounts of our housing stock , &quot; notes andre@@ w mor@@ gan , the law@@ yer who represented andre@@ w law@@ son in his case against gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
in one case the only contact the woman suff@@ e@@ rer could think of was pul@@ ling down a garden sh@@ ed in the 197@@ 0s .
so be careful how you pul@@ l down the garden sh@@ ed .
the impact of diagno@@ sis , knowing that the disease is incur@@ able , is huge .
&quot; it takes a while to sin@@ k in , &quot; says gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t .
i went back to work and tried to carry on but re@@ alised that i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t concentrate on what i was doing .
i was at the sur@@ gery for two weeks .
then i re@@ alised that i would have to leave and sort myself out .
well , i won &apos;t see christmas again
one of the hard@@ est things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient .
like countless patients before him , he re@@ members feeling be@@ wil@@ dered by the amount of information to get to gri@@ ps with .
&quot; it was hard to take everything in , &quot; he says .
&quot; i asked my consult@@ ant &quot; how long do i have ? &quot;
i was quo@@ ted about 12 months .
i remember thinking &quot; well , i won &apos;t see christmas again .
that &apos;s it . &quot; &quot;
mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a is particularly per@@ n@@ icious , because it is the mechan@@ ics of how we stay alive - the very act of bre@@ a@@ thing - that causes the cancer that k@@ ills .
most mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a cases are caused by exposure to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is made up of tiny fi@@ b@@ res .
when the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is distur@@ bed and the fi@@ b@@ res are in@@ hal@@ ed , they can become embedded in the ple@@ ura , the lining of the lun@@ gs .
as@@ be@@ sto@@ s fi@@ b@@ res ir@@ rit@@ ate the ple@@ ura and can cause cell mu@@ tations .
&quot; the problem comes from in@@ hal@@ ed nee@@ d@@ le-@@ shaped fi@@ b@@ res of as@@ be@@ sto@@ s , &quot; professor tom treas@@ ure , a car@@ di@@ o-@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ on who moved in 2001 to gu@@ y &apos;s hospital .
the very hospital where andre@@ w law@@ son susp@@ ected he was exposed to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is now , ir@@ on@@ ically , a leading centre in tre@@ ating mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
treas@@ ure knew law@@ son , and treated some others who are likely to have been exposed while training at the hospital .
once the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s nee@@ d@@ les get into the l@@ ung tissu@@ e , says treas@@ ure , &quot; the act of bre@@ a@@ thing pus@@ hes them on the periph@@ ery , which is where the lining is .
it is by its nature inv@@ a@@ sive from the very beginning .
the normal options for tre@@ ating other forms of cancer work less well with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a .
the effectiveness of sur@@ gery , for example , is ho@@ tly debated .
some feel it is worth trying .
treas@@ ure dis@@ agrees .
&quot; you can &apos;t exc@@ ise the ple@@ ura , &quot; he says .
you can &apos;t get your k@@ ni@@ fe round it .
meanwhile the cancer &quot; is not very respon@@ sive to chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y , &quot; which &quot; has an effect &quot; but does not cure .
&quot; every now and again you get long survi@@ v@@ ors , &quot; says treas@@ ure .
but in the end they all die .
happ@@ ily , some patients do live far , far beyond expectations .
the author ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould died 20 years after diagno@@ sis .
two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years after his own diagno@@ sis , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t is still batt@@ ling on .
after cont@@ acting mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a ab@@ bot@@ t was put in touch with andre@@ w law@@ son , who , four years after his diagno@@ sis , had become a one-@@ man support and advice bureau for fellow suff@@ e@@ rers .
&quot; hel@@ lo , cancer central , &quot; he would announce che@@ er@@ ily when they called .
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
he had been diagno@@ sed 4 years before and was still very active .
initially , ab@@ bot@@ t had been offered six cy@@ cles of chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y that would take four months , and likely pro@@ long his life by just one month .
&quot; i felt desper@@ ate , &quot; he says .
i felt like giving up .
law@@ son , however , &quot; managed to put a slightly better t@@ int on things . &quot;
after seeing several consult@@ ants , ab@@ bot@@ t decided to pursue his treatment with pr@@ of lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski , professor in thor@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ gery at gu@@ y &apos;s .
&quot; we had an advantage in that i didn &apos;t have to be referred , i just ran@@ g them up and they saw me , &quot; gra@@ ham ad@@ mits .
the average patient would have to get a re@@ ferr@@ al and have funding approved .
money is crucial for those with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a to pursue the best available treatments .
but when those treatments eventually , inevitably , fail , many suff@@ e@@ rers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind .
and so they turn to the courts in pursu@@ it of compensation .
andre@@ w law@@ son cont@@ acted andre@@ w mor@@ gan , from field fish@@ er water@@ house ll@@ p .
&quot; it has been known that as@@ be@@ sto@@ s is no@@ x@@ ious to health since 18@@ 98 , &quot; says mor@@ gan .
but what changed in the 196@@ 0s is that it was re@@ alised that even very low levels could be a risk to health .
that is where company neglig@@ ence came in .
andre@@ w law@@ son and gu@@ y &apos;s hospital eventually settled their case , but it was not what mor@@ gan calls a &quot; full-@@ value settlement &quot; since law@@ son could not prove defini@@ tively that his mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a was down to as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposure at gu@@ y &apos;s .
after the in@@ quest into his death , a spo@@ kes@@ man for gu@@ y &apos;s did confirm , however , that &quot; the as@@ be@@ sto@@ s in the bas@@ ement area concerned was removed in the 199@@ 0s . &quot;
that was too late for andre@@ w law@@ son .
how to remove as@@ be@@ sto@@ s
in fact , pin@@ ning le@@ th@@ al as@@ be@@ sto@@ s exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved a huge problem for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a suff@@ e@@ rers seeking compensation .
many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business .
insurance records may have been lost .
and those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side , which the claim@@ ants certainly do not .
in response , this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be trac@@ ed .
the law has created a £ 3@@ 50@@ m pot of money , funded by the insurance industry , for those diagno@@ sed after july 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to su@@ e .
in these cases suff@@ e@@ rers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court might have awarded in a normal compensation case - about £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 .
about 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year .
andre@@ w mor@@ gan , like many involved with mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a suff@@ e@@ rers , thin@@ ks that £ 3@@ 50@@ m represents &quot; a very good job &quot; for the insurance industry .
&quot; it &apos;s a deal written by insu@@ rers for insu@@ rers &quot; he says , sugge@@ sting that the sum is a quarter of what insu@@ rers would have had to pay if the pass@@ age of time had not interven@@ ed , and mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a suff@@ e@@ rers were able to track down companies and su@@ e them in the normal way .
even mi@@ ke pen@@ ning , then works and pensions minister , ad@@ mitted that the law was &quot; not perfect . &quot;
but both pen@@ ning and mor@@ gan admit that , with seven victims dying each day , quick action was needed .
&quot; people are suffering so much , and need help today , &quot; said pen@@ ning during the mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a bill &apos;s second reading in december last year .
by then , gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t had been in the hands of pr@@ of lo@@ ic lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski for 19 months .
after their initial consul@@ tations , lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski advis@@ ed sur@@ gery which , in contrast to tom treas@@ ure , he believes has a positive effect .
this was followed by radi@@ other@@ ap@@ y and chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y - a tri@@ -@@ therapy for which lan@@ g-@@ la@@ z@@ dun@@ ski can bo@@ ast five year survival rates as high as 40 per cent .
ab@@ bot@@ t felt em@@ powered .
&quot; that of course is one of the most important things , &quot; says ab@@ bot@@ t .
you see it in patients all the time .
there is some drive that keeps you going .
when you give up you can deterior@@ ate very quickly .
gra@@ ham ab@@ bot@@ t went in for sur@@ gery in march 2012 .
by the end of august he had completed the last of his six cy@@ cles of chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y .
follow-up sc@@ ans revealed no sign of the disease .
then i had my s@@ can in march &#91; 20@@ 14 &#93; .
there was multiple spo@@ tting &#91; of cancer &#93; around my ch@@ est .
i was just about to turn 50 .
it &apos;s not life threat@@ ening .
it &apos;s life ending .
once again ab@@ bot@@ t put himself through six cy@@ cles of chem@@ other@@ ap@@ y .
now there is no sign of the t@@ um@@ ours .
but the process is both physi@@ cally and emo@@ tionally gru@@ elling .
you have to think about practical things - about the finances when i &apos;m gone for example , or showing my wife how the bo@@ iler tim@@ er works .
when you get bad news you start getting negative .
you have to look forward .
as the father of el@@ lie , 16 , and tam@@ s@@ in , 14 , that is not always easy .
&quot; it &apos;s hard as a parent , &quot; he says .
it is difficult to know what to say and how much to say .
when i was first diagno@@ sed i told the girls that i had a condition that meant i was@@ n &apos;t going to become old .
they re@@ acted very differently .
tam@@ s@@ in is very soci@@ able and bo@@ i@@ ster@@ ous .
she told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly .
el@@ lie was more reserved .
she didn &apos;t say much .
such conver@@ sa@@ tions are something that all cancer patients must face .
but for mes@@ o@@ the@@ li@@ om@@ a suff@@ e@@ rers such discussions are not leav@@ ened by hope , by even a g@@ lim@@ mer of a possibility of survival .
the disease carri@@ es with it ( even as it did , eventually , for ste@@ ph@@ en j@@ ay g@@ ould ) a gri@@ m certainty .

china ref@@ uses to give hong kong right to choose leaders ; prote@@ sters vo@@ w ven@@ ge@@ ance
china &apos;s parliament decided sunday against le@@ tting hong kong voters nom@@ in@@ ate candidates for the 20@@ 17 election , despite growing ag@@ itation for democratic reform .
the move is likely to s@@ park long-@@ promised pro@@ tests in hong kong &apos;s business district , as activi@@ sts began planning and mobili@@ zing within hours of the announcement .
the decision by china &apos;s national people &apos;s congress essentially allows communist leaders to we@@ ed out any candidates not loy@@ al to beijing .
&quot; it &apos;s not un@@ expected , but it is still in@@ fur@@ i@@ ating , &quot; said legisl@@ ator em@@ ily la@@ u , chair@@ woman of the democratic party .
this is not what beijing promised .
they &apos;ve lied to the people of hong kong .
and it &apos;s clear we are dealing with an author@@ itarian regime .
defending china &apos;s ruling , li fe@@ i , depu@@ ty secretary general of the standing committee of the national people &apos;s congress , said allowing public nom@@ inations in the election for hong kong &apos;s leader would be too &quot; cha@@ otic . &quot;
since 1997 , when britain handed control of hong kong back to china , beijing had promised to allow the region &apos;s residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 20@@ 17 .
chinese leaders presented the sunday ruling as a democratic break@@ through because it gives hong k@@ ong@@ ers a direct vote , but the decision also makes clear that chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nom@@ in@@ ating committee ti@@ gh@@ tly controlled by beijing .
and , according to a new clause , only candidates who &quot; love the country , and love hong kong &quot; would be allowed .
the ruling comes after a summer that has featured some of the largest and most high-@@ profile pro@@ tests in hong kong in years .
behind much of the pro-@@ democracy campaign in hong kong is the occup@@ y central with love and peace movement , whose organiz@@ ers have threatened to sh@@ ut down the financial district if beijing does not grant authentic universal suff@@ r@@ age .
on sunday night , within hours of the announcement , hundreds of occup@@ y central sup@@ porters had assemb@@ led in the rain outside the hong kong government &apos;s headquarters .
at the demonstration , organiz@@ ers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ence and that they would mount waves of pro@@ tests in the coming weeks .
however , they did not give details , apparently looking to avoid problems with authorities .
in an online statement , organiz@@ ers said the movement &quot; has considered occup@@ ying central only as the last resort , an action to be taken only if all chan@@ ces of dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted and there is no other choice .
we are very sorry to say that today all chan@@ ces of dialogue have been exhaus@@ ted and the occupation of central will definitely happen .
authorities in hong kong have been preparing for beijing &apos;s announcement for days , and security was tight sunday at the government headquarters , with police and bar@@ ric@@ ades deplo@@ yed .
driving the un@@ rest is a sense among many in hong kong that they are slowly losing control over their city .
an influ@@ x of main@@ land@@ ers is fu@@ eling competition for products and services .
there is also growing fear that hong kong &apos;s values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , are beginning to b@@ end under increasing pressure from beijing .
some have cri@@ tici@@ zed the occup@@ y central movement , saying its demonstra@@ tions put business - the life@@ blood of hong kong - at risk .
&quot; the protest they are talking about , it could result in much economic damage , depending on how many are involved and for how long , &quot; said legisl@@ ator reg@@ ina ip , who has long cri@@ tici@@ zed the movement .
we don &apos;t want concern to spread that hong kong is getting out of control .
this is a percep@@ tion that is bad for investment .
china &apos;s state@@ -@@ run media also has run stories in recent days painting hong kong &apos;s democracy activi@@ sts as agents of sub@@ version directed by western powers .
this summer , activi@@ sts organized an un@@ official referendum on voting rights that dre@@ w 7@@ 8@@ 0,000 participants - more than a fifth of hong kong voters .
and in july , tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-@@ democracy demonstra@@ tions in the region &apos;s history .
us pro@@ m culture h@@ its university life with fres@@ h@@ ers offered private jet en@@ tran@@ ces
we &apos;re ex@@ ci@@ ted to be answ@@ ering this demand by laun@@ ching the uk &apos;s first luxurious travel service for the students of today .
to make the maximum impact arriving at university , the company also offers transport options including private jet , roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce ph@@ an@@ tom , ast@@ on martin or m@@ cla@@ ren p@@ 1 .
mr ste@@ w@@ art also claimed the service had a safety aspect .
the service is an ideal alternative for students who would usually have to hau@@ l their belong@@ ings across the country in a danger@@ ously over@@ loaded car .
pa@@ ired with our new vi@@ f options , we &apos;re looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum f@@ uss and maximum luxury .
a spo@@ kes@@ man for the company said that because the service has just launched there have been no book@@ ings yet but added that &quot; students will be booking the service over the next few weeks . &quot;
the company also said that despite students facing tu@@ ition fees of £ 9@@ ,000 a year , it still expected to find a market for the service .
students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , compared to students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago - it &apos;s more important than ever to make a great first impression and vi@@ f is just the way to do that .
however , the national union of students critic@@ ised the service as out of touch .
me@@ gan dun@@ n , n@@ us vice president for higher education , said : &quot; this scheme seems incredi@@ bly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students .
many students starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis , with available financial support in loans and grants failing to keep pace with spir@@ alling b@@ ills for basic essenti@@ als , before they can even start thinking about for@@ king out thousands of p@@ ounds for something as simple arriving at their h@@ alls of residence .
fem@@ ini@@ sts take on race and police conduct post-@@ fer@@ g@@ us@@ on
the un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager was killed by a police officer in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo . , earlier this month .
atten@@ de@@ es hold their hands up while chan@@ ting , &quot; hands up , don &apos;t sho@@ ot , &quot; as they wait in line before the fun@@ eral .
after two weeks of pro@@ tests in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , mo@@ . over the sho@@ oting of un@@ armed te@@ en@@ ager michael brown , blo@@ gger mi@@ ri@@ am zo@@ il@@ a pe@@ re@@ z noticed a shift in the online con@@ vers@@ ation among white fem@@ ini@@ sts .
in her experience , white fem@@ in@@ ist comm@@ ent@@ ers pri@@ ori@@ tiz@@ ed gender above race when it came to pus@@ hing forward re@@ productive rights and income inequality .
but as ten@@ sions rose in the mid@@ west and dre@@ w nation@@ wide coverage , pe@@ re@@ z saw responses from white women that cen@@ tered 100 percent around race .
compared to the responses of black women soon after the sho@@ oting on august 9 , the personal es@@ says with tit@@ les like &quot; thoughts on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on as a white woman &quot; and &quot; fem@@ in@@ ism is not just about women &apos;s op@@ pression &quot; came relatively late .
but to pe@@ re@@ z , it demonstrated a significant shift .
&quot; in fem@@ in@@ ism , i don &apos;t think you get a lot of people talking about wh@@ it@@ en@@ ess and privile@@ ge in such a high level way , &quot; she said .
people felt called to voice something about what happened .
it &apos;s very emb@@ le@@ matic of the crisis we face and because &#91; the situation in fer@@ g@@ us@@ on &#93; is so r@@ aci@@ alized , they have to call that out .
for o@@ hi@@ o state university english professor k@@ ori@@ th@@ a mit@@ ch@@ ell , fer@@ g@@ us@@ on brought to light issues that black american women face every day but that are@@ n &apos;t seen as &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere .
&quot; i can post something fun@@ ny on fac@@ e@@ book about what &apos;s going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 li@@ kes from all over the place , &quot; said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
when i post something about how people of color are under sie@@ ge in their own country , the silence is de@@ af@@ ening .
&quot; how is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere ? &quot; she asked .
for black women like mit@@ ch@@ ell who have studied race , gender and sex@@ u@@ ality in u.s. history , there is no dic@@ ho@@ tom@@ y between issues regarding race and gender .
to her , black women have not had the luxury of ne@@ at@@ ly separ@@ ating the issues ; they live the combined reality every day .
while white women are now combining issues of race and gender in main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ist sp@@ he@@ res , ang@@ ela hat@@ tery , women and gender studies professor at george mas@@ on university , says their pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors did the opposite .
&quot; between 18@@ 65 and 18@@ 90 , at least 10@@ ,000 black men were ly@@ n@@ ched and the justi@@ fication was almost always the ra@@ pe of a white woman , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
you needed the white woman to be complic@@ it in the nar@@ ra@@ tive to justify the ly@@ n@@ ching .
to hat@@ tery , the break@@ down between white and black women came when white suff@@ r@@ ag@@ ists like sus@@ an b@@ . an@@ th@@ ony surve@@ yed the landscape in the late 18@@ 00@@ s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time : women or bl@@ acks .
&quot; they made the decision to put their e@@ gg@@ s in the bas@@ ket for votes for women and votes for bl@@ acks would come later , &quot; said hat@@ tery .
to look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don &apos;t trust white women .
we haven &apos;t done a good job .
we haven &apos;t helped black women protect their hus@@ bands and s@@ ons ever .
even after women won the right to vote in 19@@ 20 , it took a decade for white women to organize against ly@@ n@@ ching as the association of southern woman for the prevention of ly@@ n@@ ching .
the group came nearly 40 years after black women originally asked for assistance , said mit@@ ch@@ ell .
to mit@@ ch@@ ell , the up@@ s@@ well of white fem@@ in@@ ist responses to the issues raised by fer@@ g@@ us@@ on - police conduct , r@@ aci@@ al discrimination - reflect the times white fem@@ ini@@ sts have had to play &quot; catch up &quot; to issues black women have gra@@ p@@ pled with for generations .
&quot; w@@ oul@@ dn &apos;t it be great if the activi@@ sts who have those &#91; traditional fem@@ in@@ ist &#93; platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control ? &quot; posed mit@@ ch@@ ell .
second wave fem@@ ini@@ sts who made care@@ ers out of fighting for re@@ productive rights and access to birth control are now fi@@ gur@@ ing out what that means .
noted white fem@@ in@@ ist acti@@ vis@@ t gl@@ oria ste@@ ine@@ m took to fac@@ e@@ book two weeks after michael brown &apos;s sho@@ oting to post a pointed column by guar@@ dian colum@@ n@@ ist re@@ bec@@ ca car@@ roll that demanded more protest from white americans on the issue of racism .
&quot; i hope women , who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger that is located in the body - and r@@ aci@@ al opinions that are meas@@ ur@@ ably different in public po@@ lls - will lead the change , &quot; ste@@ ine@@ m wrote .
although ste@@ ine@@ m has v@@ ou@@ ched for a more inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ in@@ ism that includes issues of race as well as gender , her comments on race in america still pu@@ zz@@ le some .
american enterprise institute scho@@ lar christ@@ ina som@@ mers , author of &quot; who sto@@ le fem@@ in@@ ism ? , &quot; told she the people that young men in the united states , especially young men of color , are &quot; far more vulnerable than their si@@ sters , &quot; but ste@@ ine@@ m &apos;s remarks on fer@@ g@@ us@@ on counter the criticism she has launched in the past .
we now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women , but almost nothing for bo@@ ys .
but when the white house recently initiated a small program , my brother &apos;s ke@@ eper , to help vulnerable black and h@@ is@@ pan@@ ic young men , there was an an@@ gr@@ y reaction from many fem@@ ini@@ sts , including gl@@ oria ste@@ ine@@ m .
police relations with the black community is not the only issue pus@@ hing to the fore@@ front of main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism .
after u.s. border pat@@ rol ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ended nearly 6@@ 3@@ ,000 un@@ accompanied min@@ ors at the country &apos;s sou@@ th@@ west border this year , immigration reform sur@@ faced once again - this time as a women &apos;s issue .
andre@@ a mer@@ c@@ ado , co-@@ chair of we belong together , an organization mobili@@ zing women for immigration reform , said that in order to re@@ brand the issue as essential for women , all she needed to do was share immi@@ grant women &apos;s stories .
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; mer@@ c@@ ado said .
when the vast majority of employment vis@@ as are given to &#91; male immigrants &#93; , the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation .
&quot; these stories res@@ on@@ ate with women &apos;s organizations , &quot; she said .
ip@@ sw@@ ich &apos; pi@@ g in residence &apos; house for sale
a picture for a house for sale in suff@@ ol@@ k was removed by estate agents when it emerged it showed a large pi@@ g at rest in the living room .
on sale for £ 1@@ 20@@ ,000 , the de@@ t@@ ached one-@@ bedroom property s@@ its on a private road in ip@@ sw@@ ich .
the partic@@ ul@@ ars featured a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pi@@ g with its head re@@ sting on a set@@ tee .
estate agents conn@@ ell@@ s said the pi@@ g in the photo was the home owner &apos;s pet .
&quot; however , the photo was put up in error and has since been removed , &quot; a spo@@ kes@@ woman for the company said .
in the partic@@ ul@@ ars for the property , conn@@ ell@@ s described the former meeting house as a &quot; unique one bedroom de@@ t@@ ached house . &quot;
although the agency has removed the image from its website , it still appears in public@@ ity material .
the house sale has spar@@ ked interest on social media , where some have en@@ qui@@ red whether the pi@@ g is included in the sale .

the search is on for a new mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e in per@@ th &apos;s south-@@ west , with one lu@@ cky person taking home nearly $ 1.@@ 1 million from saturday night &apos;s lo@@ tto draw .
a har@@ ve@@ y news@@ agency struck gold in the division one draw for the second time in five years , the last being $ 1 million in november 2009 .
however the lu@@ cky winner has yet to come forward .
owner of the store ste@@ ve forward said the win was creating a bu@@ z@@ z around the small town in per@@ th &apos;s south west .
it &apos;s the talk of the town and everyone is pretty ex@@ ci@@ ted .
we thought a win like this might be close .
eight wa winners have celebrated division one win@@ s last month , cap@@ ping off a lu@@ cky few weeks for the state &apos;s players .
last week a can@@ ning val@@ e player became one of five august mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e &apos;s , following a bel@@ mon@@ t couple &apos;s massive $ 7.@@ 5 million win only a few weeks prior .
the winning couple had played the game for twenty years and said the win gi@@ fted them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new house .
the har@@ ve@@ y mil@@ li@@ on@@ air@@ e brings wa up to 59 division one winners for the year , tot@@ alling in nearly $ 85 million .
leon@@ id@@ as be@@ gged in the gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial arena
it was not only the gla@@ di@@ ators that stood an@@ k@@ le deep in the mu@@ d at the park during rhe@@ in@@ bach &apos;s first roman day .
the appeal of the event was so great that it attrac@@ ted more than 1000 visitors yesterday , who bra@@ ved the rain and autumn ch@@ ill , and who were completely taken in by the historical show .
there was a color@@ ful start with representa@@ tions , performances , games , exhibition pieces and information on roman times and their significance to the r@@ hin@@ eland .
the main attr@@ action of the day was undoubtedly the mar@@ tial arts group from the gla@@ di@@ ator school &quot; am@@ or mor@@ tis &quot; , which , every time it stopped ra@@ ining , se@@ ized the opportunity to demonstrate their robust mar@@ tial arts in the soft sand covered arena .
the owner of gla@@ di@@ ators &quot; leon@@ id@@ as &quot; proved himself to be a hum@@ or@@ ous and expert pres@@ enter , who sent men , one after one , into the ring for a her@@ o@@ ic du@@ el in a variety of gla@@ di@@ at@@ orial gen@@ res .
at first the &quot; pro@@ voca@@ te@@ urs &quot; were lined up with a rec@@ tan@@ gu@@ lar shi@@ eld and short s@@ word , as well a cuis@@ se on the left le@@ g , and a v@@ embr@@ ace on the right arm .
then there were the &quot; es@@ se@@ d@@ ari@@ i &quot; we@@ aring a bre@@ a@@ st-@@ plate , and carrying a short s@@ word and a spe@@ ar , as well as an iron gla@@ di@@ ator hel@@ met , a cuis@@ se and an arm guard .
what was particular impressive was the performance of the &quot; reti@@ ari@@ us &quot; , who went up against the &quot; secu@@ tor &quot; with a ca@@ st-@@ net , tri@@ dent and d@@ ag@@ ger , and who , after a short fight , kno@@ c@@ ked the gu@@ ys to the ground .
the s@@ words cl@@ ash@@ ed against one another , the shi@@ el@@ ds c@@ lan@@ ked and the spe@@ ars fle@@ w , zo@@ om@@ ing through the arena , so much so that you fe@@ ared for the safety of the gla@@ di@@ ators .
however , the gi@@ gan@@ tic &quot; sum@@ ma ru@@ d@@ is &quot; , a mus@@ cu@@ lar re@@ fe@@ ree , constantly kept a keen eye on them .
&quot; we wanted to revi@@ ve the roman everyday life , and enable the culture of roman times to be experienced &quot; , lo@@ ren@@ z e@@ us@@ kir@@ chen , the chairman of the events organization &quot; fre@@ un@@ desk@@ re@@ is r@@ ö@@ mer@@ kan@@ al &quot; explained as the intention behind the spectac@@ le .
cla@@ us we@@ h@@ age , the depu@@ ty may@@ or , announced in his welcome speech that after two years of preparation , the park was transformed for one day into an &quot; op@@ pi@@ dum roman@@ um &quot; , a roman city .
in the end , the roman@@ s not only brought war and con@@ quest to our region , but also the roman culture and numerous buildings , which we can still adm@@ ire today .
some of these remains could also be mar@@ vel@@ ed at during the roman day , such as &quot; ad@@ u@@ ä@@ du@@ k@@ t-@@ mar@@ m@@ or &quot; from the ele@@ ven@@ -@@ meter high , and 14@@ 00 meter long , roman canal bridge , which is the only one in l@@ ü@@ f@@ tel@@ berg .
the fron@@ tin@@ us organization compared , both then and now , the water and energy supply , and the managing director , pe@@ tra fr@@ ic@@ ke , said : &quot; we still deri@@ ve benefit today from the knowledge of back then &quot; .
this was confirmed by the surve@@ y@@ or r@@ alp@@ h he@@ ili@@ ger from &quot; ing@@ eni@@ eur@@ te@@ am@@ z@@ we@@ i &quot; in rhe@@ in@@ back , who introduced the instruments used by the roman@@ s for surve@@ ying , such as the ch@@ or@@ ob@@ at , gro@@ ma and di@@ op@@ tra .
the r@@ ö@@ mer@@ villa in blan@@ ken@@ heim presented s@@ ket@@ ches and models of the exc@@ av@@ ations of 18@@ 94 , as well as br@@ ic@@ ks made from the original hypo@@ ca@@ ust , for@@ ce@@ d-@@ air heating , which was once used to warm up r@@ ö@@ mer@@ villa .
the foot@@ prin@@ ts of a wol@@ f and fox from two thousand years ago were also impressive , and were left behind after they tro@@ d in cla@@ y before it was bur@@ nt .
in 2011 the office of archae@@ ological mon@@ ument conservation at the state association in rhe@@ in@@ land exc@@ av@@ ated the remains of a roman villa in an industrial estate in north rhe@@ in@@ bach .
the enc@@ losing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kil@@ n for dr@@ ying crops and mal@@ ting .
the building probably belong@@ ed to a villa rus@@ tic@@ a , an agricultural man@@ or , archae@@ o@@ log@@ ist dr. j@@ enni@@ fer mor@@ sche@@ is@@ er explained .
a range of finds from the exc@@ av@@ ation were presented in a glass cab@@ in@@ et , among which were a large plate , several fine glass j@@ ars and parts of a small nec@@ kl@@ ace .
mor@@ sche@@ is@@ er pre@@ sumed that the villa was there from between the first and fourth century an@@ no domin@@ i until the inv@@ asion of the german@@ ic people in the former roman rhe@@ in@@ land .
the children also kept themselves busy playing the roman wind@@ m@@ ills game , similar to today &apos;s m@@ ill game , or they wrote , as did the roman pu@@ pil@@ s at the time , their names with metal p@@ ens on wa@@ x tab@@ lets .
at the roman thermal bath stand from z@@ ü@@ l@@ p@@ ich , the children were allowed to lay mo@@ sa@@ ics themselves ; at the rhe@@ in@@ bach glass museum stand they made glass mo@@ sa@@ ics ; and at the ei@@ fe@@ l net@@ ter@@ sh@@ ei@@ m nature center stand , they got to use a heavy whe@@ at m@@ ill made of stone so they could gr@@ ind the fl@@ our needed for a pit@@ a bread or mu@@ es@@ li .
the visitors ro@@ de through the park in a roman carri@@ age , which had been re@@ constructed to be true to the original , and pul@@ led along by two cold blood horses , and also passed by the impressive city gym stand , where the results of their &quot; roman project week &quot; were revealed .
from 13 to 21 september , the community of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg will also participate in a roman week , in what is being called roman year 20@@ 14 throughout the r@@ hin@@ el@@ and@@ . the event will remember the death of ka@@ is@@ er au@@ gu@@ st@@ us 2000 years ago .
together with the clubs dedicated to local , regional and historical traditions and characteristics , as well as the w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg hiking club , the partnership association , and the ob@@ er@@ bac@@ he@@ m am@@ ate@@ ur dram@@ a@@ tics club , hiking , rec@@ it@@ als , cooking evening and guidance for school classes , among other things , will be offered , and the roman history of w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg shall be re@@ mem@@ bered .
the roman legi@@ on@@ na@@ ire will , for example , talk about his draf@@ ty work in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg ; plants will be presented as living monuments of roman times , and a hum@@ or@@ ous lesson on the matter of international understanding between a &quot; german@@ ic &quot; group from w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg and roman inv@@ ad@@ ers will be show@@ cas@@ ed .
ad@@ endor@@ f ele@@ mentary school has devoted itself to a wee@@ k-@@ long , roman@@ -@@ them@@ ed project .
the roman week should , once again , enable us to experience the numerous and common , yet , at first gl@@ ance , no longer visible , trac@@ es of the roman@@ s in w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg .
w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg town hall will give a small presentation on the sanc@@ tu@@ ary in ber@@ k@@ um , which was found in 18@@ 7@@ 9 .
e@@ bol@@ a : the ep@@ ide@@ mic is putting stra@@ in on west africa &apos;s economy
the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic in west africa is also a huge hit for the economy .
markets have been abandoned , and international companies are keeping their distance .
the dev@@ ast@@ ating e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic has dealt the economy in west africa a heavy b@@ low .
crops are ro@@ tting in the fields , mines have been deser@@ ted , and the markets have been aband@@ on@@ ed. the virus has cost the region de@@ arly .
even some international companies are keeping their distance .
&quot; the e@@ bol@@ a ep@@ ide@@ mic is not only a medical crisis , but also an economic one &quot; , the head of the african development bank , don@@ ald k@@ ab@@ er@@ u@@ ka , concluded .
liber@@ ia is the most affected country
&quot; it is a total catastro@@ ph@@ e ; we are losing a lot of money &quot; , al@@ ha@@ ji b@@ am@@ o@@ go said , who sel@@ ls clothes in the second largest market in liber@@ ia &apos;s capital city , mon@@ ro@@ via .
the only people to come to the market are those who want to buy food or dis@@ inf@@ ec@@ t@@ ant against e@@ bol@@ a .
liber@@ ia is the country most affected by the virus ; here alone more than 600 people have fallen victim to the fe@@ ver .
the health authorities recently explained that the disease has reached all cor@@ ners of the country .
the virus has even spread to gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and ni@@ geria .
in total , more than 15@@ 00 people have already died , and thousands more have been inf@@ ected .
foreign businesses are pul@@ ling their employees out
all over countries rich with resources , companies are sus@@ pending operations .
foreign companies such as the steel group ar@@ cel@@ or mit@@ tal are with@@ drawing their employees , and several international airlines are no longer flying to affected regions .
even local trad@@ ers and farmers are re@@ acting : only a few business people are still leaving their home towns to re@@ plen@@ ish their supplies .
in some areas of sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , where they have been put under quar@@ ant@@ ine , c@@ aca@@ o and coffee be@@ ans , to name a few , and which are important for export , are ro@@ tting in the fields .
the farmers do not d@@ are leave their homes for the crops .
food suppliers are scar@@ ce
&quot; people are trav@@ eling less and less &quot; , phil@@ li@@ pe de v@@ re@@ yer , a par@@ i@@ sian expert on the economy of west africa said .
for example , a man , who normally goes to the market and sel@@ ls his vegetables , is choosing to stay at home .
the population is , therefore , facing the consequences of the ep@@ ide@@ mic head on and feeling the pressure : food suppliers are scar@@ ce .
the supply of st@@ ap@@ le foods such as rice is d@@ wind@@ ling in the markets .
at the same time , the image of the region , which is heavily reli@@ ant on international companies , is under threat , and this has far-@@ reaching consequences .
the biggest danger is that international companies are avoiding the region for what is essentially a long time , phil@@ li@@ ppe hu@@ g@@ on , from the french think tan@@ k , ir@@ is , said .
what is crucial is how wide and how long the virus will continue to spread .
investors may get the impression &quot; that it is dangerous to live in gu@@ ine@@ a , sier@@ ra le@@ one and liber@@ ia , and , therefore , also to invest &quot; , hu@@ g@@ on war@@ ned .
the disease is also bur@@ d@@ ening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the states
the disease is also bur@@ d@@ ening the already stra@@ ined national budgets of the affected states .
the rating agency mo@@ o@@ dy &apos;s fears that their budgets are being heavily stra@@ ined by the high expenditure on the health system , and also by the dec@@ lining economy .
the african development bank has already promised to provide financial aid to the tun@@ e of 60 million dollars ( 45 million euros ) to the health systems of affected countries .
the effects in ni@@ geria , where up to now only a few e@@ bol@@ a cases have been diagno@@ sed , are already notic@@ eable .
yet the o@@ il@@ -@@ rich region in the south of the ni@@ ger del@@ ta is not yet affected .
however , elsewhere , many people are already staying at home for fear of becoming inf@@ ected .
there is even a marked decline in the number of hotel reservations .
sho@@ ot@@ ers are celebr@@ ating their 50@@ th anniversary

the highlights on sunday will be the festival service , which will take place at 9 : 30@@ am in the par@@ ish church , and also the proc@@ essions at 2@@ pm .
there will also be a ran@@ king announcement in the afternoon for the national and county sho@@ oting competition .
a particularly attractive sight will be the 25 festival women in their dir@@ n@@ d@@ ls .
the festival band will be bern@@ ga@@ u br@@ ass band .
may@@ or wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g wild and state secretary al@@ bert fü@@ r@@ ack@@ er have taken on the spon@@ sor@@ ship .
the original name , &quot; sch@@ ü@@ tz@@ eng@@ es@@ ell@@ schaft t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u &quot; ( gun society t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d bern@@ ga@@ u ) dates back to 19@@ 07 , when , on 21st march , the club was founded and described as &quot; social entertainment by means of pi@@ st@@ ol and small@@ -@@ cali@@ ber target practice &quot; .
in 19@@ 37 the na@@ zi regime closed the club down .
then on 30@@ th april 196@@ 4 , 19 young men founded the club again , and launched the &quot; new &quot; gun club &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ wal@@ d &quot; in bern@@ ga@@ u at lu@@ k@@ as guest@@ -@@ house .
kar@@ l m@@ ä@@ r@@ z and ad@@ ol@@ f ried led the club as range officers during its tough early year@@ s. the main objective then was to find a club pu@@ b and set up a sho@@ oting company .
as early as autumn 196@@ 5 the sho@@ oting club started out in &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; guest house with two teams compe@@ ting against one another .
the following year , target sho@@ oting was set up as a sport , organized into seven teams , ranging in ability , all the way up to the local premier league .
the club records roll out every year , and the magic 3@@ 80 roun@@ ds were set up for the first time in 1980 by ru@@ di me@@ i@@ er .
just as the achievements of the active members has increased , so have the number of members .
once the club pu@@ b &quot; le@@ in@@ inger &quot; no longer met the requirements of a modern gun club , the club &apos;s management at the time , lead by jo@@ han@@ n r@@ inn , decided to set up its future home in the bas@@ ement room of the new &quot; land@@ gas@@ th@@ of h@@ ä@@ r@@ te@@ is &quot; ( a country hotel ) .
after 27@@ 00 hours of hard work , father str@@ ass@@ er issued the bl@@ essing of the church for the new gun@@ s room on 8@@ th may 198@@ 8 .
one of the greatest highlights in the history of the club was without doubt the 4@@ 4th local sho@@ oting competition , which is linked to the formal con@@ sec@@ r@@ ation of the new sho@@ oting flag in july 1991 .
on 23@@ rd and 24@@ th april 1994 , the sho@@ oting club celebrated its 30@@ th anniversary .
in 1995 the can@@ non group was founded .
jo@@ se@@ f sch@@ mal@@ z@@ l was the head of the can@@ non division .
organiz@@ ing the bav@@ arian can@@ non meeting in 2005 was a huge challenge for the &quot; can@@ non sho@@ ot@@ ers &quot; , and for the club as a whole .
many hours of voluntary work was dedicated by members of the club last year to moder@@ ni@@ ze the rooms and sho@@ oting facilities in the bern@@ ga@@ u cour@@ ty@@ ard , making it state of the art .
ele@@ ven teams go head to head
the sporting achievements of the sho@@ oting club are also impressive .
currently there are a total of ele@@ ven teams that are taking part in the competi@@ tions : six air ri@@ f@@ les teams , one pel@@ let gun team , one k@@ k@@ 1 sport target pi@@ st@@ ol team , one youth team and two ol@@ d-@@ tim@@ er teams .
the first team comp@@ ris@@ ed of lars ell@@ rich , k@@ ath@@ ar@@ ina ell@@ rich , ste@@ ff@@ i gra@@ d and ker@@ sti@@ n k@@ ell@@ er@@ mann was promoted to number 1 in the regional league in 2013 / 14 , up from the local premier league ( the highest of the sho@@ oting le@@ ag@@ ues in the an@@ b ) .
the second team comp@@ ris@@ ed of ve@@ ren@@ a mo@@ os@@ bur@@ ger , alex@@ and@@ ra me@@ i@@ er , eva sch@@ u@@ h@@ mann and to@@ bi@@ as gram@@ l was promoted from the north local league to the local premier league .
in addition to sho@@ oting , events such as bo@@ ck@@ ste@@ chen , fas@@ ching and kö@@ ni@@ gs@@ ball , club excursions and also christmas celebra@@ tions are all club traditions .
the sho@@ ot@@ ers also attend the par@@ ish and community festi@@ vals .

&quot; i went into today with some pretty good hopes of finishing well , &quot; jo@@ hn@@ ston said , adding , &quot; it just didn &apos;t work out . &quot;
not long after the second cr@@ ash , ste@@ w@@ art &apos;s car was loaded onto the ha@@ ul@@ er and the team was packed up and ready to leave .
ste@@ w@@ art ski@@ pped three nas@@ car spr@@ int cup rac@@ es after his car struck and killed a fellow driver in a dir@@ t-@@ track race in up@@ state new york .

nato will not break their agreements with russian as a result of their planned dep@@ loy@@ ment to east europe in response to the ukra@@ inian crisis .
in brussels on monday , the secretary general of nato , and@@ ers fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen , said that nato will ad@@ here to the nat@@ o-@@ russia council formation agreement of 1997 .

r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen also announced that he wants to strengthen the presence of nato in east europe .

according to official data , russia and ukraine have agreed to new talks to set@@ tle disputes over gas .
the negotiations have been scheduled to take place next saturday , the russian minister of energy , alexander no@@ wa@@ k , said on monday .

mer@@ kel puts her foot down : &quot; let &apos;s be clear &quot; , tol@@ ls will come
once again the chancell@@ or makes her@@ self clear .
however , there is still no charter expla@@ ining all the complex details .
sti@@ ff opposition from the c@@ du against the tol@@ ls is making the c@@ su increasingly ang@@ ri@@ er .
following persi@@ stent opposition from the c@@ du , the chancell@@ or of germany , ang@@ ela mer@@ kel , has put her foot down with regard to the introduction of tol@@ ls .
&quot; let &apos;s be crystal clear : they are mentioned in the coalition agreement , and we will have them &quot; , the party leader said on monday following a c@@ du party conference with top committees in berlin .
but mer@@ kel has not , for the time being , established a detailed model .
&quot; certain parameters &quot; were mentioned in the black@@ -@@ red government program .
the minister of transport , alexander do@@ br@@ in@@ dt ( c@@ su ) &quot; made a suggestion , and we are continuing to work on it &quot; .
the n@@ w-@@ c@@ du , however , is insi@@ sting that tol@@ ls on all streets be objec@@ ted against .
mer@@ kel stressed that even the minister of finance , wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble ( c@@ du ) , is participating construc@@ tively in the consul@@ tations on the draft bill .
he has spoken with do@@ br@@ in@@ dt on the topic and about further possibilities for cap@@ itali@@ zing more and investing more in infrastructure , such as developing broad@@ band .
&quot; there is nothing special about it &quot; . on sunday , sch@@ ä@@ u@@ ble let an article in the spi@@ e@@ gel pass without comment , which stated that his house is testing its own concept for compens@@ ating motorway investors with returns on the tol@@ ls - after the 20@@ 17 election .
as a result , the leader of the c@@ su , hor@@ st see@@ ho@@ fer , war@@ ned about developing tol@@ l concepts in the cab@@ in@@ et against the minister in charge .
the depu@@ ty leader of the c@@ du , arm@@ in las@@ ch@@ et , rein@@ forced his objec@@ tions .
&quot; the coalition agreement never assumed that all district and a-@@ roads would get tol@@ ls &quot; , the state chairman for north r@@ hin@@ e-@@ west@@ ph@@ alia said .
the fact that see@@ ho@@ fer has now announced that he will discuss this topic again is an important sign .
opposition to the plans has also been received from the c@@ du state association in bad@@ en-@@ w@@ ür@@ t@@ tem@@ berg and r@@ hin@@ el@@ and-@@ pal@@ at@@ in@@ ate .
this is due to concerns that a tol@@ l would have a negative impact on small@@ -scale border traffic to neighbor@@ ing states .
see@@ ho@@ fer has demanded loy@@ alty to the coalition following criticism of the tol@@ ls from members of the c@@ du .
die lin@@ ke ( the lef@@ ties ) are considering the plans a failure given the argu@@ ing within the union .
&quot; the mess@@ ed up tol@@ l is dead &quot; , ber@@ nd ri@@ ex@@ inger , the party leader , told the &quot; neu@@ en os@@ n@@ ab@@ r@@ ü@@ ck@@ er ze@@ it@@ ung &quot; ( newspaper ) on monday .
&quot; if the tol@@ l fails , the minister fails &quot; . do@@ br@@ in@@ dt wants to introduce an obligation to have tol@@ l labels on all german streets as of 20@@ 16 .
according to the coalition agreement , car owners in german must not , however , have to face additional charges .
as such , road tax should be off@@ set against tol@@ ls for them .
according to eu law , however , the model must not dis@@ advantage foreign drivers due to their nation@@ ality .
genetic dis@@ order often mis@@ diagno@@ sed
a british woman says she spent many years thinking she was going to die after a mis@@ diagno@@ sis .
kar@@ in ro@@ d@@ gers spent most of her te@@ en@@ age life believ@@ ing that she only had years to live after she was diagno@@ sed with another disease .
she actually had char@@ cot@@ -@@ mari@@ e-@@ to@@ oth disease ( c@@ mt ) - a group of in@@ h@@ eri@@ ted dis@@ orders that damage ner@@ ves outside the brain and sp@@ ine .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk said that mis@@ diagno@@ sis is a common problem among people with c@@ mt because so little is known about the condition .
about 23@@ ,000 people in the uk are thought to have c@@ mt , which can cause motor symp@@ t@@ oms such as mus@@ cle weak@@ ness , an aw@@ k@@ ward ga@@ it and cur@@ led to@@ es .
suff@@ e@@ rers can also experience num@@ b@@ ness or pain and the condition is incur@@ able and progressive , meaning symp@@ t@@ oms get worse over time .
when ro@@ d@@ gers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from fried@@ re@@ ich &apos;s at@@ ax@@ ia ( fa ) - a condition which had a very poor prog@@ no@@ sis .
ro@@ d@@ gers thought that she was going to be whe@@ el@@ chair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 3@@ 0s .
the mo@@ ther@@ -of-@@ two , who is now 51 , said : &quot; as a child i knew i cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t do the same things as others .
i was falling daily and everything took me longer to do .
i could never roll@@ er-@@ sk@@ ate or sk@@ ate@@ board with other kids and got bul@@ lied at school a lot because of the way i wal@@ ked and ran .
ro@@ d@@ gers said when she was aged 13 , after several operations to release her ach@@ ill@@ es tend@@ ons and stra@@ i@@ gh@@ ten out her feet , she took a peak at her medical notes when her consult@@ ant left the room which said that she suffered from fa .
&quot; i felt guil@@ ty because i &apos;d been no@@ sy and so i didn &apos;t tell any@@ body , but i did come home , look up the condition at the library and wrote to the fa association , &quot; she said .
when i got the information back i was go@@ b@@ sm@@ acked and in the worst state of pan@@ ic possible .
i thought i &apos;d be in a whe@@ el@@ chair at 18 and dead by the time i was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability .
i was going through this on my own and i planned my own fun@@ eral .
she said by the time she reached 17 she re@@ alised that her walking abilities h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t deterior@@ ated as much as she thought they would have and asked her sur@@ ge@@ on about it .
he just stood up and hu@@ gged me and said &apos; my dear i don &apos;t think you have it , as you would be in a whe@@ el@@ chair now . &apos; 
i think you have something a lot less life threat@@ ening .
after some genetic testing she was found to have c@@ mt .
&quot; when he explained what c@@ mt was , i thought i &apos;d drawn the lu@@ cky stra@@ w , &quot; she said .
char@@ ity c@@ mt uk has launched c@@ mt awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition .
reti@@ red ser@@ ge@@ ant major ber@@ ni bi@@ e@@ ther has been working as an arti@@ fic@@ er ever since the closure of the former military training ground
not a shot has been fi@@ red in the former military training ground in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en for almost ten years .
nevertheless , dead@@ ly am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion turns up in the center of the bio@@ sphere region of sw@@ ab@@ ian jur@@ a every month .

the last live round to be fi@@ red at the military training ground in m@@ ün@@ sing@@ en was in december 2004 , which , at the end of 2005 , after 1@@ 10 years of military operation , was closed down .

wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area business owners &quot; tax burden moun@@ ts as economy re@@ b@@ ounds
a re@@ boun@@ ding economy means more customers , higher sales and new jobs .
it also means higher taxes .
state and local tax b@@ ills for companies across the country grew mode@@ stly last year as the economic recovery acceler@@ ated , according to new research released last week , and wash@@ ing@@ t@@ on-@@ area firms were no exception .
district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a businesses collec@@ tively paid $ 2@@ 7.@@ 6 billion to state and local coff@@ ers in fiscal 2013 , an increase of 3.@@ 8 percent over the $ 2@@ 6.@@ 6 billion collected in 2012 .
businesses &quot; state and local tax bur@@ dens last year expanded by 4.@@ 3 percent , to $ 6@@ 71 billion , compared with 3.@@ 9 percent the year before , and it was the third con@@ secu@@ tive year of growth after back@@ -to-@@ back years of shr@@ in@@ king b@@ ills in 2009 and 2010 .
state taxes rose at a faster cli@@ p , 4.@@ 3 percent , than local le@@ vi@@ es , 3.@@ 9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by professional services firm ern@@ st &amp; young and the center on state taxation , a tax policy group .
more than half of the district &apos;s tax revenue , 56 percent , comes from business taxes , while 36 percent of mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s revenue comes from firms .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , at 28 percent , gener@@ ates the least amount of tax revenue , proportion@@ ately , from business .
much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a re@@ bound in companies &quot; real estate values , researchers say , which pus@@ hed property taxes up 3.@@ 7 percent this year after three con@@ secu@@ tive years of sub-@@ 1 percent growth .
while a large share of those gains came from big states such as california , new york and tex@@ as , it appears to be the same story in the washington area as well .
companies in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a collec@@ tively for@@ ked over $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year , up from $ 9.@@ 6 billion in 2012 - year-@@ over-@@ year growth of 4.@@ 2 percent .
but the apparent boun@@ ce@@ back in property values isn &apos;t doing nearly as much to infl@@ ate state and local tax revenues in mar@@ y@@ land , where property taxes amount to bare@@ ly more than a fifth of companies &quot; tax b@@ ills .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a and d.@@ c. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax b@@ ills in the form of property taxes .
&quot; what &apos;s happening in mar@@ y@@ land is that so much of their property , especially the tax base surrounding the d.@@ c. area , is owned either by the government or by non@@ profits , which don &apos;t pay property taxes , &quot; said dou@@ gl@@ as lin@@ d@@ holm , executive director of the center on state taxation .
so mar@@ y@@ land is forced to rely much more heavily on , for example , its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states .
the recent re@@ bound in business tax revenue cannot all be attribu@@ ted to the reco@@ vering real estate market .
business in@@ comes also appear to be on the m@@ end , according to the data .
companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $ 2.@@ 3 billion , up from $ 2.@@ 1 billion in 2012 .
mar@@ y@@ land collected $ 1 billion in corporate income tax revenue , the most in the region .
while tren@@ ding in the same direction , the local tax burden on businesses isn &apos;t growing at the same pace in all three places .
the district &apos;s rate of growth was level with the national average , at 4.@@ 3 percent , while mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s growth was substantially faster at 4.@@ 9 percent .
only vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a posted a be@@ low-@@ average tax bill bu@@ mp of 4.@@ 1 percent .
vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a has the lowest corporate income tax by far of the three juris@@ dic@@ tions ( all of which have flat corporate rates ) at 6 percent .
mar@@ y@@ land &apos;s corporate rate is 8.@@ 25 percent , while the district &apos;s stands at a relatively high 9.@@ 9@@ 75 percent .
a similar study by the u.s. chamber of commerce earlier this year showed that vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a had lower state and local business taxes and an overall better business tax climate than mar@@ y@@ land .
the district was@@ n &apos;t evalu@@ ated in the study .
despite its advantage , vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a is facing competitive pressure from its neighb@@ or to the south .
north car@@ ol@@ ina recently signed legislation low@@ ering its corporate rate this year from 6.@@ 9 percent to 6 percent , in line with vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year .
if the state continues to meet revenue goals in the coming year , the law could push the state &apos;s business income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 20@@ 17 .
meanwhile , small businesses in the washington region seem to be f@@ aring better and thus paying more state and local taxes , according to the recent study .
business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass@@ -@@ through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the district , mar@@ y@@ land and vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a sur@@ ged 20 percent last year to $ 2.@@ 4 billion , a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes .
researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nation@@ wide are likely to continue this year , with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.@@ 2 percent in the first three quarters of 20@@ 14 compared with the same period last year .
however , the washington area may la@@ g behind as the slow@@ down in federal spending takes its tol@@ l on the region &apos;s labor market .
twin town : german beer for gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u
ho@@ ps and mal@@ t - a popular combination even in china .
german beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in china .
frankfurt &apos;s twin town in china would like a bre@@ w@@ ery , and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities .
german beer bre@@ wed in frankfurt &apos;s twin town of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u - that is the burning desire of the chinese officials .
&quot; we would be delighted if a german bre@@ w@@ ery would set up business in our city &quot; , the depu@@ ty party secretary of the southern chinese city , li yi@@ we@@ i , said this week during a visit to the city by an sp@@ d deleg@@ ate .
time and time again throughout the con@@ vers@@ ation , the official of the ruling communist party in china came back to this wish of the twelve million people metro@@ polis .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , which is also known as can@@ ton in germany , is one of the rich@@ est cities in china li adver@@ ti@@ sed .
so , the people also have the buying power to afford german beer .
the hes@@ sian sp@@ d chairman thor@@ ste@@ n sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel , who led the german delegation , said to the host that he would keeps his e@@ ars open in germany for a possible partner .
&quot; you don &apos;t need a lot to make beer : good water , gra@@ in and a z@@ est for life &quot; , he added over lunch with the senior party member in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u .
this z@@ est for like already be@@ ams out of mr li , he said fl@@ at@@ tering the host .
after that , the official from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u clic@@ ked gl@@ asses with sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel - albeit with red wine , which was served with dinner .
the chinese brand t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o has trac@@ es leading back to the german art of bre@@ wing .
t@@ sing@@ ta@@ o beer is bre@@ wed according to the german pur@@ ity law .
more business operations
a second wish of the chinese host would be a direct flight connection between frankfurt and gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , the depu@@ ty party leader , li , said .
lu@@ f@@ than@@ sa used to offer such a flight , but can@@ cel@@ ed it for economic reasons in 2012 .
&quot; it would be worth it again &quot; , the local politici@@ an seemed convinced .
&quot; the business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow &quot; .
at present , travel@@ ers would have to take a de@@ tour via chan@@ g@@ sh@@ a in the province of hun@@ an , li compla@@ ined .
the administration of the province of gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong , whose capital city is gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , is also ho@@ ping for a flight connection .
the depu@@ ty govern@@ or of the province , chen y@@ un@@ xi@@ an , emphasi@@ zed this wish during his talks with the social democr@@ at .
&quot; that is a very good idea &quot; , sch@@ ä@@ fer@@ -@@ g@@ ü@@ m@@ bel answered - the chinese depu@@ ty minister , li j@@ in@@ ju@@ n , an in@@ timate expert on germany , no@@ d@@ ded in agreement .
well-@@ cultiv@@ ated partnership
the aff@@ able depu@@ ty party leader of gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u hopes to visit frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting .
li yi@@ we@@ i has already been to the main , but not in the capacity of his role .
he only took up office this year after his pre@@ dec@@ essor was removed from office over corruption alleg@@ ations .
even the party leader of the region , wan q@@ ing@@ lian , had to leave .
the action taken against the officials from gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u is part of the nation@@ wide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration , which was rigor@@ ously implemented by the head of state , x@@ i j@@ in@@ ping .
before his career in politics , the new senior politici@@ an , li yi@@ we@@ i , worked for an american company , which is highly unusual in the chinese communist party .
before taking office in gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , he was working as a senior official in fu@@ j@@ ian , where car manufacturer v@@ w has built a large factory .
frankfurt has officially adopted more than a do@@ zen twin cities .
gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u , one of the twin cities located some 9@@ 000 kilometers away , is a connection that will be well looked after and cher@@ ished by both sides ; for example , with a school exchange .
last year marked the 25 year of german@@ -@@ chinese relations .
the south china metro@@ polis , which lies on the pe@@ ar@@ l river , is almost as strong as the whole of h@@ ess@@ en thanks to its economic power .
next year they would like to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros , li reported .

amaz@@ on bu@@ ys t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion
amaz@@ on just confirmed what the information reported monday morning : the online re@@ tail@@ er - and video producer , and a hundred other things - is buying video stre@@ aming service t@@ wit@@ ch for $ 1.@@ 04 billion ( $ us@@ 9@@ 70 million ) .
the announcement comes as a surprise , not because no one expected t@@ wit@@ ch to be bought , but because you@@ tube was widely expected to be the buyer .
three months ago the sale of t@@ wit@@ ch to google &apos;s video service , for a cool billion , looked all wra@@ pped up , and the pa@@ iring seemed natural .
t@@ wit@@ ch , founded only three years ago as ju@@ st@@ in@@ .@@ tv , set out to be a general stre@@ aming service - a live version of you@@ tube .
instead , it quickly became a platform for gam@@ ers to broad@@ cast their in-@@ game feat@@ s ; a &quot; you@@ tube for live gaming , &quot; in business in@@ sid@@ er &apos;s words .
t@@ wit@@ ch &apos;s interface .
and &quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; a gen@@ re of videos in which wis@@ e@@ ac@@ res give ( mostly older ) games the myster@@ y science theater treatment , are already popular on you@@ tube .
the point is , you@@ tube comes up a lot when descri@@ bing t@@ wit@@ ch , so the news that you@@ tube was acqu@@ iring t@@ wit@@ ch was gre@@ e@@ ted with a y@@ a@@ wn , a tex@@ t@@ book example of an ent@@ ren@@ ched tech company buying out a potential competi@@ tor .
it &apos;s a myster@@ y why the deal with you@@ tube fell through , considering it was re@@ porte@@ dly willing to pay no less than amaz@@ on .
all we have at the moment is this statement from t@@ wit@@ ch ceo em@@ met@@ t she@@ ar : &quot; we chose amaz@@ on because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term vision , and they want to help us get there faster . &quot;
another myster@@ y , frank@@ ly , is t@@ wit@@ ch &apos;s incredible success .
to s@@ no@@ bs like me who declare that they &apos;d rather play sports than watch them , it &apos;s hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself .
it &apos;s one thing to look over your friend &apos;s shoul@@ der at 3 in the morning as she cre@@ eps through resid@@ ent evil , and quite another to watch some ran@@ do get 20 head@@ sho@@ ts in a row in call of duty .
all the games you could be watching right now .
another problem is that many of today &apos;s most popular games are first-@@ person , so watching foot@@ age of them , without controlling the view@@ point yourself , can be a do it right-@@ worthy reci@@ pe for a head@@ ache .
i conce@@ de that spe@@ ed@@ runs , in which the ro@@ ger ban@@ ni@@ sters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time , are enter@@ taining .
but unless someone is a virtu@@ o@@ so at gaming or hum@@ our , his t@@ wit@@ ch channel isn &apos;t likely to be all that interesting .
but what do s@@ cep@@ tics like me know ?
t@@ wit@@ ch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the four@@ th-@@ largest source of peak internet traffic .
how , exactly , will amaz@@ on cap@@ ital@@ ise on this ?
it &apos;s hard to imagine t@@ wit@@ ch being fol@@ ded into amaz@@ on inst@@ ant video as eleg@@ antly as you@@ tube could have just s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed t@@ wit@@ ch .
but t@@ wit@@ ch has something any company would love to attract : hor@@ des of adver@@ ti@@ ser@@ -@@ co@@ ve@@ ted young men .
as t@@ wit@@ ch chief she@@ ar said , amaz@@ on and t@@ wit@@ ch &quot; are both beli@@ ever@@ s in the future of gaming , &quot; and the medium shows no sign of shr@@ in@@ king , even - gul@@ p - as a spec@@ t@@ ator sport .
something is happening on the boun@@ cy castle at the bur@@ gg@@ ar@@ ten@@ fest ( castle garden festival ) .
the organiz@@ ers &apos; idea was right .
despite the heavy down@@ pour of rain on saturday evening , approximately 1@@ 200 music fans went to the open air festival in the castle garden .
admission had to be stopped on occasion .
&quot; it was an@@ no@@ ying &quot; , according to ron se@@ m , one of the organiz@@ ers .
salz@@ we@@ del lights and fun .
ma@@ xi@@ m s@@ ach@@ ra@@ j and ron se@@ m co@@ ined the name &quot; ar@@ mul@@ a &quot; from two spanish words .
since the open air castle garden in salz@@ we@@ del was supposed to be@@ am out bright lights during the wide range of day@@ time and evening shows .
well , you make your own fun anyway .
this was already apparent early on saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air .
the organiz@@ ers promised a festival fit for all generations .
and that is what they delivered .
around the supplies stand located in the me@@ ado@@ ws of the castle garden , people from salz@@ we@@ del , but also guests from near and far , made themselves at home .
they followed the first live performance , ta@@ pped their feet in time , and enjoyed refres@@ h@@ ment@@ s. in short : pure relaxation and enjoy@@ ment .
and that goes for all generations .
whilst some people sp@@ ra@@ w@@ led out on blan@@ kets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar , which had been car@@ ted in especially , others in@@ dul@@ ged in a glass of wine in the wine store , and the kids went cra@@ zy on the boun@@ cy castle , which was a huge attr@@ action for the little guests .
however , even the children &apos;s face painting kept the volunte@@ ers &apos; hands full , in the stric@@ test meaning of the word , as the children rus@@ hed to become men , and con@@ j@@ ure up f@@ anci@@ ful cre@@ ations on their small faces .
the more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a sk@@ ate@@ board workshop , which the good@@ foot@@ -@@ crew from salz@@ we@@ del had organized .
and then the rain came .
shortly before 5 : 30 pm the rain pel@@ ted down onto the visitors ; and families did a run@@ ner in search of some@@ where dry .
despite this , the festival &apos;s attractions did not get called off .
&quot; more people than expected came &quot; , rom se@@ m said , who called the event a &quot; success all round &quot; .
as such , nothing is going to stop them from repe@@ ating the big party next year .
even though more has to be done in terms of the size and content of the event , the first balance sheet done on sunday made the voice of the people crystal clear for se@@ m .
he said that one an@@ no@@ ying thing was that they had to stop allowing entry into the event tempor@@ arily .
apparently not enough security guards had been booked with the security company .
the consequence : some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds .
feedback has been very good .
in a preliminary and cau@@ tious es@@ tim@@ ation , the salz@@ we@@ del co-@@ organiz@@ er estimated that around 1@@ 200 visitors attended the castle garden .
there were problems with the sound engineering .
the hi@@ p hop band from salz@@ we@@ del , blocks &apos; n &apos; ro@@ x , abandoned their performance somewhat un@@ ner@@ ved by these problems .
the engineers could not get a half-@@ decent sound out of it .
a sh@@ ish@@ a lounge had been planned but could not be built because the t@@ ents could not be delivered to salz@@ we@@ del due to a pun@@ c@@ ture .
the organiz@@ er insi@@ sted that &quot; they will , however , be there next year &quot; .
the premier of the am@@ u@@ la@@ -@@ open-@@ airs was more than a success in terms of the number of visitors .
and that was with bad weather .
nevertheless , the organiz@@ ers have made some mistakes , which will be exc@@ used as it was their first time , but which have to be avoided next time round .
the event organiz@@ ers also had to accept criticism on the social net@@ working site fac@@ e@@ book .
&quot; sorry , but for twelve euros , i really expected more &quot; , mel@@ ani@@ e me@@ i@@ er comm@@ ented on the event &apos;s page .
&quot; unfortunately , you bit off more than you could che@@ w &quot; , according to e@@ le zim@@ mer@@ mann on the same page .
for others , the te@@ e@@ thing problems were not such a big issue .
i think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rub@@ b@@ ish , but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running .
h@@ ats off ! &quot; , ste@@ ph@@ ani@@ e jen@@ ß wrote about am@@ ula .
now the organiz@@ ers have a year &apos;s time to address these critic@@ isms .
new rad@@ ar d@@ ome in ber@@ k@@ um : w@@ ach@@ t@@ berg &apos;s land@@ mark d@@ wind@@ les
and not as one would expect .
in fact , the structural element , which is ready , is waiting to be installed onto the structure .
but this is just one of many things that need doing : almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation rad@@ ar ti@@ ra , the case , known as the rad@@ ar d@@ ome , is to be completely re@@ built .
with a di@@ ameter of 4@@ 7.@@ 5 meters , the new rad@@ ar d@@ ome will be somewhat smaller than the old one .
that said , the size will still be a world record .
the final phase in comple@@ ting the new case is to change the cap
the top quarter of the old case will be separated and lif@@ ted by a cr@@ ane .
after that , the last quarter of the new case will be put in place .
as long as the weather is on their side , this should take place at the start of this week .

will the bur@@ g@@ vere@@ ine ( castle clubs ) get back together again ?
recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the boar@@ d@@ room is now con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating the possibility of working together .
as an example for the reconstruction of the castle in wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en , the dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath , the former chair@@ men of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ user bur@@ g@@ fre@@ un@@ de ( wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle friends ) , led the project in the french gu@@ é@@ del@@ on .
up until a year ago , there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
their points of view are now marke@@ dly different with regard to how the history of wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled .
now the two are coming together : there should soon be talks about a joint venture .
tor@@ ste@@ n s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg ( castle club ) and her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l ( castle friends ) , both members of the board , confirmed this in answer to our newspaper &apos;s query .
&quot; i have run@@ g mr pi@@ ff@@ l and suggested that we get together &quot; , s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg reported .
in his opinion , all members of each club could come together again in the future .
this would enable quick@@ er and more visible success to be achieved .
whereas the castle friends , and the recently dec@@ eas@@ ed richard di@@ mb@@ ath right up until the bit@@ ter end , had their eyes on re@@ construc@@ ting the castle in the mountain forest , the castle club , with s@@ j@@ ö@@ berg , want to &quot; develop and bring the premises to life &quot; in its original place .
her@@ bert pi@@ ff@@ l , the depu@@ ty chairman of castle friends , said himself that he was very pleased about the call .
he has been presid@@ ing over castle friends since the death of di@@ mb@@ ath .
a new chair@@ person will be found mid september during a members &apos; meeting .
at the moment , the club has around 40 members according to the 74 year old .
&quot; after the death of my friend , richard di@@ mb@@ ath , we ad@@ jour@@ ned the club &apos;s activities initially out of respect &quot; . this &quot; period of thought &quot; has been necessary to &quot; think about how it can proceed &quot; .
according to pi@@ ff@@ l , the new chair@@ person will then enter into discussions with the castle club .
until then , the castle friends can get on with the current atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic picture within their group .
pi@@ ff@@ l said that , at the moment , they still do not have a candidate for the chair .
&quot; however , i am confident that we will find someone &quot; . he himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in bad t@@ ö@@ l@@ z .
the new chair@@ person should be in wol@@ fr@@ at@@ sha@@ us@@ en .
the man from t@@ ö@@ l@@ z would , however , &quot; like to continue working with them &quot; on the project .
the different points of view on the subject of reconstruction will continue to exist for some time in pi@@ ff@@ l &apos;s eyes .
he acknowled@@ ges di@@ mb@@ ath as a &quot; mis@@ sion@@ ary &quot; , who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle .
two similar projects , which are well under way in austria and france , show that this idea is no easy task .
but with a high number of participants among the population , as well as some volunte@@ ers from all over the world , it will become a tourist mag@@ net .
pi@@ ff@@ l : &quot; even i was ske@@ p@@ tical at first .
however , with time , i have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project &quot; . it could create a &quot; unique characteristic &quot; for the city of ra@@ ft@@ sm@@ en .
otherwise , there is nothing here .
in addition , the project would be financed by eu grants , visitor tickets and potential spon@@ sors , pi@@ ff@@ l believes .
&quot; the idea of reconstruction is , therefore , something that i personally do not want to simply aband@@ on. he hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat .
their aim to first of all document the history &quot; is important and good &quot; .

with the cost of college tex@@ t@@ books sur@@ passing $ 1@@ ,000 a year for many students , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be s@@ op@@ hom@@ ore mat@@ t sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der came up with a smart way to tri@@ m costs .
he worked out a system of bor@@ ro@@ wing books from up@@ per@@ class@@ men , offering nom@@ inal compensation to get them to delay selling them back .
&quot; my calcul@@ us book that usually costs $ 18@@ 0 , i got for the sem@@ ester for $ 10 and a ch@@ ick@@ -@@ fil@@ -@@ a bis@@ cu@@ it , &quot; says sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der , 19 , who atten@@ ds co@@ ven@@ ant college in georgia .
required texts for his last sem@@ ester would have cost $ 4@@ 30 , he says .
he spent $ 120 .
the college board says the average student will spend more than $ 1,@@ 200 a year on tex@@ t@@ books and school supplies , but students have a variety of options for managing these costs .
online out@@ lets and creative approaches like sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &apos;s are increasingly the go@@ -@@ to choices for students .
ren@@ ting tex@@ t@@ books is on the rise , allowing students to use a book for the sem@@ ester , often at a significant discount to buying .
nee@@ bo inc , which operates more than 250 camp@@ us book@@ stores , says tex@@ t@@ book rent@@ als have doub@@ led since 2011 .
industry research shows that about one-@@ fourth of books at college book@@ stores in this past spring sem@@ ester were ren@@ ted , says nee@@ bo vice president tre@@ v@@ or me@@ yer .
fewer than half of all texts are purchased at camp@@ us book@@ stores , according to the national association of college stores trade association .
here is the 10@@ 1 on the best ways to score a deal .
buying online
some new book prices can be one-@@ third of what you might find at the camp@@ us book@@ store if you go online .
the n@@ in@@ th edition of &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; by ron lar@@ son , bru@@ ce ed@@ wards , and robert hoste@@ t@@ ler carri@@ es a list price of nearly $ 2@@ 90 but can be purchased new for $ 23@@ 9.@@ 99 at speci@@ alty tex@@ t@@ book re@@ tail@@ er che@@ gg@@ .@@ com@@ .
buying used
if you do not mind other people &apos;s notes or wear and te@@ ar , used texts are a good option .
&quot; calcul@@ us &quot; is selling for $ 9@@ 3.@@ 49 used on che@@ gg@@ .@@ com@@ .
mat@@ t cas@@ ad@@ ay , 25 , a senior at bri@@ g@@ ham young university , says he had paid 42 c@@ ents on amaz@@ on@@ .com for a used copy of &quot; strategic media decisions : understanding the business end of the advertising business . &quot;
the book was selling for $ 48 new .
aca@@ dem@@ ics like ing@@ rid br@@ ac@@ ey , director of the university of mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts at am@@ her@@ st &apos;s college without walls , suggest students check with their prof@@ ess@@ ors to see if previous edi@@ tions are acceptable .
sometimes the updates are not relevant to the class@@ work .
if so , old edi@@ tions can often be found for a tiny fr@@ action of the cost of the latest version .
besides che@@ g@@ g and amaz@@ on , e@@ bay inc &apos;s hal@@ f@@ .com is a popular alternative for used books .
ren@@ ting
ren@@ ting your tex@@ t@@ books is worth considering if you take reasonable care of them , you remember to return them and you do not care to own them after you complete the class .
you can save more than 80 per cent of the cost of buying a book new .
for example , a student could rent &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for the length of the sem@@ ester for about $ 20 .
know the rules of the store you rent from , including any penalties you could be assess@@ ed for taking notes , highligh@@ ting , or wear and te@@ ar .
ren@@ ter , be@@ ware : if you fail to return the book , penalties can actually exceed the cost of buying it new .
e-@@ books
getting e-@@ books instead of traditional texts is another option .
sometimes those books are essentially ren@@ ted by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distribu@@ tors such as amaz@@ on@@ .com , che@@ g@@ g and bar@@ nes &amp; no@@ ble inc .
che@@ g@@ g will rent &quot; calcul@@ us &quot; for six months for about $ 61 .
br@@ ac@@ ey says students in literature classes can often find the best bar@@ gains since many classi@@ cs are now available to download for free , while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive .
no matter what , shop around .
jo@@ e ga@@ ult , 29 , who is about to enter pe@@ p@@ per@@ d@@ ine law school , recomm@@ ends using the is@@ b@@ n number to price books since it ensures you are shopping for the right text .
before or@@ dering online , ga@@ ult says , be sure to check if the book is actually in stock .
he learned that lesson the hard way .
a book he purchased was back@@ -@@ ordered for four weeks , and he ended up paying full price at the college book@@ store .
why the guar@@ di@@ ans of the gal@@ ax@@ y cou@@ l@@ dn &apos;t save the box office
sy@@ l@@ ves@@ ter st@@ all@@ one &apos;s the expend@@ ables 3 has made back less than $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the us , while s@@ in city : a d@@ ame to kill for has made back only $ 12 million of its $ 70 million budget .
the camer@@ on di@@ a@@ z vehicle sex tape took only $ 14@@ .@@ 6 million in its opening weekend , while children &apos;s films such as how to train your drag@@ on 2 are also showing dis@@ appoin@@ ting box office returns .
an article from te@@ leg@@ raph film cri@@ tic rob@@ bi@@ e col@@ lin indicates that , when it comes to children &apos;s movies , the poor quality of the films themselves might be to blame .
col@@ lin called 20@@ 14 the &quot; the worst &quot; year yet for children &apos;s films , and described how to train your drag@@ on 2 as a merely &quot; functional &quot; fant@@ as@@ y sequ@@ el .
but when it comes to film pit@@ ched at a slightly older market , it appears that the issue might not necessarily lie with the quality of the films themselves .
in july , entertainment weekly compared the average cinem@@ as@@ core and met@@ ac@@ ri@@ tic rat@@ ings for every summer release playing on at least 2@@ ,000 scre@@ ens between may &apos;s mem@@ orial day holiday and july 20 , for 2013 and for this year .
the results , which take the opinion of both cinema audi@@ ences and film cri@@ tics into account , suggest that this year &apos;s cro@@ p of films are of similar cali@@ bre last year &apos;s h@@ its .
some comm@@ ent@@ ators have suggested that changing viewing hab@@ its and the increased popul@@ arity of web stre@@ aming services such as net@@ f@@ li@@ x may be to blame .
director j@@ on fav@@ re@@ au , who is currently working on dis@@ ney &apos;s forthcoming jun@@ g@@ le book film , told the website ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; i think times are changing . &quot;
we have to acknowledge that and not try to ch@@ ase what used to be .
in contrast to ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood &apos;s current box office s@@ lu@@ mp , net@@ f@@ li@@ x recently saw revenue from its stre@@ aming content service reach $ 1.@@ 2@@ b@@ n , almost dou@@ bling last year &apos;s figure of $ 8@@ 3@@ 7@@ m .
last summer , director ste@@ ven spi@@ el@@ berg critic@@ ised studios for rel@@ ying too much on com@@ ic book fran@@ ch@@ ises , and predic@@ ted a ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood &quot; mel@@ t@@ down . &quot;
in light of the current down@@ turn , some comm@@ ent@@ ators are argu@@ ing that his di@@ re pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y may have held some truth to it .
with summer 20@@ 15 set to us@@ her in a s@@ late of potential big box office h@@ its , including av@@ eng@@ ers : age of ul@@ tr@@ on , mini@@ ons and jur@@ as@@ sic world , other figures within the film industry are feeling more optim@@ istic .
x-@@ men producer sim@@ on kin@@ berg recently described the drop in box office tak@@ ings as simply &quot; cy@@ clic@@ al , &quot; telling ho@@ ll@@ y@@ wood re@@ porter : &quot; next summer will be the biggest bo@@ x-@@ office summer in history , and nobody will be worrying about the business . &quot;
a few years ago , when the second table tennis regional division was can@@ cel@@ ed in an attempt to stre@@ am@@ line the le@@ ag@@ ues , a step in the right directions was taken .
now , the german table tennis association has introduced an additional , third league into the program .
the consequence : any team that has not been promoted , has been demo@@ ted .
for example , g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen &apos;s top class team , tor@@ pe@@ do , avoided demo@@ tion in the premier league re@@ leg@@ ation , but will now play in the fifth division as of next season .
the tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s women &apos;s team remain in the fourth division despite their superb clean@@ -@@ s@@ wee@@ p in the regi@@ on@@ al@@ lig@@ a .
the tor@@ pe@@ do bo@@ ys and girls are starting in the lower sa@@ x@@ ony lig@@ a , just like the l@@ ads from s@@ c we@@ en@@ de .
the s@@ g leng@@ ler@@ n and tor@@ pe@@ do reserves are ste@@ pping up into the new ver@@ band@@ s@@ lig@@ a , but there are no longer any clubs from g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ing@@ er@@ n in the land@@ es@@ lig@@ a .
for the women , tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar does play in the ver@@ band@@ s@@ lig@@ a , and the tor@@ pe@@ do &apos;s second team plays in the land@@ es@@ lig@@ a .
from a structural point of view , this seems to be a better regional division , when in fact , it is just the new southern regional premier league .
ste@@ pping up into this are : ts@@ v s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en , v@@ f@@ b l@@ ö@@ d@@ ing@@ sen , tor@@ pe@@ do iii , ge@@ is@@ mar , ein@@ bec@@ k , ham@@ men@@ ste@@ dt , bo@@ ven@@ der sv , lan@@ gen@@ hol@@ ten@@ sen , f@@ c w@@ es@@ er and tt@@ c .
d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ d and s@@ c we@@ en@@ de represent the area in the regional league , whereas tt@@ c ii , ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß , bo@@ ven@@ der sv ii and tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii and iii represent the area in the regional divi@@ sion@@ . the regional premier league for women is at least kic@@ king off with a good start .
g@@ ün@@ ter@@ sen , tt@@ c and tt@@ v ge@@ is@@ mar ii are all here as part of the party .
in the regional league , tor@@ pe@@ do iii and s@@ atten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en are taking to the field .
with each of the nine teams
s@@ c we@@ en@@ de sen@@ ds a girl into the small regional league .
even the regional league &apos;s rela@@ y team for sc@@ w bo@@ ys , which is where tor@@ pe@@ do ii is also starting , is not complete .
as for the regional division , ge@@ is@@ mar , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and bo@@ ven@@ der sv are heading into their season .
in the first season of the new@@ ly-@@ founded regional association , both district divi@@ sions from g@@ ö@@ tt@@ ingen are starting out with each of the nine teams .
as for the west rela@@ y team ; that is made up of ro@@ t-@@ wei@@ ß ii , bo@@ ven@@ der sv iii , lau@@ bach ii , tor@@ pe@@ do iv and v , m@@ tv gr@@ one , d@@ ran@@ s@@ fel@@ der s@@ c ii , mi@@ el@@ en@@ haus@@ en and s@@ g leng@@ ler@@ n ii .
s@@ atten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en , ni@@ ko@@ la@@ us@@ berg and land@@ ol@@ f@@ sha@@ us@@ en are some of the teams making up the east rela@@ y team .
the women &apos;s district division is made up of s@@ atten@@ haus@@ en / w@@ ö@@ ll@@ mar@@ sha@@ us@@ en ii , bil@@ sha@@ us@@ en , hem@@ el@@ n , s@@ eu@@ ling@@ en ii , tus@@ po we@@ en@@ de and s@@ g r@@ hu@@ me .
that is much better than the district of o@@ ster@@ o@@ de , where there are no longer any female teams at a district level .
it is remarkable that none of the six second division teams in the district achieved their poten@@ ti@@ al. the innovative and bu@@ st@@ ling district committee are going to have to come up with something .
nato summit : first pro@@ tests in new@@ port and car@@ di@@ ff
there have been pro@@ tests over the weekend by those opposed to the nato summit in new@@ port .
on saturday , hundreds gathered in new@@ port city centre for an anti-@@ nato march .
and on sunday in car@@ di@@ ff , around 150 people came together at car@@ di@@ ff &apos;s county hall for what was described as a counter@@ -@@ summit .
ste@@ ph@@ en fair@@ cl@@ ough has been following developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to prote@@ sters who have travell@@ ed from brid@@ g@@ end to belgium .
te@@ ens air@@ lif@@ ted from blue mountains
two te@@ en@@ age bus@@ h@@ wal@@ kers have been win@@ ched to safety after spending the night str@@ an@@ ded in the n@@ s@@ w blue mountains .
the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ old girl and 18@@ -@@ year-@@ old man went hiking just after mid@@ day on sunday at go@@ ve@@ t@@ ts lea@@ p in black@@ he@@ ath .
concerned rela@@ tives called police about 8@@ pm when they h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t returned home .
a search party involving local police and rescue squ@@ ad was sent out and the pair were found about 11@@ pm near brid@@ al ve@@ il falls .
the girl had in@@ ju@@ red her k@@ ne@@ e and the man had fallen and hit his head .
officers remained with the pair over@@ night and they were win@@ ched out on monday morning .
they were taken by am@@ bul@@ ance in a stable condition to blue mountains hospital .
anti-@@ government pro@@ tests es@@ cal@@ ate in pakistan
around 1000 prote@@ sters have been forced out of the p@@ tv buildings by soldiers , according to the minister of information , per@@ v@@ ai@@ z r@@ as@@ hi@@ d .
after a good half an hour or so , the station began broad@@ casting again .
the director of p@@ tv , ath@@ ar far@@ o@@ o@@ q , said that demonstr@@ ators armed with stic@@ ks had damaged equipment in the ed@@ it@@ orial offices .
there was no mentioned of the number of people killed or in@@ ju@@ red .
the demonstr@@ ators are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the head of government , acc@@ using him of vote ri@@ gging .
the police announced that on monday , around one kil@@ ome@@ ter away from the residence of the prime minister , na@@ wa@@ z shar@@ if , approximately 3@@ 000 demonstr@@ ators cl@@ ash@@ ed with security forces .
according to statements released by the hospital , a police officer was in@@ ju@@ red .
at least three people were killed and more than 500 in@@ ju@@ red at the weekend when demonstr@@ ators attemp@@ ted to gain access to shar@@ if &apos;s residence .
they are demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of the prime minister .
following a meeting in the army &apos;s headquarters on sunday evening , the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict , st@@ ating there was &quot; no time to waste or a need to use violence &quot; .
the statement also announced that : &quot; the army remains bound by its duty to ensure the safety of the state &quot; .
the es@@ cal@@ ating violence sti@@ r@@ red up concern that the military may have to intervene , a military that has already re@@ vol@@ ted on many occasions in the past .
the above pro@@ tests , led by im@@ ran kh@@ an , an opposition politici@@ an , and ta@@ h@@ ir@@ u@@ l q@@ ad@@ ri , a pre@@ ach@@ er , have been ongoing since independence day on 14 august .
shar@@ if is ref@@ using to step down .
on sunday kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri called upon their sup@@ porters to per@@ severe .
&quot; we will not leave until we have forced shar@@ if to resi@@ gn &quot; , kh@@ an said .
q@@ ad@@ ri made similar comments :
kh@@ an acc@@ uses shar@@ if of having frau@@ dul@@ ently won the parliamentary vote last may .
q@@ ad@@ ri is demanding the re@@ sign@@ ation of both the central and provin@@ cial governments .
a provi@@ sional government should then reform the voting system , and call new elections .
more than 4@@ 0,000 members of the security forces have been deplo@@ yed to protect the government district .
at first , the demonstr@@ ators led a peaceful protest in front of the parliament buil@@ d@@ ing. then , at the weekend , kh@@ an and q@@ ad@@ ri called upon them to force entry into shar@@ if &apos;s residence .
after its second win of the season , h@@ ü@@ t@@ tel@@ dorf is in third place on the table .
a bit@@ ter week came to an end for rapid on sunday with a 2 : 0 win over gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g .
co@@ ach z@@ or@@ an b@@ ari@@ sic , whose team reached an interim low at the end of the euro@@ pa league on thursday , said that &quot; the victory is very liber@@ ating &quot; .
the captain and go@@ al@@ ke@@ eper , ste@@ ff@@ en ho@@ f@@ mann , who clim@@ bed up to third place with gr@@ ün@@ -@@ wei@@ ß , confirmed that &quot; the sense of achievement was extremely important &quot; .
sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l &apos;s dream goal has led rapid on to a road to vic@@ tor@@ y. two winning seas@@ ons show that rapid have re@@ acted in the right way to the dis@@ appointment experienced against hel@@ sin@@ ki , and they reach the end of the international season with hei@@ ghten@@ ed mor@@ ale .
&quot; we wanted to show a positive reaction &quot; , the def@@ en@@ der thomas sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l said , whose magnificent and sk@@ ill@@ ful corner in the 14@@ th minute set them on a winning course .
&quot; i thought i &apos;d build up all of the fru@@ stration from thursday , and sm@@ ash@@ ed it into the top of the net &quot; , the 2@@ 6-@@ year old said s@@ mil@@ ing .
13@@ th of november 2010 was , until now , the last time that sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l had sco@@ red in a team from the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a , and that was with ried .
his first champion@@ ships goal at rapi@@ d-@@ d@@ ress will , therefore , always be a special memory for him .
&quot; that is something quite special for me , i am rapid off@@ spring &quot; , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l said .
due to mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic &apos;s recent pel@@ vis in@@ jury , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l moved from playing left back to right back , where he also did a very good job .
he had enough experience to be able to play in the mir@@ ro@@ red position .
he deser@@ ved the goal , b@@ ari@@ sic state@@ d. he has already achieved some assi@@ sts this year .
the team shows character@@ . sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l also cros@@ sed the ball over to ho@@ f@@ mann after the first hour , which led to the decisive 2 : 0 victory .
but before that , even the fans could have kept the score .
&quot; thank god we had some lu@@ ck today &quot; , sch@@ ram@@ me@@ l noted , al@@ lu@@ ding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks : &quot; the results were not justified , but the games were always better when compared to last year &quot; .
b@@ ari@@ sic even decided that the team had previously played &quot; better in other games than today &quot; , and against &quot; the strong@@ est team to play in the sta@@ dium this season &quot; .
these are the first three points since 26@@ th july , and therefore prove that the structure of the team is int@@ act despite the set@@ backs : &quot; today , my team has shown that they have character &quot; .
for him , what is just as pleas@@ ing is : &quot; the fact that we have finally played to a clean sheet again &quot; .
a lot of work was done during the internal football break@@ . the unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence of bri@@ an beh@@ ren@@ dt , mari@@ o pa@@ ve@@ lic , chri@@ stop@@ her di@@ bon , den@@ i al@@ ar and michael sch@@ imp@@ el@@ s@@ ber@@ ger , as well as the fact that s@@ r@@ d@@ jan gra@@ ho@@ va@@ c , ste@@ fan stan@@ gl and phili@@ p@@ p sch@@ ob@@ es@@ ber@@ ger joined the first team , is what makes this success all the more valuable .
&quot; we must not forget that &quot; , b@@ ari@@ sic said , who has lost players in the last three days , including beh@@ ren@@ dt and pa@@ ve@@ lic , &quot; who recently were very stable &quot; .
the international football break therefore has to be used &quot; to lic@@ k w@@ ounds and to improve physi@@ cally a bit &quot; , b@@ ari@@ sic explained , who has five under 2@@ 1@@ s in his ran@@ ks .
for one of whom , captain ho@@ f@@ mann , the break came in particularly useful .
he ben@@ ds over back@@ wards for the team , ign@@ oring any pain .
especially during these difficult times , he showed that he is a very important player for us &quot; , b@@ ari@@ sic stated .
before being substitu@@ ted in the 6@@ 8@@ th minute , ho@@ f@@ mann not only gave structure to rapid &apos;s game , but also sco@@ red the second goal .
for the 3@@ 3-@@ year old , who played his 3@@ 50@@ th game in the bun@@ des@@ lig@@ a , it was his first goal since november 2 , 2013 ( 4 : 2 against admir@@ a ) .
ho@@ f@@ mann : &quot; we must not think that all is now well &quot; . &quot; i am sure we had a bit of lu@@ ck on our side , but , at some point , that lu@@ ck had to come back to us .
it was high time &quot; , ho@@ f@@ mann said .
of course , he spoke about focused and continued work : &quot; you don &apos;t have to always see things black and white .
we haven &apos;t been playing as badly in recent weeks as it has been made out to be .
however , we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think that all is now well .
his importance to the team is something that he could not deny .
after all , it is a very young team , which , i am able to help at the moment .
they hold on to me in certain ph@@ ases &quot; , ho@@ f@@ mann said .
gr@@ ö@@ di@@ g &apos;s co@@ ach , michael bau@@ r and his team have little to blame themselves for .
he is sorry about the quick counter goal , descri@@ bing it as &quot; a kind of magic goal &quot; , as well as the normal goal sco@@ red by n@@ ut@@ z in the 40@@ th minute , which was wr@@ ong@@ fully denied by the re@@ fe@@ ree , k@@ ol@@ leg@@ ger .
the only criticism i can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough up@@ field .
because we had far to few goals .
center back , maxim@@ ili@@ an kar@@ ner thought the same : &quot; it started off badly , but we then found our feet , and even sco@@ red a goal .
all in all , we could have had more .
silence prevail@@ s bene@@ ath this tre@@ e@@ top
last friday , when giving out the pu@@ zz@@ le on the summer series &quot; my piece of rh@@ ö@@ n happ@@ iness &quot; , we showed a mi@@ gh@@ ty tree tr@@ un@@ k .
there are still several of these giant trees in the region ; the example shown is the &quot; ge@@ iss@@ ru@@ he@@ ic@@ he &quot; , an o@@ ak tree , which stands above the village of un@@ ter@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n .
a ro@@ cky foot@@ path leads up to the somewhat 600 year old o@@ ak tree .
you walk past enc@@ lo@@ sures , bas@@ alt ca@@ ir@@ ns and a sea of stones .
the tree is located just below the bau@@ er@@ s@@ berg &apos;s stone quar@@ ry , one kil@@ ome@@ ter north of the street to we@@ is@@ bach .
the natural mon@@ ument looks ener@@ ge@@ tic ; it to@@ wers above the other trees in the area , and , being more than eight meters in size , it remin@@ ds you of an american giant sequ@@ o@@ ia .
a small bud@@ d@@ ha on top of a tree stu@@ b indicates that this is a spiritual or my@@ stic place .
despite intensive research , there are only clu@@ es to the origin@@ s of the name .
dr wol@@ f@@ gan@@ g sch@@ nei@@ der has , once again , consulted the bis@@ ch@@ of@@ sh@@ ei@@ m archi@@ ves , and asked elderly people from un@@ ter@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n in order to find out what it has to do with the ge@@ iss@@ ru@@ he@@ ic@@ he .
the results of his investigation revealed a less color@@ ful explanation of the name .
according to his research , up to around 80 years ago , the go@@ at her@@ ders are said to have led their animals out of un@@ ter@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n along the ar@@ du@@ ous , cle@@ ared and st@@ on@@ eless me@@ ado@@ ws .
the her@@ d@@ sm@@ en , exhaus@@ ted after the as@@ cent , rested at the foot of the tree .
since then , the area has won back its significance , because her@@ ds of go@@ ats , once again gra@@ zing the me@@ ado@@ ws .
in addition , sch@@ nei@@ der also discovered that the region has been declared the core area in the bio@@ sphere reserve .
one should exercise cau@@ tion when tre@@ ading over the mass of stone because the sun@@ -@@ war@@ med bas@@ alt is also a popular where@@ ab@@ outs for the european vi@@ per .
a hiking trail leads from un@@ ter@@ we@@ is@@ sen@@ brun@@ n up to the tree , but it is somewhat hidden .
further trails are sign@@ posted , which lead up towards ho@@ ch@@ rh@@ ö@@ n and offer an extensive hi@@ ke .
where is the mo@@ ated castle ?
a mo@@ ated castle , which we looked for as part of our next challenge , is , of course , rather hard to find way up high .
the reflection in the mo@@ at already provides a good impression of the structure , but we do have some historical buildings in the district , and the building por@@ tra@@ it may just be a good example of this .
where is our &quot; piece of rh@@ ö@@ n happ@@ iness &quot; ?

after weeks of ver@@ bal w@@ ran@@ g@@ ling italy &apos;s premier - and sitting eu-@@ chairman - mat@@ te@@ o ren@@ zi , has managed to push through his nom@@ ination of his foreign minister , feder@@ ica mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , as head of eu@@ - foreign policy , despite strong conservative opposition at the special eu sum@@ mit@@ . she will be the success@@ or of the britain , ca@@ ther@@ ine ash@@ ton .
ren@@ zi observ@@ es how the govern@@ ment@@ -@@ friendly daily newspaper , la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a , describes the appointment of mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who was also seen as the favourite by the government , as a strengthening of the position of the social democrats and of his own position in the eu .
he exp@@ ects it to provide a boost for his &quot; reform package &quot; in italy .
ren@@ zi hopes , not least , to be able to thus qui@@ e@@ ten the lef@@ t-@@ wing party basis which is always sti@@ r@@ ring against him , for mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini is considered to be one of their group - albeit one of the more moderate .
in opposition to the conservative representatives , commission president je@@ an-@@ cla@@ ude jun@@ ck@@ er and the po@@ le don@@ ald tus@@ k , who was named as council president , were voted in , so the prevail@@ ing opinion in rome , in order to achieve a political balance .
for the chief diplom@@ at of the eu will also serve as the depu@@ ty to commission president jun@@ ck@@ er .
the agreement of the eu-@@ parliament is considered to be safe@@ ly secured .
if this were not the case , then state president gi@@ or@@ gio na@@ polit@@ ano would hardly have called the nom@@ ination of the 41 year-@@ old politici@@ an from the ruling democratic party ( p@@ d ) &quot; an important recognition &quot; of the role of italy in the eu .
la re@@ pub@@ b@@ lic@@ a is optim@@ istic that mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini , who has held high office over two decades in different governments , and who is known for her ambition , will be able to meet the &quot; enormous challenges &quot; .
the woman , who was born in rome , is married and has two dau@@ gh@@ ters .
the qualified doctor of political science began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the former democra@@ tic@@ i di s@@ ini@@ stra ( left wing democrats ) , which mer@@ ged with the catho@@ lic centre party , mar@@ gh@@ er@@ ita , in 2008 , to form today &apos;s social democratic party ( p@@ d ) .
in 1999 mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini became vice president for three years of the european community organization of socialist youth .
the election of 2001 saw her take high office with a place on the council of the left wing democrats , working in the foreign policy department and then becoming its head .
she was responsible for traditional cor@@ ner@@ stones of italian foreign policy such as the middle east ; became known for her prepar@@ atory work to the operation of nato in afghanistan , in which italy has a participating cont@@ ingent ; and she promoted relations with the social democrats in europe and with the democrats in the usa .
since 2008 she has been a member of the chamber of depu@@ ties , in which she serves as an expert on defence and european and international affairs .
when ren@@ zi became premier in february 20@@ 14 , he appointed mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini as his foreign minister .
if the p@@ d today enjoys a better relationship with the strong freedom movement in the country , which contributed to the more than 40 percent votes for the party in the eu elections , then it was feder@@ ica mo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini who played a leading role in that , as is strongly believed in p@@ d cir@@ cles .
the claims in brussels that the new eu-@@ foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience and therefore l@@ acks cl@@ out , is re@@ but@@ ted by the p@@ d .
in brussels , the realistic stance taken by lo@@ gh@@ er@@ ini in the ukra@@ inian crisis have been att@@ acked and den@@ i@@ gra@@ ted , particularly by the polish members and those representing the baltic states .

france &apos;s socialists should &apos; sh@@ ut up and sort france out &apos; , fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de &apos;s key ally says
mr v@@ alls called on the deeply divided left to &quot; show its aff@@ ection &quot; for the emb@@ att@@ led socialist president , whose res@@ hu@@ ff@@ le has failed to meet the approval of the vast majority of french .
the president deserves everyone &apos;s respect , he deserves our loy@@ ality , he deserves our support .
&quot; it is our duty to remain at his sides , &quot; he said , to applause .
as a plac@@ atory ge@@ st@@ ure , the prime minister insi@@ sted his government would not call into question france &apos;s controversial 3@@ 5-@@ hour working week , despite infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory suggestions it should relax the rules earlier in the week by em@@ manu@@ el mac@@ ron , the new economy minister .
on saturday , mr hol@@ lan@@ de had imp@@ lo@@ red his fellow socialists to remain &quot; united &quot; with the government .
but christi@@ ane tau@@ bir@@ a , the justice minister , put a span@@ ner in the works by turning up to a meeting of re@@ bel socialist m@@ ps and critic@@ ising the socialist party for le@@ tting the french &quot; lose faith in their future . &quot;
marine le pen , the far-@@ right national front leader , he@@ ap@@ ed s@@ cor@@ n on the socialists &apos; constant in-@@ fighting by saying she did not see the new v@@ alls government lasting more than just a few months .
fran@@ co@@ is hol@@ lan@@ de the emper@@ or has no clothes , but neither has prin@@ ce manu@@ el v@@ alls , forced to put together a new government when the previous one didn &apos;t even survive the summer .

she reiter@@ ated her party &apos;s call for a parliamentary dis@@ solution , saying she was confident it could win early elections and stood ready to gover@@ n .
france &apos;s ruling party suffered a dru@@ b@@ bing in march municip@@ al elections and the far-@@ right national front came out on top in eu elections in may .

hong kong pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts hec@@ k@@ le china official day after vote ruling
a group of beijing loy@@ alists stood nearby w@@ av@@ ing china &apos;s flag .
the n@@ pc standing committee on sunday endor@@ sed a framework to let only two or three candidates run in hong kong &apos;s 20@@ 17 leadership vote .
all candidates must first obtain majority backing from a nom@@ in@@ ating committee likely to be st@@ acked with beijing loy@@ alists .
the decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the bal@@ lot promp@@ ted pro-@@ democracy activi@@ sts to re@@ new their vo@@ w to bring hong kong &apos;s financial hu@@ b to a hal@@ t with &quot; occup@@ y central &quot; pro@@ tests .
political reform has been a major source of tension in hong kong , with china party leaders fe@@ ar@@ ful of calls for democracy spre@@ ading to other cities .
following the publication by beijing of a white paper out@@ lining china &apos;s authority over hong kong in june , democracy activi@@ sts held an un@@ official referendum on voting in the special administrative region , and hundreds of thousands mar@@ ched to the city &apos;s business district and st@@ aged a sit@@ -@@ in .

putin demands ki@@ e@@ v open &apos; state@@ hood &apos; talks with eastern ukraine
russian president v@@ la@@ di@@ mir putin demanded sunday that the ukra@@ inian government ce@@ ase batt@@ ling separ@@ ati@@ sts in the country &apos;s east and immediately begin negotiations on the break@@ away region &apos;s &quot; state@@ hood , &quot; according to russian news accounts of his remarks .
his spo@@ kes@@ man , d@@ mit@@ ry pes@@ ko@@ v , later clari@@ fied that putin didn &apos;t mean to imp@@ ly that the eastern ukra@@ inian territory under separ@@ ati@@ st control would become part of russia , but that its status within ukraine had to be revised to give the rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests .
but putin &apos;s call upon the ki@@ e@@ v government to negotiate with the pro-@@ russia insur@@ g@@ ents as equ@@ als correspon@@ ded with the apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five months ago : help the separ@@ ati@@ sts take territory and force the ukra@@ inian government to grant the newly proc@@ laim@@ ed nov@@ or@@ os@@ si@@ ya region virtual independence to ali@@ gn with russia instead of the west .
in an interview with state@@ -@@ run channel one television , putin den@@ oun@@ ced the ukra@@ inian military campaign to recover separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held territory in the eastern don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions that were se@@ ized in march and april , after moscow anne@@ xed ukraine &apos;s cri@@ mean peninsula on march 18 .
the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ sts have la@@ tely bran@@ ded the se@@ ized territory &quot; nov@@ or@@ os@@ si@@ ya , &quot; or &quot; new russia , &quot; a term that har@@ k@@ ens to pre-@@ revolutionary gl@@ ory days of the russian empire .
putin said that anyone who believed peace talks are in the off@@ ing as ukra@@ inian politicians launch campaigns for an oc@@ t . 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are att@@ acking civilian communities in separ@@ ati@@ st-@@ held regions is &quot; a prison@@ er to illu@@ sions , &quot; it@@ ar@@ -@@ t@@ ass reported .
&quot; we must immediately comm@@ ence substan@@ tive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the state@@ hood status of sou@@ the@@ ast ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there , &quot; he said .
pes@@ ko@@ v said putin &apos;s reference to state@@ hood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that has been discussed for months with the ki@@ e@@ v leadership as it strugg@@ les to al@@ lay fears in the rus@@ si@@ an-@@ speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger .
only the ukra@@ inian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy , pes@@ ko@@ v said .
it &apos;s not a matter to be negotiated between ukraine and russia , pes@@ ko@@ v said , &quot; because it &apos;s not a conflict between russia and ukraine , but an internal ukra@@ inian conflict . &quot;
the kre@@ m@@ lin spo@@ kes@@ man &apos;s inter@@ c@@ ession to correct the &quot; mis@@ interpretation &quot; of putin &apos;s remarks under@@ sco@@ red the russian leadership &apos;s approach to dealing with the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ bel@@ lion in the east differently from its ou@@ tri@@ ght se@@ iz@@ ure of cri@@ me@@ a , where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic russian .
moscow would have a much more difficult fight to annex even the don@@ et@@ sk and lu@@ han@@ sk regions of eastern ukraine , as most of the 6.@@ 5 million residents are not russian and pre-@@ conflict po@@ lls showed broad support for staying within ukraine .
the autonomy that russian diplom@@ ats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations , effectively han@@ ding the kre@@ m@@ lin de fac@@ to control over territory that would link the russian main@@ land with cri@@ me@@ a .
the black sea peninsula anne@@ xed five months ago is home to russia &apos;s main na@@ val fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts .
the regions between russia &apos;s ro@@ sto@@ v area and cri@@ me@@ a are also home to mines , fac@@ tories and foun@@ dri@@ es that produce vital components for the russian military .
ukra@@ inian president pe@@ tr@@ o por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko proposed during his in@@ aug@@ ur@@ ation speech on june 7 that ukra@@ inian law@@ makers - after new elections -- wei@@ gh constitutional amendments to give more control to the dispar@@ ate regions over their finances and the status of languages .
but his vision of autonomy appears to differ shar@@ p@@ ly from that of the kre@@ m@@ lin and the separ@@ ati@@ st re@@ be@@ ls moscow is accused of arm@@ ing and in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating .
putin &apos;s latest call on ki@@ e@@ v to deal with the separ@@ ati@@ st leaders as equ@@ als followed new adv@@ ances by the re@@ be@@ ls last week after russian troops and tan@@ ks entered eastern ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the sea of az@@ ov .
the rus@@ si@@ an-@@ backed separ@@ ati@@ sts took control of the town of no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk in a drive that ukra@@ inian security officials say they fear is the opening of a campaign to se@@ ize the strategic coastal territory all the way to cri@@ me@@ a .
that has sp@@ ur@@ red a massive civilian and military effort to for@@ ti@@ fy mari@@ u@@ pol , a ste@@ el@@ making port of 5@@ 00@@ ,000 that lies between no@@ vo@@ az@@ ov@@ sk and the narrow ga@@ te@@ way into the cri@@ mean peninsula .
por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko on saturday addressed a meeting of european union leaders in brussels to urge action to prevent further russian aggres@@ sion against ukraine , a former soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years .
&quot; we are close to the point of no return , &quot; por@@ o@@ sh@@ en@@ ko war@@ ned .
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tan@@ ks are now on the territory of ukraine .
the eu summit took no defini@@ tive action ; the leaders called for drafting more pun@@ ishing sanctions on russia to be imposed in the event of an un@@ specified es@@ cal@@ ation of the ukraine crisis .
ukra@@ inian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in il@@ ov@@ ay@@ sk after two colum@@ ns of russian arm@@ or and 1@@ ,000 troops last week moved into the don@@ et@@ sk region to bol@@ ster the be@@ le@@ agu@@ ered separ@@ ati@@ sts , col@@ . and@@ ri@@ y ly@@ sen@@ ko , spo@@ kes@@ man for the ukra@@ inian national security and defense council , told re@@ porters in ki@@ e@@ v on saturday .
the first of a reported 63 ukra@@ inian soldiers who were tr@@ app@@ ed in il@@ ov@@ ay@@ sk by the russian incur@@ sion were sw@@ app@@ ed sunday for 10 russian par@@ at@@ ro@@ op@@ ers cap@@ tured inside ukra@@ inian territory a week ago , ly@@ sen@@ ko said sunday .

tin@@ sel@@ town is re@@ eling after a series of explicit photos showing a nu@@ de j@@ enni@@ fer law@@ rence hit the internet in a major celebr@@ ity h@@ acking scand@@ al .
the h@@ ack@@ er responsible is said to have 60 nu@@ de photos of hun@@ ger games star law@@ rence and super@@ stars including models k@@ ate up@@ ton and car@@ a de@@ lev@@ ing@@ ne , sing@@ ers ri@@ h@@ anna , ari@@ ana gran@@ de and le@@ a mic@@ hel@@ le and actors kir@@ ste@@ n dun@@ st .

there are 10@@ 1 celebr@@ ity names on the list .
e@@ del@@ ste@@ n , who proposed to g@@ rec@@ ko last month , told confid@@ ential : &quot; it &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting &quot; .
all private correspon@@ dence and images should remain private .
it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful that personal information can be sto@@ len and dis@@ pers@@ ed to others .
g@@ rec@@ ko , who is in new york , re@@ porte@@ dly told a news website the h@@ acking was &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful &quot; and those targeted would &quot; feel vio@@ lated . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ er is believed to have 30 images of pal@@ mer with ex@@ -@@ bo@@ y@@ friend scot@@ t spe@@ ed@@ man , including two fr@@ ames where she is loun@@ ging top@@ less in a pool .
pal@@ mer &apos;s film cred@@ its include love and hon@@ or , opposite li@@ am hem@@ s@@ worth .

cy@@ cli@@ sts , jo@@ gg@@ ers and wal@@ kers took part yesterday in the 8@@ th cycling event on the gro@@ s@@ ser fel@@ d@@ berg mountain , giving their support to &apos; help for children with cancer &apos; .
the tour was a hard gr@@ ind for some , while others treated it as a light training session .
however , everyone agreed on one thing : it was a lot of fun .
thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski must have sle@@ pt well last night .
for the very first time in his life the head of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel bre@@ w@@ ery took his bike up the fel@@ d@@ berg .
and for a good cause .
he can put up with a little mus@@ cle sti@@ ff@@ ness , especially since his participation in the 8@@ th cycling event on the gro@@ s@@ ser fel@@ berg was in aid of the &apos; help for children with cancer &apos; association , and gave him a valuable personal insight .
a great thing .
&quot; i now know that i can do it - br@@ illi@@ ant ! &quot;
you didn &apos;t happen to have a little break to milk the applause ?
no , if i &apos;d stopped , i &apos;d never have been able to carry on ...
like thomas stu@@ dan@@ ski , a member for the c@@ du in the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel town council , many of the 7@@ 18 participants strugg@@ led in the early mountain de@@ w , coming close to exhaus@@ tion , but arriving happ@@ ily on top of the summit pla@@ te@@ au .
on the other hand , some others found it much easier to complete the full ele@@ ven kil@@ ome@@ tre route between ho@@ hem@@ ar@@ k and fel@@ d@@ berg .
nor@@ man di@@ ess@@ ner , for example .
the green politici@@ an , we@@ aring all red , from the municip@@ al council - red clothes , red bike - looked to be taking it g@@ ently ( &quot; qu@@ it some professionals here , so it &apos;s all about finishing ! &quot; ) - and then looked almost like a pro himself as he arrived at the end 45 minutes later without pa@@ using for bre@@ ath .
he was another one who did it all in one go , as did n@@ ina ku@@ hn , press spo@@ kes@@ person for the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel council , who did the route along side frank gr@@ ü@@ ne@@ is@@ en .
for both the tri@@ athle@@ tes the &quot; fel@@ d@@ berg cycling event &quot; was not necessarily a sporting challenge : &quot; this one is about char@@ ity , and that &apos;s why we &apos;re glad to be here - we &apos;d have gone out riding anyway today , &quot; ku@@ hn said .
along the route they met up with paul w@@ en@@ z@@ el from ob@@ er@@ re@@ i@@ f@@ en@@ berg .
the boy ( 12 ) had driven down to ob@@ er@@ us@@ el in the morning , only to immediately go back up again .
fl@@ ori@@ an zi@@ er@@ z from frankfurt got himself into the sadd@@ le at 9 am ; he &quot; did &quot; the fel@@ d@@ berg twice , before then whe@@ eling back home .
another one who enjoyed himself was &quot; fr@@ it@@ ten@@ -@@ ton@@ i &quot; .
for the manager of the ob@@ er@@ ur@@ sel cul@@ t ki@@ os@@ k , taking part in cycling events which go over the fel@@ d@@ berg is perfectly natural .
he took just 40 minutes to do the route with his 6.@@ 5-@@ kil@@ o racing bike .
a ma@@ d event .
for this cause i &apos;m very glad to be here , &quot; comm@@ ented andre@@ as bal@@ z@@ ke .
the well-@@ conditioned man from main@@ z said he was an &quot; ambitious racing cy@@ c@@ list . &quot;
and he must be , since he was riding a &quot; fi@@ xi@@ e-@@ bike &quot; which is a bike without ge@@ ars ...
but it was@@ n &apos;t only cy@@ cli@@ sts who ja@@ un@@ ted to the top - as was evi@@ d@@ enced not only by the 20 wal@@ kers , who clim@@ bed up via the white wall and the fu@@ ch@@ stan@@ z , but also by a jo@@ gger who pul@@ led behind him a ty@@ re with wei@@ ghts attached to him by a ro@@ pe .
mountain rescue doctor , professor vol@@ ker lis@@ ch@@ ke , who was there with his team to provide safety , and who was equipped with a four-@@ wheel bul@@ ly and qu@@ ad , said : &quot; i know him from frankfurt - he trains for a specialist sle@@ i@@ gh trail - it &apos;s just that he pul@@ ls the sle@@ i@@ gh himself . &quot; the man is , therefore , in a sense his own sle@@ i@@ gh dog .
the 7@@ 18 participants - which made them the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning .
the wal@@ kers started at 9.@@ 30 am .
then it was the turn of the cy@@ cli@@ sts and run@@ ners , who began at 10 am .
five minutes later the first mountain@@ -@@ bi@@ kers set off .
b@@ ent han@@ sen , chairman of the association &apos; cycling on the gro@@ s@@ ser fel@@ d@@ berg &apos; gave the starting orders and w@@ ished those taking part an enjoy@@ able trip .
next year , he hopes to have safety barriers on the course for the benefit of those taking part on the fel@@ d@@ berg .
