the report explicitly for the first time that the indian ocean , china , is a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china military threat theory , has given a greater recognition to the so - called chinese military threat .
peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report , " the same day it was officially submitted , us president bush also submitted a draft budget for fiscal 2007 .
if the army is added to the military operation in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states has fabr@@ icated the theory of other countries ' theory of aggression , reflecting the consistent style of the enemy in the pentagon , and its true purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to provide a vast us arms industrial group with more profits .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts ' discussions on the chinese national defense white paper , deng hong@@ zhou , said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national defense expenditures in the same period has generally shown a down@@ ward trend .
official statistics show that in 2004 , compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounts for more than 10 percent of the state 's fiscal expenditure for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only equivalent to 5.@@ 6 percent of the united states ' national defense spending , and its per capita military expenditure is only about one - sixth of the united states ' , with the per capita military expenditure of the military personnel being about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the land area of the united states is r@@ oughly the same as that of china 's territory , but the military expenditure is so huge . who exactly is the military force going beyond the legitimate defense needs ? this is an und@@ eni@@ able self - evident " operation " .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jian@@ q@@ un , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their military ri@@ vals in the future .
the 2004 national defense white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been able to catch up with the world in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent any military aircraft to other countries .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should strengthen cooperation through established channels , strengthen mutual understanding and friendship , and comprehensively promote the new century - oriented sino - us constructive and cooperative relations , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough in talks
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) the hamas cabinet seeking a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , april 8 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a victory in the legislative council election , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become a focus of international attention at present .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the next step of the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel have a stronger desire for the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations on the issue of the cabinet , on the issues of difficulties and sensitive points concerning future development .
premier 's post has fl@@ owed down , and no one has left .
hamas has won the power to form a cabinet , and some people worry that the prime minister of hamas may have a difference with ab@@ b@@ as , the current top leader .
moreover , visiting hamas president ab@@ d@@ el - ra@@ h@@ man al-@@ ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d stressed that the new palestinian government , which is formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concerns .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government with real power and threatened to suspend its economic aid and aid to palestine and to hand over the taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting the independent , thereby making the palestinians the center of trouble .
according to reports , in order to obtain the greatest international recognition , the united states has recently decided to support the independence party from both the egyptian and chinese sides , and the chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of gaza , jam@@ ali , ch@@ iss@@ an@@ al@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter how high the prime minister 's position is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to weak@@ en the strong color of hamas , and only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
power is being distributed in a timely manner .
from an internal point of view , the biggest challenge facing hamas 's cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian " y@@ in@@ ha@@ p " carried an analysis saying that hamas 's purpose of gathering people to achieve social welfare items is , however , to lack experience in governing and to have a good relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has a ruling experience .
hamas 's proposal on holding talks with fat@@ ah and establishing political partnership after the election has created a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given support to this day .
at present , whether fat@@ ah has any opinion in the cabinet is different , and a group of people advocate participation in the new government , thus doing something better than it , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas to do positive feelings with the legislative council , actively pursuing the opposition , as it wants .
the source pointed out that under the instig@@ ation of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also have a he@@ ated debate on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
another way is to establish a legislative committee framework , break away from the par@@ tis@@ an cabinet .
it is reported that hamas also designed a clean and uni@@ form government , but it has no choice but to make a specific list .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude and the technical expert - type government , it is also necessary to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will be elected on 16 june after the new term of the legislative council takes office . the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the premier and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
armed forces go further
the weapons in hamas are the weapons to be used to create a new government .
the us and israel have taken a very tough stance , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and refuse to participate in politics with arms .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ ass@@ ad stressed on 9 november that resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed problem actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the state of the armed forces ' management .
hamas 's political and economic reforms are a major component of the international community 's political system , and its political system is not linked with the q@@ ass@@ am armed forces .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions with the palestinian national authority .
at present , palestine has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel and an overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations with lo@@ ose subordinate armed factions , such as the branch davi@@ dian marty@@ rs brigade , the army of the red army of the pan dynasty , etc.
hamas , responsible for the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that operate their own business , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management rights .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations are under the control of the new government 's interior ministry .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is still no news .

china 's power production safety still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power regulatory commission ( s@@ dr@@ c ) said today that despite the fact that the country 's electric power production safety situation in 2005 remained stable , the country still faces severe challenges .
the vice - chairman of the state power regulatory commission , shi yu@@ bo , said at the fifth national meeting of the power safety production commission held here that in 2005 , china 's electric power production safety was generally stable and satisfactorily fulfilled the task of meeting the peak and summer in the year of electric power , thus ensuring the safe power supply , actively dealing with the attack of natural disasters , and basically ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system , safety of production equipment , and the large - scale reduction
however , he pointed out that with the change in power supply and demand and the large number of newly built power generating units that have been put into operation , the power industry will face new challenges .
these challenges include : the regional sea level of electricity shortage still has a long history of development , and the supply of electricity in some regions is still on the high side , and the demand for power is still on the low side , and the supply of electricity is still quite serious due to the ben@@ ign mechanism for electricity prices , and the problem of coal production is not effectively controlled .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and staff members and how to ensure normal production order will become a new issue facing us .
in view of the 2006 work of safe production of electric power , shi yu@@ bo said that it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of management of safe production of electric power , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of electric power safety , enhance the ability to deal with sudden incidents , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power plants and power networks , jointly safeguard the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job of supervising and managing the work of building the dam of power
it is reported that in light of the new situation in power safety management , the state power regulatory commission will review and revise the " provisional regulations on investigating the power production accident " that have already been promulgated this year . meanwhile , relevant regulations on the safety of the dam of the hydr@@ op@@ ower station and the safety of the second power system will be promulgated one after another this year .

the v@@ an@@ ity project will be re@@ produced after the start of the w@@ av@@ a project .
if the high gas mine does not carry out a policy of pul@@ ling out from the country first , then it must order it to stop production immediately .

we should make public the number of the 5,@@ 2@@ 43 already announced to the public , plus the number of 700 recently reported by various localities , one of the more than 700 coal mines , and the actual situation .
we should regard closing down as our regular work and keep closing those small towns and small towns that cause pollution to the environment without safety conditions .
the government of xi@@ ji@@ ao coal mine safety management should strengthen basic management .
it is necessary to immediately correct the phenomenon of not even allowing a small number of small coal mines to manage their land and to set up a standardized security management system .
in particular , we must grasp key state - owned coal mines , and absolutely cannot permit super - intense production by over@@ ri@@ ding workers .
this year 's production safety control indic@@ ator requires that the number of deaths in all kinds of accidents nationwide dropped by 3 percent from last year , of which coal mines dropped by 3.5 percent .

( winter olympics ) stimul@@ ant news analysis :
tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the united states has decided to send a children to iraq to take part in the war on terror , according to the report
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying@@ ying
although italy has repeatedly ordered that tur@@ in winter olympic games be held , the number of people who used stimul@@ ants was not as high as that of gy@@ m .
the tur@@ in winter olympics opened on the 16@@ th , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening of the olympic games . the police sent a group of children to the scene to investigate the use of banned drugs .
the i@@ oc announced the following day that the dispatch of the le@@ gen@@ d was out of the winter olympics . she was very happy at the winter season games this time . she was also a member of the world 's olympic committee , who won the silver med@@ al of the women 's 15 km individual match in the winter olympics .
the international winter winter season alliance held a two - day meeting on the same day to express its sympathy and solic@@ it@@ ude for the two - year ban on the distribution of children .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes are not allowed to use the stimul@@ ant d@@ os@@ es in the olympic games and will be depriv@@ ed of the quali@@ fication for the competition , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts . judicial organs are responsible for directly arre@@ sting and investigating the use of stimul@@ ants .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ ing , finally reached an agreement after the international olympic committee and the italian government reached agreement to open a new chapter in the olympic games using stimul@@ ant agents in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
through the unremitting efforts of the i@@ oc , italy has made considerable progress in its concession for the four days before the opening of the winter olympics , and has promised that the police will not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place . however , the drug - taking athletes who are positive will still be subject to investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
according to a report , the italian government supervis@@ es the chief executive of the tur@@ in winter olympics , pe@@ ter k@@ an@@ tor , who has sent the national her@@ bs incident to the du@@ ur@@ in procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ st@@ un@@ t have not yet confirmed the matter .
russia 's 2 nd winter team medical team , and@@ re@@ y mit@@ ov , revealed at noon on 17 july that the dispatch of a le@@ gen@@ d had already left tur@@ in and returned to the country .
he once worked in the world anti - stimul@@ ant organizations for many years , chinese sports official shi k@@ ang@@ cheng maintained that once the chinese her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary had returned to china , this incident would ultimately have been decided by the great p@@ ain that would be beyond re@@ memb@@ r@@ ance .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have played an important role in the anti - stimul@@ ant efforts of the winter olympic games and have not completely resolved the internet even though italy 's procuratorial organs have indeed interven@@ ed in this matter , it is also very difficult to say .
according to the previous statistics on the use of stimul@@ ant by italian athletes , the number of banned offenders has increased by a large margin .
therefore , senior italian correspon@@ dent pi@@ er@@ re of the italian lu@@ f@@ ka news agency said that the possibility of sending a children into prison is very small , and most of them are fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could try the abs@@ ence , the italian police did not go to other countries to ex@@ trad@@ ite the chinese play@@ er and serve the sentence .
if they are sent to l@@ v@@ a to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will also have no way to take her .
