( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time personnel and graduates from institutions of higher learning become main force for work hours
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau released the latest information on labor wages in 2006 , which is about 120 yuan in guiding wages , an increase of 11 percent over last year , and the original salaries are about 120 hours higher than last time .
according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , the number of hours of employees in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a report in china youth daily , college graduates and part - time personnel are major components of the work force for hours .
through direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the people are part - time personnel , and the proportion is 5@@ 1.1 percent .
the educational level of part - time workers is generally relatively high , mainly engaged in technical work such as transl@@ ation jobs , high proportion of part - time workers , and good health care personnel , reaching 6@@ 1.@@ 66 percent .
high income is an important reason why many people are engaged in the work of part - time jobs .
it is understood that the monthly income of a certain job may reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be difficult to find a job , just like the trans@@ lit@@ eration of the voice , and the monthly income of an hour 's working posts can be more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time celebr@@ ations of marri@@ ages in financial affairs .
and to broaden their knowledge of becoming interested in individuals , it is also a major reason for the favor@@ ed treatment of part - time workers .
for example , mr. gu , who is the manager of the human resources department of an enterprise , would have a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign - funded representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the biggest benefit of a part - time job was to keep on rene@@ wing his knowledge and to have the opportunity to involve another field . of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month also had some tem@@ pt@@ ation .
as the thre@@ sh@@ old for some hours of work is low , the form of work is flexible and free , and many graduates who are seeking employment are gradually f@@ ond of finding jobs , the number of hours of work is 14@@ 1 % of college and secondary school graduates in nearly three years .
i did n't want to work for an hour at the beginning , but after several months i felt it was a bit better than the n@@ ine@@ teen of the dprk .
after gradu@@ ating from university student huang , the job she found was not as satisfactory as before , and finally she hung up her name in a guesthouse . she played in the background of pi@@ an@@ o .
+ + + + + it is quite satisfied with the work now , for a hour of 100 yuan , and for the environment , what i want to do is to find a few hours of labor , + it is like a few hours of labor .
it is understood that an hour job has become the main source of work experience accumulated by some graduates seeking jobs , and their experience in work training and skills to improve communication skills in society .
the graduates work for an hour mainly concentr@@ ates on those who have a strong knowledge and technical skills , such as those who have a strong professional transl@@ ation position , highly modern performing arts positions , and their ratio to the total number of jobs in the transl@@ ation and the age of jobs is 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % .
some hours of work are not required to be high in some skills , such as food promotion agents , marketing agents , etc. , and unemployed personnel can simply undergo training .
the number of hours of employees was originally an unemployed person , which accounted for 3@@ 90 percent of the total number of unemployed people in the retail sector .

prc expert on us military threat in china , ' im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able '
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to provide assistance to the u.s. congress to help the chinese people understand the " four - year defense review report " which was submitted to congress a few days ago , which is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation against china 's normal national defense construction , playing on china 's military threat , and interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the way the united states should take to deal with china 's war of aggression or its war of china , which is directly involved in china or china 's directly wor@@ ding , to say that the war of aggression , as a major and emerging power , is most likely to have the potential to compete with the united states , and if china does not have any counter@@ measure , it will be very destruc@@
yao yun@@ zhu , a research fellow at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions , this was the first time in the strategic report on china 's national defense strategy , that china is the emerging power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
the + su@@ ite report clearly defin@@ es for the first time the development of china as a emerging strategic oppon@@ ent of russia , especially the so - called china military threat theory .
major general peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted a report on the 2007 fiscal year to congress . the budget for defense spending has reached $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if it plus the military action to be carried out in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break through the $ 500 - billion mark , creating a new historical high . peng qian said that the us national defense budget will almost be equivalent to that of all other countries in the world in military spending .
peng guang@@ qian believes that the us tr@@ ick of creating a threat to other countries reflects the consistent style of the enemy in china , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide the vast arms industrial group in the united states with more profits .
the experts said that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in several times in china 's national defense white papers , said that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditure has generally declined in the same period .
official statistics show that , compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over half of the state 's fiscal expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense expenditure in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - tenth of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - six@@ ty percent of that of the united states , and the per - capita military spending is about one - 30 of the us military 's .
the us area of its territory is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but its military expenditure is so huge , and who is in fact more than the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper on china 's national defense in 2004 said that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and impl@@ ements a defensive national defense policy .
china did not exist in the past or in the future , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
to date , china has not established any military bases in any other country , nor has it sent any single soldier to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 overseas military bases , and only one military base in asia .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas seeks new cabinet , says official
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas government has been trying to achieve a breakthrough in the cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , sept .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) , after winning the election of the legislative council , has drawn up a blueprint for the new government , which has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policy will hamas pursue will directly affect the peace process relevant parties ' policy orientation for the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are stepping up consultation to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points that involve future development in the cabinet .
who 's the prime minister 's office going to fall ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people outside the world worried that the supreme leader of hamas may have differences with ab@@ b@@ as .
the hamas leader , mar@@ shall , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was founded by hamas , would not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal also intensified international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their dis@@ appointment with a hamas government that holds real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent person is a policy that is correct .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as much as possible , hamas , a domestic and foreign leader who is gathering in egypt , decided a few days ago to choose the independent leader of the islamic university of jam@@ a@@ ica , m@@ ai@@ le wo@@ h@@ ad@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who will take office as prime minister , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should play down the hamas ' hard@@ line fla@@ v@@ or as much as possible , and only in this way can the success of the formation of the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to distribu@@ te power
within the party , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
an article carried by the palestine daily said that through social welfare projects , hamas has gathered people , but in the aspect of governance , it lacks experience and is not in a position to be compared with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the governing experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing relations with fat@@ ah 's political partners and jointly forming a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given any positive response to this .
fat@@ ah is currently divided into two groups , one group stands for participating in the new government , and the other faction ref@@ uses hamas to invite it , and the other is willing to make a positive effort in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ines to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative council to divor@@ ce itself from the party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technical expert - type government is no exception a form of cabinet for reducing external pressure .
according to the stipulations of the " basic law " of palestine , after the new legislative council took office on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the premier and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel have taken a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in politics with its guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the question of armed force actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected as the largest legislative party in the legislative council through democratic and free means , and has enabled its armed factions to do better in the sa@@ us@@ an brigade , which is similarly leg@@ alized by itself , to unify it into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions of armed forces into a palestinian national authority , which is supported by the people , but did not receive a wide - ranging response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization .
at present , palestine has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that are subordinate to the s@@ lo@@ com@@ d faction , like the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , the na@@ ha ph@@ ia eag@@ les of the aff@@ ili@@ ated fat@@ ah brigade .
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold discussions with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense departments will be managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no news has been announced .

according to the forecast of the american consumer electronics association , the sales of digital television sets in the united states will exceed that of traditional television sets for the first time this year , while the number of digital television sets is 8@@ 55 percent of high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new - type highly effective kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the east china sea university of japan has developed a biological kid@@ ney - making kid@@ ney which is similar to human kid@@ ney trans@@ missions . at the same time , it also has the function of re@@ taining material elements . it also has a small size , easy trans@@ plant , and very high level of research . it is expected that the research will bring benefits to patients with kid@@ ney diseases .
according to a recent report by the ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological kid@@ ne@@ ys are mainly composed of two parts , and part of them are trans@@ ported from blood to the human immun@@ e from the blood trans@@ fu@@ sion and the water - ne@@ tting process . in addition , the gen@@ e@@ tic ac@@ id is returned to the gen@@ e@@ tic sequ@@ ence of the person who returned to the blood of the trans@@ plan@@ ted blood .
the human body , the human body , the human body , the human body , the we@@ ine , the c@@ aves , the narrow pip@@ es of the human be@@ ings , and the inner tu@@ bes of the human be@@ ings are all covered with the we@@ ine pip@@ es that have the functions of de@@ grad@@ ating the waste .
this kind of sk@@ in cell can cause diseases caused by many blood trans@@ fu@@ sion , my@@ th@@ ological my@@ op@@ ia of my@@ th@@ m@@ ic my@@ ster@@ ies , which are de@@ formed as m@@ amm@@ ic ac@@ id and re@@ entry to blood , can also make the necessary grap@@ e of gl@@ uc@@ ose and c@@ and@@ y , as well as the blood of the mineral .
in the past , the gap between the use of water se@@ epage pressure to fil@@ ter waste from the human kid@@ ney cannot be completely removed , and the conditions for making the ther@@ ap@@ y and other components back to the blood .
researchers use the mountain she@@ ep to conduct biological human kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments , and the arti@@ ficial c@@ os@@ me@@ tic c@@ aves used pi@@ g cell@@ s in the c@@ w@@ l .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the human kid@@ ney had been able to function .

these challenges include : regional migr@@ ation of seas@@ onal period of power shortage will still exist , and the situation of supply and demand in some areas remains tight , and because the power - supply mechanism has not yet been formed , there still exist a fairly big problem in the supply of coal , and the problem of the decline in coal quality in electricity supply has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , the weak coal - supply structure , the out@@ dated
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed . how to maintain the stability of the contingent of workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .

south african envoy to china said that south africa does not exist in organized crime against chinese citizens .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african people 's republic of china ( south african ) will hold a reception here on the 13@@ th to mark the 50 th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between south africa and china , said hao jian@@ lin , commissioner of the south african embassy in china , in an exclusive interview with xinhua reporters .
he also said that the south african government will do everything possible to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
he said that the south african government hopes to reduce the rate of crime to zero and hopes that every person working in south africa will have a safe life and property .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a broad concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this issue and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention . overseas chinese compatriots have strengthened unity and friendship and cooper@@ ated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we express our most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of victims .
" we are very sor@@ ry for this , " said fu k@@ ang@@ ning , adding that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case in which a chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting down another suspect .
according to another report , the south african embassy in china disclosed that the criminal who was suspected of shooting a hong kong business@@ man in january this year had been arrested by south african police and the property of the victims had been recovered .
when talking about the possible impact of the killing of chinese citizens , fu@@ k@@ ang@@ ning believes that these incidents indeed pose a serious threat to trade between the two countries and to trade between them in tourism and other fields , but from a long - term point of view , the influence should not be great enough to influence the country in the long term .
according to the commissioner of tourism of the south african embassy , the embassy provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists to more than 2,000 people in south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27@@ 7 - billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent from the same period last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the series of incidents of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have caused a marked increase in the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to south african tourism bureau statistics , in the first half of 2005 , 20@@ ,@@ 3@@ 31 chinese tourists were travel@@ ing to south africa , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , about 200,000 chinese living in south africa are living in towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of fire@@ arms in south africa have not been de@@ ter@@ red by death , and therefore the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , cash and money with their family members will become the target of the criminal elements ' financial attack .

this year , w@@ as@@ co management will give priority to developing a se@@ ed sample .
if the gas well does not carry out se@@ aw@@ ing , then it will be done according to law to order it to stop production immediately .
shr@@ ink continues to fight a battle of breaking through the closed - door policy .
it is necessary to remove the 5@@ 2@@ 43 public notices that have been made public to the public , and the more than 700 coal mine p@@ its recently reported in various localities , which have been closed down .
it is necessary to regard closing down as regular work and constantly close down those projects that undermine the environment for pollution caused by natural resources and do not possess safety conditions .
pan@@ shi strength@@ ens basic management of coal mine safety .
we should immediately correct the tendency of cur@@ bing the small number of small mines that are in large state - owned mines and that have been in a chao@@ tic state - owned situation , and establish a standardized safety management system .
in particular , we should grasp key state - owned coal mines and absolutely not allow over@@ speeding capability to exceed the intensity of the personnel in production .
the targets for controlling safety in production this year demand that the number of deaths in various accidents nationwide be reduced by 3@@ 5.@@ 5 percent as compared with last year .
the excep@@ tionally serious accident that killed more than 10 people in one accident should have dropped by 5 percent , of which coal mines were down by 7@@ -@@ 7 percent .

( winter olympic games , stimul@@ ants ) news analysis : the dispatch of li@@ ov@@ a incident may not be settled without end .
tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ f@@ f attack is likely to end in a row
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly ordered that the host country be found to have used the stimul@@ ant during the winter olympics , all athletes may face the im@@ mort@@ al disaster of hel@@ l , but judging from various situations , such situations are not very likely to occur in this winter olympics for the first time .
tur@@ in winter olympic games explo@@ ded its first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since its opening on 16 february . or@@ le@@ a was found using banned sub@@ stances .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that the sending of le@@ if@@ a had been qu@@ it from the winter olympics . she received two med@@ als in the winter olympics , 15 kilometers per person , and was also depriv@@ ed .
the two - med@@ al international league made a decision on the same day to ban the distribution of the champ@@ ion league for two years .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes who have been found to have used stimul@@ ants in the olympic games will be dis@@ qualified and depriv@@ ed of the quali@@ fication for the competition , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ants by athletes is a criminal act and the judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who def@@ y the law with the example of three months to three years are still subject to im@@ pris@@ oned .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after going through a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to conduct negotiations on the basis of the italian law during this winter olympics to deal with the incident of athletes using stimul@@ ants .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' residence during the winter olympics , but the medic@@ inal p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des would still be subj@@ ected to investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympic games , p@@ es@@ can@@ t@@ te , has already sent the d@@ oping ag@@ ent to the du@@ ling@@ ling procuratorial organ .
however , the international olympic committee and p@@ es@@ can@@ t@@ ay himself have not confirmed this .
russia 's second winter med@@ al team medical , and@@ re@@ im@@ ov , revealed at noon on 17 february that p@@ ell@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to the country .
he has worked for many years in the world anti - d@@ oping agency , and he believes that once the hand@@ le@@ y@@ le returned to china , this matter may become im@@ meas@@ ur@@ able , and may not be able to stand by the feet of the feet .
shi said the i@@ oc and the italian government have been playing a key role in the anti - stimul@@ ant issue of winter olympic games , even if italy 's procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in the matter , the results are very difficult .
according to the previous practice of italy in imposing pen@@ alties on the use of stimul@@ ants by its athletes , the maximum penalty imposed on the banned is only two years imprisonment in the imprisonment phase of the year in italy .
therefore , italian ser@@ a senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re p@@ el@@ i said that the possibility of sending le@@ il@@ a into the prison is very small , even in the top , it is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could have a def@@ ect trial , the italian police could not even send le@@ if@@ a back to foreign countries to serve their sentence .
if al@@ ex@@ and@@ er ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will not have any way to take her .
