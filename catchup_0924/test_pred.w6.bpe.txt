experts said that since there is still no market for renminbi , insurance institutions have not yet used ris@@ ky means , and therefore the tim@@ ing for large - scale foreign exchange is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long term , the foreign investment should be increased at an annual rate of about one percent in the overall distribution of insurance companies .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb is under a large appreciation pressure , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
with regard to foreign exchange purchases and foreign exchange investments , we should take this matter cauti@@ ously .

chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the taiwan judicial personnel 's attempt to get involved in the election of leaders in the taiwan region .
taiwan 's prison administration has high administrative power .
according to a report in taiwan 's " ho pao , " chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the prosecu@@ tor or the investig@@ ator because of political factors or election considerations , and the involvement of the case may even affect the election campaign activities of the candidates of various parties , saying that he hopes this phenomenon will not exist in taiwan , but it may be very difficult .

gao jin@@ chi pointed out that the ga@@ o@@ xiong se@@ d@@ an , a judge of the ga@@ o@@ xiong higher court , had participated in a course at the k@@ ad@@ eng@@ e school several years ago , that is , because the relevant courses have the fla@@ v@@ or of a political party , they are a self - discipline committee formed by judges .

germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for its professional personnel
xinhua news agency , ber@@ lin , july 1 ( reporter wang huai@@ cheng )
german education and scientific research minister s@@ att@@ en recently said that germany should lower the " law on investment in foreign specialized personnel " and reduce the number of foreign experts to be recru@@ ited through the introduction of more foreign talents to solve the problem of the professional personnel needed in germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany is 15 to 64 years old , and the number of the work@@ force will drop year by year .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , the german labor force will be less than the current figure .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that germany 's current labor market has a large number of professional technical personnel , such as engine@@ ers , which are more professional .
according to statistics from the federal labor bureau , the german labor market under@@ went a total of about 1,@@ 300 tons of cop@@ per , which was 7@@ ,000 tons of steel , and the supply of some 9@@ ,@@ 600 technicians in may .
germany has made a lot of efforts to protect its own people 's employment , and to introduce foreign talent .
germany 's " su@@ pr@@ a law " stipulates that professionals from non - eu countries are not less than 8@@ 50,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot be granted a job or residence permit in germany .
sha@@ wan suggested that the quota be lowered to include euro .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously abide by the law ;
the " draft law on lawyers , " which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : " lawyers who have engaged in law research and other professional work , have higher ranks or higher levels of professional personnel , and apply for legal practice , after being approved by the judicial and administrative departments of the state council , can be appointed as legal coun@@ s@@ el .
( " chin@@ am@@ an , " on 28 june )
the law has a legal system that integr@@ ates theory with the traditional business , with the traditional teaching method , which mainly includes legal research and other activities such as cop@@ ying , but the latter is more engaged in the legal consultation process , legal consultation , and other specific activities .
for a long time , the law has , in addition to the existing stipulations on the use of foreign language , the phenomenon of the use of foreign language , the use of foreign language , the lack of necessary land , the lack of necessary authority in the field of real affairs , and the lack of necessary need for the development of the western region .
with regard to such differences in division of labor , what the law can do is to keep the sil@@ k , not to support any side .
however , the legal system of the procuratorial organs has a clear legal system , but it has obj@@ ectively recognized the legal system , which is higher than the legal domain in terms of legal affairs .
in fact , some enterprises engaged in the use of such purely theoretical research and teaching methods as the legal system , and their theoretical char@@ m is more closely related to the legal practice .
in this way , the bin@@ ding system of lawyers undoubtedly provides legal , legal , and conf@@ using qualifications for the legal field , an area that has an extremely bad influence , and a brand - new type of business has a bearing on the image of the household .
the super@@ sti@@ tion of the ar@@ c theoretical circles is more than these , such as the experts ' proof and feasibility studies , which may affect or even rej@@ ect court rul@@ ings , and also directly manif@@ est this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers terrorist attack
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 - - - ( reporter guo lin )
the british government has destroyed the range of the attacks from the highest level to the serious la@@ yer of the british , which indicates that the terrorist attacks in britain will not occur , but the attacks are extremely likely to be launched .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the scope of investigation to india and australia .
the eight arrested suspects were all arrested in the medical system , and the government would take necessary measures to ensure that the foreign immigrants who have entered the medical system work are treated in a state of emergency .
it is reported that there are nearly 10,000 medical staff working in the british public health system who have obtained medical qualifications overseas .
the prime minister also demanded that the outside world conduct investigations on the background of high - tech migr@@ ation , and the employers or relevant organizations will be required to provide background information .

the tourism industry is sl@@ ack@@ ening its efforts to make things clean , and to the greatest extent the conservation of nature and social civilization .
but when they go abroad , many people have encountered such a kind of worry , and they are su@@ ed by traders and intermedi@@ ary businesses .
both cars and tr@@ ains , the tr@@ uc@@ ks , will always be subject to the pressure of small traders and some un@@ authorized intermedi@@ ary .
it is not selling fl@@ oral pi@@ e , but selling off magazine , and it is also a matter of many un@@ specified intermedi@@ ary giving brief@@ ings about food , al@@ co@@ h@@ ol , or even false license .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , you will be j@@ en if you are not successful .
in some areas , there are also the same feelings in the style .
if we enter the gate , some people would like to use the se@@ ed and the little things that were related to the tourism .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more serious , and the y@@ a@@ xing will be mi@@ red and s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
some media have reported that many foreign tourists visiting xian have made a sp@@ in of the ancient sil@@ k of xian , but they do not have a clear idea of allowing more small businessmen to be du@@ st@@ y .
these include the hy@@ po@@ thes@@ is of the pur@@ i@@ fication of the br@@ ain , the sp@@ i@@ kes and the places that are needed to be built in an orderly manner , and to provide a qu@@ iet and harmonious environment for the purpose of keeping a clean heart .
the freedom of the traders is conf@@ using the mind of the business owners , and obj@@ ectively sabot@@ aging these kinds of public order , creating a brand - new pattern of pollution and environmental pollution . at the same time , it provides the cor@@ ner@@ stone and the opportunity .
what is important is that these are the wind@@ ows for the construction of local spiritual civilization , and the whole of the damage is not only the problem of image , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to make the tourism industry strong , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic tourist environment to gre@@ et the tourists coming from south to north , who will still want to come , who will dare to come ?
how did your tourism economy achieve economic results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , the number of tourists from the northern part of the country should be regarded as a matter of top priority .
i do n't know whether the market is a market , the small mer@@ ch@@ ant haw@@ ker 's operational behavior should be standardized , and the un@@ lic@@ enced business must be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can allow the gl@@ u@@ t to be happ@@ ily and happ@@ ily , and the hu@@ re@@ d@@ ling of the city to come again .
in a word , do n't let the traders get involved .
the red army has made active re@@ payment of insurance benefits .
the dong@@ cheng district in beijing has built - in products such as electric products , which are used as a minimum guarantee for the protection of 12 households .
( " xin jing bao " on 10 july )
this writ@@ er fe@@ els happy for the improvement of family life , but he volun@@ t@@ arily with@@ drew from the protection , and also made re@@ war@@ ding of the use of pol@@ y@@ len@@ e .
chi@@ feng street office deputy director said that in view of the problems of che@@ ating low - protection , encouraging active re@@ par@@ ations is the most important thing for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income insur@@ ers to free themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if this kind of thing is to call up the like to call up those who have been s@@ wind@@ ling for a long time , it is not possible to be some n@@ ai@@ ve .
in differ@@ enti@@ ating and clean@@ ing up in@@ sec@@ t protection , we should rely more on the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the protection of low - income households when enjoying the minimum allow@@ ance : if timely information on family members and changes in income , report on employment , accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ views , and other relevant departments should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the imper@@ ial se@@ epage of the imper@@ ial se@@ epage is a long - term measure .
the street has given the re@@ insurance authority a reward to the family whose sp@@ ell is bur@@ ied .
as a first - level government organization , the street 's expenditure is borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
the amount of the pen@@ ny must not be the same as that of the tax@@ pay@@ er ?
on the one hand , withdrawal from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have a certain degree of self - suffici@@ ency capability , and on the other hand , the applicants for low - income insurance do not still exist ?
the government finance department , which is called a life - saving money , should send emergency aid in s@@ now@@ y weather instead of adding more flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu di@@ an@@ yi is willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first person in charge of town affairs directly selected by the people from the county of q@@ il@@ ang , liu gu@@ i@@ yi , was elected for the fourth time after he took office , accepting democratic peti@@ tion for the fourth time , reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 6 percent .
at the press conference , liu con@@ g - yi described his position as " a good opportunity " for service providers .
( yesterday 's " new beijing post " )
liu li@@ an@@ yi 's services may be more than a few cadres in the system of appointment , and the personnel of the enterprises of the power of auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity , make people of the country even more true .
the number of candidates for the posts of candidates is the largest in terms of the system of appointments , and the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations , and the orientation of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be in the first place to be responsible to the people .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom are the key to determining the way the person elected will carry out his work .
some people doubt such democracy , like a fl@@ an@@ k like a democracy .
my view is that there is such a democratic form of corruption , which is even less than the form of a sp@@ in .
considering the reality of the history and current situation of the building of democracy at the grass - roots level in china , i think that the open election is a major breakthrough , democracy is an important component part of the development of democracy at the grass - roots level , and it is not imper@@ mis@@ sible to under@@ estimate the progress of democratic politics at the grass - roots level .

the us food and drug administration issued a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to be cautious in words , because scientists had found a new type of medicine in a new edition of " new ones " published on 21 may . this kind of be@@ ef - selling medicine would substantially increase the inci@@ d@@ ence of heart diseases and the pur@@ i@@ fication of patients .
the v@@ an@@ i@@ ya is therefore closely watched by the doctor and the patient .
statistics show that around 30 % of the households in the united states have been informed of the safety warnings in about a month .
in january and february this year , the pharm@@ acy and pois@@ ons board received only 50 cases and 73 adverse re@@ actions reports respectively .
these bad re@@ actions are less than water fo@@ am , and are more important than sudden heart attack .
however , the drug experts of the us drug administration believe that the results of the in@@ secure conclusion reached by the man di@@ eg@@ o are still early .
the board will hold a meeting on the en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion of d@@ an@@ i@@ el on july 30 .
in 1999 , the sp@@ i@@ el@@ ia was a pan@@ cre@@ as inj@@ ec@@ tor , which was used in ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic co@@ des .
around 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients have taken or are taking di@@ e@@ tary re@@ y@@ n@@ olds .
the british gre@@ en@@ ery , the gre@@ en@@ sp@@ an company , has always believed that cl@@ er@@ k is safe and that to patients , the more he is concerned about the safety of the patient is than the ir@@ r@@ it@@ ating .

a us defense department official said on 23 march that due to the changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is now re@@ considering the plan to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .

after two months of careful work , all the products that have violated regulations and exceeded the housing occup@@ ants have been moved out on schedule , and the inc@@ umb@@ ent cadres of the group have been assigned housing according to regulations .
the party committee of this unit has the courage to fight against the tough style , and it has also produced the effect of the pi@@ e . the original few cadres who were unwilling to actively distribu@@ te the organization have also expressed their willingness to submit to the decision of the organization .

the people 's armed forces platform of jing@@ jiang city has upgraded the quality of the armed forces cadres
the chinese military has built a brand - new frontier defense line in the coastal city of jing@@ jiang , jiangsu province , on 18 june . the armed police force of xi@@ ali@@ ai town , lu yu@@ qing , has given a lecture on " fighting and winning under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " and has received the attention of the students participating in the training .
this is a brand - new type of equipment that comb@@ ines the actual situation of the posts with the reality of the posts , and makes efforts to improve the overall quality of the officers .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered during the course of conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level that some cadres with special weapons were born in a well - known family , and had not yet worked in a position , and they did not concentrate their main energy on the armed work .
to this end , they have adopted such training methods as concentrated training , and relying on training in local party schools to regularly conduct training for special armed forces cadres , and worked hard to solve such problems as narrow - minded operations of cadres ' knowledge , lack of professional quality , and so on .
in connection with the central task , he boldly tr@@ acked the br@@ ains of the special - duty cadres , and improved his ability to work at a post .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organization departments , jointly formulated the " regulations on the appointment of post - posts by special armed forces cadres , " clearly stipul@@ ating that ministers must go to the party committee group and no longer hold other posts ;
and established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging military cadres with foreign countries , which is too old to adapt to the needs of armed forces at the grassroots level , and read@@ justed and exchanged cadres in a timely manner , and gave high priority to the work of promoting and using cadres who have a good overall quality .
not long ago , the director of the armed forces department of the new century , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing new under@@ water technology , filled the border of the domestic se@@ d@@ an , and upgraded the technology to the minister of the company .
the good will still need to be good
judging from the results of the match alone , 2 - 2 is reasonable . it is also like that that that can be accepted , and the key is the course of the competition , and how much regre@@ ts are there .
if iran leads the team by 2 to 0 , then the cou@@ p will be equ@@ alized to china , then it will definitely be different , and it will be very strong .
the good will cannot be good at the end , it can be said that it is an old problem .
the power of the sp@@ ur@@ s often does not know how to k@@ ick a ball under the situation , and the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a kind of thing that cannot be exposed to the side .
however , judging from the competition today , it seems that it is not as good as today .
sun ji@@ hai , sun ji@@ any@@ in , zheng zhi@@ qin , and other people k@@ ic@@ ked the ball in europe without saying that li wei and others were also long@@ jing s@@ and s@@ and s@@ and s@@ and s@@ ail@@ ors . they saw many things , and said that they were not familiar with the psychological quality .
this regre@@ t@@ fully su@@ ed the iranian team , probably because it was a temporary deployment of troops and sever@@ s .
the iranian team was replaced by two men in a backward condition , and the scene was immediately covered .
the sp@@ a half range also has three functions , and the effect is not good .
we should overcome the problem that good relations cannot be good and good , and we must find the right root of problems .
if the problem is accurately identified and the problem is changed , it is probably not difficult to find .
fe@@ aring that he would be afraid of being in a hur@@ ry to get medical treatment .
if this goes on , it will be like a k@@ ic@@ king , even more race , old problems will still be committed , and it will not be possible to talk about the k@@ ic@@ king that everybody is looking forward to .
