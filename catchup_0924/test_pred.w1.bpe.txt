the pla 's first large - scale exercise of the " blue army " was held in the great hall of the people on 1 july in ber@@ lin .
the german education and scientific research minister , sha man - su@@ p , said the other day that germany should lower the " fei fei law " requirement on importing foreign professional personnel . this will help increase the number of foreign talents and increase the number of foreign personnel .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany will increase its output value by 15 to 64 years .
if there is no sufficient immigration , the population will increase to 20@@ 20 , and germany 's labor force will decrease by 6 percent as compared with the present .
however , german employers ' federation and german engine@@ er association have reported that the number of german employees in germany is now on the rise , and engine@@ ers work personnel from the engine@@ ers work in the labor market are much larger than that of professional engine@@ ers .
according to the statistics of the german federal labor bureau , the number of german workers in the labor market in may this year increased by about 1.@@ 27@@ 8 million , and the output of the german engine@@ ers is about 9@@ 60 million .
the fact that germany has been working for the country to protect its own human rights and to introduce foreign talents is a higher thre@@ sh@@ old .
the german " tro@@ jan law " stipulates that no one in the eu speci@@ al@@ izes in personnel who do not make up less than 8@@ 5@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot get the right to work and residence in germany .
the chinese side has proposed that this quota be lowered to the standard of the euro .
do n't have laws , theories , and theory circles , as well as scholars , worry about laws , they are very much in their theories .
recently , the npc standing committee submitted a " report on the law of lawyers , " which was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , to discuss the draft amendments . the draft law has a high level or similar professional background .

the law has something to do with the theory of taiwan , and the industry is worried about the shortage of taiwan scholars . the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , such as the routine work of the npc deputies , and the latter is mostly engaged in legal consultations and consultations , such as legal services , and specifically conduct .
for a long time , legal experts have predicted that taiwan 's laws are too much and do not meet the standards of chinese people .
as for this kind of division of labor , the law can be done by the maintenance of the status of the industry rather than the industry , support any one party .
however , the " law of lawyers " has lowered the standards of the industry and introduced the industry in objective terms .
in fact , some people who are engaged in the international law purely origin@@ ated in theories and teaching materials .
this way , the poor 's - standard lawyers are no doubt the legal standard .

british cu@@ ts terrorist attacks
the pla 's first large - scale exercise of " blue army " was held in the great hall of the people on 5 july .
british government officials said that the terrorist attack has increased from the top level to the top level .
at present , the british police will investigate the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
since the arrested persons are still being detained , the police have not found any evidence of the terrorist attacks .
it is learned that nearly ai@@ ded some public hospitals in britain , some of them have started to pay hom@@ age to the doctor overseas .
the prime minister also called for a thorough review of the current situation of high - tech migr@@ ants , and the employers or relevant agencies will ask for a background information .
the chinese government has always been concerned about the issue .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the importance of tourism .
but in the country , the number of people who travel in the country has been hit by such a kind of mis@@ understanding , and the fact that the business deal@@ ers and intermedi@@ aries are sur@@ ging the industry .
no matter whether it is automob@@ iles or tr@@ ains , the top - level cars always suffer from small - sized commercial sales and some un@@ certified intermedi@@ aries .
however , it is not selling something to taiwan ;
you will not accept the , he can ch@@ ase the car for several hundred meters , and there is a big gap between them .
in some scen@@ ic spots , many schools are also very popular .
the number of people who have not entered the gate is increasing , and some people worry about taiwan 's economy .
we should not let go after entering the door .
zeng has been reported by the media .
these include stations , stations , and these places , such as beijing , beijing , beijing , and beijing .
the v@@ end@@ or of the trad@@ er , the ca@@ ke , and the ca@@ ke , did not say obj@@ ectively that they had destroyed these public facilities .
the important thing is that these kinds of local prot@@ ecti@@ onism and ignor@@ ance are the window for the construction of spiritual civilization in our country . the damage is not only an image issue , but also a major impact on the development of the local economy .
let us imag@@ ine , if you want to do a big and strong tourist industry , but you use this method of dis@@ order to make a good deal of preparations for the southern - northern trip , who will still be willing to come , and who will dare to come ?
you are a tourist economy .
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , the number of tourists from the north and the south will be creating a civilized tourist environment . it should be said that the pressing task at present is to create a civilized tourist environment .
the chinese government is not a market , but a pe@@ d@@ ler 's business activities should be standardized , and no license should be given to the operation . illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
the development of a civilized and orderly environment will provide a rare opportunity for the taiwan compatriots to make happy trips to taiwan . they will also be happy to see that this situation has changed .
a sentence : the chinese people are not afraid of losing their lives .
the chinese government will take the initiative to reward and reward those who have not become qualified to make their contributions .
beijing 's dong@@ cheng district has listed the distribution of electricity and the prices of electrical products as a measure to protect 12 households .
( " new beijing , " " on 10 july )
this writ@@ er has provided a valuable opportunity for the improvement of the living standards of these families , but it has never mentioned the proposi@@ tion of paying attention to those households who have contributed to the improvement of their living standards .
the construction of the streets was a very important one , and some people worry about the problems such as dec@@ ep@@ tive and poor maintenance .
this example has been proved by the fact that it is encouraging other low - income insurance personnel to break away from difficulties through their own efforts . if they are trying to turn around their strength , they will need to help them solve problems in the long term .
in terms of the division and the clean@@ up of low - income households , it is more necessary to rely on legal means .
the departments concerned should strengthen the work of ensuring the basic livelihood of the low - income households and should provide them with timely information on the number of family members and the changes in income , report on the employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination . the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the phenomenon of paying attention to the need to pay back the money is a long - term measure .
the neighbor@@ hood has also set up a number of temporary incen@@ tive mechanisms to encourage and reward families with such achievements .
the street is a primary - level government organization , its expenditure is determined by the financial appropri@@ ation .
the city 's tax revenue is also about $ 3@@ 00,000 .
on the one hand , it is necessary to withdraw from the low - income families to prove that they have certain capability to pay themselves to their own production and thus apply for low - income personnel .
the " s@@ avi@@ or " , known as the fund for lif@@ es@@ aving money , should be provided in snow - covered areas instead of jin@@ hua .

in the meeting with liu con@@ g - yi , the reporter said : " we have made our position known to the chinese side as a service provid@@ er .
( yesterday 's " new beijing daily " )
liu said that china has become a country of the world 's largest population , and that china has become increasingly dependent on foreign countries .
the public promotion of the " three - step " election system is the most eye - cat@@ ching one , that the former is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses of the people , and the latter mainly consists of the organization of higher - level organizations , and the orientation of the source of power . the former determin@@ es that the former must be responsible to the public .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom are the key to determining the election candidate 's work .
some people questi@@ oned such words as " democracy and human rights are more important than the same ru@@ ins of democracy .
i mean that the united states has such a view .
considering the fact that china 's grass - roots democratic political construction and the current situation , i think the public promotion campaign has already become a major political issue .

the 72 - year - old p@@ av@@ ol is a native of ram@@ ad@@ i .
she said that the law society of china , the taiwan affairs department , and the pla , had been involved in the drafting of the law .
she also worked to promote social welfare , and was one of many cultural undertakings and social welfare organizations .
analysts believe that the us - china relations have become a candidate because some americans worry about china 's future .
in india , g@@ and@@ hi family has been controlling the ruling coalition for a long time .
p@@ aul mor@@ al@@ es was also welcomed by a large number of female voters , and the female voters believed that the par@@ agu@@ ay would be somewhat more ignor@@ ant in the fact that women are still pre@@ occupied with a serious sense of discrimination against female .
the constitution stipulates that india is a member of the federation system , and the president is the nom@@ ine@@ e of the state and the head of state of india , and does not represent any party organization , and more is a symb@@ ol .
