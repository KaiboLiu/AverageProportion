the l@@ uck , if added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , will be added to the budget for the fiscal year 2007 .
peng guang@@ qian said : the cor@@ ro@@ sion of the theory of the threat of other countries reflects the fact that the pentagon has consistently acted in its style , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and create a more favorable environment for the us arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
he has participated in the drafting of china 's national defense white paper many times . deng hong@@ zhou , a military expert , said : since the 1990 s , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has declined .
official data show that the total foreign trade volume between china and 1979 accounted for 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent of the national fiscal expenditure for the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was $ 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion , an increase of only about half of the us 's military spending . the us military spending per capita is only equivalent to about one - third of the us 's military spending , and the military 's per capita military spending is about one - thir@@ ty of the us military 's total .
j@@ ack@@ son , the united states ' land area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , but the difference in military spending is so huge , and who exactly is the military force going beyond the legitimate defense needs . this is self - evident .
" the chinese government has always attached great importance to the development of the relations with the united states and has made efforts to promote the development of the relations between the two countries , " he said .
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily in the future .
the 2004 china 's national defense white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been engaged in any talks in the past or will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other countries , nor has it provided military bases to other countries .
professor huang ji@@ as@@ hu of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and cooperation through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the development of constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

china : hamas to form cabinet to seek new breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has been trying to break through the political deadlock in the cabinet formation of its cabinet .
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao , huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative committee , how to draw a new government blueprint has become a major issue of concern in the international community at present .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue directly aff@@ ects the peace process 's future direction of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up their consultations and are holding consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet that involves difficulties and sensitive points in the development of the future situation .
the chinese premier 's position is a great challenge to the world .
hamas won the cabinet 's approval , and some people outside worried that mu@@ barak 's government might be connected with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the us delegation to the middle east peace process , which is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel have explicitly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government with actual power and threatened to break off economic aid and provide economic aid to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible tactics .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as far as possible , the hamas , which has gathered in egypt , recently decided to choose independent persons from the shar@@ j@@ ah islamic school board chairman j@@ al@@ em@@ a j@@ al@@ al@@ al@@ em@@ i to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the parties concerned .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how much the premier 's position will be and which one 's family , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down hamas 's tough color , and only thus can he guarantee the success of the formation of a cabinet .
the power is distributed in a certain sense , and the people 's thinking is being examined and discussed .
in terms of internal affairs , the most difficult issue facing the hamas cabinet is the lack of adequate governing experience .
the palestinian newspaper " al-@@ ha@@ '@@ ar " carried an analysis , saying that hamas has gathered people through social welfare projects , but it has not been able to experience in governing and has nothing to do with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the ruling experience .
hamas proposed a new constitution after the election to establish diplomatic partners .
the fat@@ ah 's internal situation is still not clear about whether to join the cabinet . a faction advocating participation in the new government has thus done something , while the other faction ref@@ uses hamas 's invitation and is willing to make a g@@ il@@ t ruling in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that after ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , the fat@@ ah leader gradually le@@ an@@ ed toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah have also been engaged in a fierce struggle on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to establish a legislative committee outside the framework of the legislative yuan , divor@@ cing itself from the party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean expert model .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government has not lost its efforts to form a cabinet that can reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the new government will hold a meeting of the palestinian legislative council after the new legislative committee takes office on 16 february .
the armed forces are heading for a new stage of development
the weapons in hamas are the most important weapons to be used to establish a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect their armed participation in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 november that armed resistance was a result of the choice of strategy of the organization .
the armed conflict in fact includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas has been trying to win the election of the first - largest legislative party through democratic and free means , thus making it impossible for its subordinate armed factions to rise leg@@ id@@ ary of q@@ ass@@ am brigade .
hamas once proposed that all factions be unified into a palestinian national authority , and the people 's army should be moved , but it has not received a wide response , and it has been attacked by the islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ad ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some organizational relations that are sl@@ ack in its organizational relations , such as tig@@ er , al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brigade , court tig@@ er , rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ishing , and so on .
the hamas , which is in charge of forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of all sides in their own hands and distribu@@ te the authority for security management in a rational manner .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense organs , and other organizations , but is under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue and no progress has been made so far .

after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar expedi@@ tion has been playing an increasingly important role in the world 's polar exploration .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the power supply and demand situation and the successive emergence of a large number of new generating units , the safety of power production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional migr@@ ation time s@@ car@@ city and lack of electricity demand .
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will be exposed one after another . how to maintain the stability of the contingent of workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing them .
in view of the fact that power production safety work in 2006 was being carried out , shi yu@@ bo said : we should further sol@@ i@@ dif@@ y the basic work in power safety production management , speed up the establishment and improvement of an emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance our ability to deal with sudden incidents , and strengthen coordination and cooperation with power plants and power networks to jointly safeguard the safety of the power system . we should continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the safety of the dam

south african envoy to china says no death of rac@@ ial mu@@ ster directed at chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a consulate general in beijing to help the chinese people in their fight against sars , said fu ti@@ es@@ han , charge d ' aff@@ ai@@ res of south africa , on tuesday
he also said that the south african government will do its utmost to crack down on all forms of crime .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said that the south african government hopes to lower the crime rate to zero and make efforts to stop all criminals who work in south africa .
since 2006 , more than four chinese students have been killed in south africa , including four chinese living in the south african country .
the chinese foreign ministry has lod@@ ged representations with the south african side and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , strengthen unity and friendship among overseas chinese , and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
l@@ uc@@ ky , we express the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we feel regret about this .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of the chinese woman chen jian@@ qing , who was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the south african embassy in china was suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year . the victims ' property has been recovered .
speaking about the killing of chinese citizens , jiang zemin said : the chinese government has always attached great importance to these incidents .
the south african embassy tourism commissioner , mr n@@ el@@ son n@@ el@@ son , said that the embassy only provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa has invested more than $ 2 billion in africa by 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached 7.@@ 27 billion us dollars , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the continuous outbreak of chinese citizens ' death tol@@ l in 2004 has had a serious impact on the number of chinese tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .
the total number of tourists in the country is expected to reach 3@@ 00,000 in the first half of 2005 , up by 14.@@ 5 percent over the same period of last year , according to the south african tourism administration .
the chinese people living in south africa now have around 200,000 , and are spread to cities and towns in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor in south africa 's society is large , the unemployment rate is high , and the flood of guns is high , there is no deterr@@ ent against death penalty , so the crime rate is still high .
