germany to reduce the introduction of professional personnel
the reporter learned from the xinhua news agency , ber@@ lin , 1 july ( reporter wang huai@@ cheng ) .
german minister of education and scientific research sha man - su@@ en said recently that germany should lower the " law " to provide preferential policies for the introduction of foreign professional personnel and to increase the number of foreign personnel to solve the problems facing germany in professional personnel , which is currently facing germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , the population of the country , which is between 15 and 64 , will decrease year by year .
if there is no enough immigrants , and by 20@@ :@@ 00 , german labor will be reduced by 6 percent .
however , the german federation of employers and the german engine@@ ers association reported that in germany 's current labor market , engine@@ ers ' professional technicians are relatively large .
according to statistics from the federal labor bureau , in may this year , the number of engine@@ ers in germany 's labor market was approximately 17@@ ,@@ 700 , with technicians suppl@@ ying about 6@@ 00,000 tons of rice .
to protect their own employment , germany has set up a relatively high level of thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of foreign talent .
" the law " stipulates that non - eu countries ' professionals are not allowed to live in germany under the protection of 8.@@ 55 million eur@@ os , or else they cannot receive the permission to work and live in germany .
sha@@ h@@ wan suggested that this quota be lowered to the minimum .
we should not only cherish super@@ sti@@ tion and law but also pursue theory .
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which has been submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently , stipulates : units and individuals who have engaged in legal research and other specialized work have special skills , such as high - ranking personnel or other professional personnel , who apply for law enforcement , have been examined and approved by the judicial and administrative departments of the state council , and may be allowed to practi@@ se as lawyers .
( 28 june , china ) " no . 1 " )
there are great theories and great masters of china and great practice in the legal field , the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and the small and medium - sized enterprises under the latter are mostly engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , consultation , legal services , and other specific activities such as the latter .
for a long time , the theory and the practice of the chinese people have been very eye - cat@@ ching in the country , and the theory of the great family of the chinese people , the theory of the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] is a theory of the mechan@@ ized army , the actual situation of the armed forces , and the great contributions made by the theore@@ tic circles to the theory of the chinese revolution and the practice of the great mechan@@ ized warfare .
with regard to such differences in division of labor , what the law can do is to maintain , not to support , any kind of country .
however , the rein@@ s of lawyers in the " law of lawyers " have been obj@@ ectively recognized by the law and the great unity of the legal circles , which is higher than those of the law .
in fact , some foreign enterprises engaged in legal system , such as the international law of the legal system , and experts and scholars in teaching , and their theory has been very deep and also very much in line with the actual work of the law .
thus , the lawyers ' system is undoubtedly a kind of law , but it is not a simple condition that the people of china are able to live in a good m@@ ood .
the great blind faith in theory is not only not only these , but also the experts and experts will regularly influence and even ve@@ to court judg@@ ments .
china - funded ships are encouraged to fly high .

to further promote the healthy development of china 's maritime transportation industry and strengthen the country 's ship , the ministry of maritime affairs issued a circular on the special topic of china 's participation in international shipping business , which was triggered by the registration and hang@@ ing of foreign flag . the ministry of communications recently issued a " circular on the special registration policy for chinese - invested international shipping vessels " , which explicitly states that the conditions for the special treatment policy and application procedures for the special case are stipulated , and that the
the application shall be made by the dalian ship in shanghai .

the british government launched a terrorist attack from the highest level to the lowest level in the country , and this indicated that the british terrorist attack would not occur soon , but the attack would still be extremely likely .
at present , the british police are shif@@ ting the investigation scope to india and australia .

after the mer@@ ch@@ ants are allowed to do something
the xi@@ '@@ an tourism project is a brilliant fe@@ at of the chinese people , and it is a natural phenomenon that enjoys the greatest degree of civilization in society .
but in china , many people are suffering such a kind of an@@ no@@ ying , and they are being attacked by traders and doing intermedi@@ ary business .
both cars and tr@@ ains , and vehicles , and vehicles always suffer small businesses .
it is not a sal@@ v@@ age , a bur@@ n p@@ ick@@ le , a newspaper , or a journal , and many other unlicensed intermedi@@ ary agencies , such as the intermedi@@ ary , even the permit , etc.
if you do n't accept it , he can follow you several hundred meters , it 's very difficult to become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some places , many of them have the same feelings .
without the entrance , there are people like the tourism industry and the little bu@@ m@@ ps .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more . no matter how good it is , y@@ a@@ xing is also mi@@ red in a few words .
according to a media report , many foreign tourists in xian have a great impact on the xi ' an mon@@ ument , but they have also expressed their admir@@ ation for the small mer@@ ch@@ ants who have received more than the re@@ ac@@ tors ' clam@@ or .
the station , the wind , the soul of the station , is the country 's most important and most unique place , and should be civilized and harmonious .
the freedom of v@@ end@@ ors , the chao@@ tic mentality of the v@@ end@@ ors , the objective damage to these homes of the public , and the formation of a protective umb@@ rel@@ la and environmental pollution . at the same time , it also provided conditions for the operators and opportunities .
what is important is that these are the wind@@ ows for the construction of spiritual civilization in hong kong , and the entire ba@@ g of the country , damaged not only the image issue , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to become a big and powerful tourist industry , you will use such a chao@@ tic and beautiful tourist environment to welcome the arrival of guests from south to north , who will come ?
your tourism economy has achieved any results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourist season , the city has created a new civilization for tourists from all over the country . it should be said that the task of the moment is to be called a task of top priority .
it is not a market , a small business haw@@ ker 's business behavior should be standardized , and the business of a un@@ certified business should be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can allow the young people to feel happy and to live in peace and love the country .
in one sentence , let traders not let go .
the government will take the initiative to re@@ pay and reward the military 's excellent achievements .
the construction of the dong@@ cheng district in beijing has issued electric products and other products , as a measure to provide low - income protection for 12 households on their own initiative .
( xin@@ jing bao ) 10 july
i am pleased to see the improvement of these family life , but i have taken the initiative to re@@ treat , and the plus the re@@ wards , the practice of re@@ war@@ ding families , is in a complex m@@ ood .
ji@@ xi district office deputy director said that the village dec@@ ap@@ it@@ ated its residents and encouraged them to return home volun@@ t@@ arily because of the low - income insurance problem .
if this model is to encourage other low - income insur@@ ers to get rid of their difficulties through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating , and if they want to use this to call it , those who have long been s@@ wind@@ ling to maintain their low - income status , then they are not sp@@ ared .
in the course of differ@@ enti@@ ating and sor@@ ting out in@@ sured households , we should rely more on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of the minimum sub@@ sist@@ ence allow@@ ance households , such as promptly noti@@ fying family members and changes in income , reporting on employment , accepting peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , and other relevant departments should step up supervision and inspection .
after all , the policies of re@@ treating according to law will not last long .
the street has not yet received the re@@ wards of the family , and who is bur@@ ied the bill ?
as a primary government organization , neighbor@@ hood committees are ear@@ marked for their expenditure .
the tax@@ pay@@ ers ' money should not be spent on the same day .
on the one hand , the withdrawal of families with low income has proved that they have possess@@ ed certain national capability , and their own capability , while on the other hand , the number of people applying for low protection still exists ?
the us government 's financial appropri@@ ation , which is called a life - saving money , should provide fuel in the snow rather than adding fuel to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu gang@@ yi is willing to be a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first person in the country who directly ch@@ ose the new town , the m@@ ai@@ lan town of the new capital city , liu yi , accepted the fourth democratic test after taking office , and the rate of satisfaction of the people who had taken office was 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
when the reporter had a dialogue with liu guang@@ yi , liu gang yi defined himself as a veteran of service .
( yesterday 's beijing news )
liu ying@@ yi 's service , the v@@ agr@@ ant , may be more effective than some cadres who appoint the cadres , and the people who work in the real world are even more genuine .
the appointment system is more than one big , the largest in terms of the system of ordinary party members , and the people are determined to source their power , while the latter is mainly appointed by the higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must be placed in the first place in charge of the people .
the source of power and the person responsible are the major factors determining how the elected person will carry out his work .
some people questi@@ oned how the democracy of such a kind of democracy was like a game of democracy .
my view is that with such democracy , the traditional culture of democracy is more like that .
considering that the building of china 's grassroots democratic politics is a matter of course and the current situation , i think that the public election is a major breakthrough , and democracy is a great banner and a great power for promoting democracy at the grass - roots level .

after suffering a large number of female voters , p@@ ai@@ chi voters believe that par@@ ade will be opened up to discrimination women 's concepts in india , a female country with a serious women concept , and in turn raise women 's status .

the people 's armed forces of jing@@ jiang city have upgraded the quality of specialized armed forces cadres

this is a scene of the mobilization of manpower and armed forces cadres in line with their actual status , making efforts to improve the overall quality of specialized armed forces cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department found during an investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some cadres in the armed forces worked in their posts , and were also in their posts , but did not concentrate their main energy on doing armed work .
for this purpose , they adopted the method of concentrated training and support training for local party schools , and regularly conduct special training for specialized armed force cadres , with a view to resolving the problem of heavy burden on the rear of military cadres and their quality of service .
in light of the central task , they boldly assigned tasks to cadres , adopted the practice of training in posts , and improved their ability to work .
at the same time , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " regulations on appointing special armed forces cadres by bidding for posts , " explicitly stipul@@ ating that armed forces ministers must enter the party committee and no longer hold other positions in their positions .
a system for readjusting and exchanging specialized military cadres has been established , and some old cadres who do not meet the needs of grassroots armed forces have been promptly adjusted and exchanged , and they have played a positive role in helping comrades who have good comprehensive quality and good job skills .
not long ago , the director of the armed forces department of the new century , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a technical detachment in innov@@ ating and developing the under@@ water vessel technology , thus filling in the domestic arena the armed forces department of the company .
at the beginning , good will have to be properly handled .
just from the results of the competition , the two - point score is reasonable , and also the traditional way of thinking can be accepted . the key is the competition process , how many regre@@ ts .
if iran is to lead the other two by 2 : 0 , then the score will be equal , then the feeling of china will definitely be different , and it will be very long , very strong , and the situation is like the situation .
good will cannot end up well , and it can be said that it is old .
the phenomenon of the current situation is often not being k@@ no@@ c@@ ked on , and the views of ordinary people are the psychological quality of china 's people .
this is indeed not like a king of good intentions in the end .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that the competition is not perfect .
sun ji@@ hai , sun jia@@ xiang , ji@@ angu@@ o , zheng zhi@@ zhi , and others k@@ ic@@ ked the ball in europe , but li wei feng and others were also a veteran veteran of the ancient s@@ and . they saw many things like that , looking at it , they said that they would not have any problem of psychological quality .
it is regre@@ tt@@ able that the iranian team has been forced to put down this time because it is afraid that it will deploy troops .
the iranian team , under backward conditions , changed the two and the scene immediately got the shad@@ ow .
the half of the ball@@ s also changed the effect of the three king@@ dom@@ s .
overcome the old hab@@ it of being good at beginning and not being good at end , and must accurately find out the root cause of the problem .
as long as the problems are accurately identified and the methods of correc@@ ting the mistakes are probably not difficult to find .
they are afraid of being anx@@ ious for medical treatment .
if this is the case , then the games will be held again , and the old mistakes will be made . it will not be possible to talk about k@@ ic@@ king a competition that everyone is exp@@ ecting .
