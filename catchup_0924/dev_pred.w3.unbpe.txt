china to hold talks with hamas on new round of six - party talks
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) the hamas government has found itself seeking to form a cabinet to break the deadlock
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the legislative council election , and how to draw up a new plan for the new government has become a major topic of international concern at present .
hamas will pursue a new policy of directly affecting peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel 's boycott attitude has added variables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves difficulties and sensitive points in future development .
the " three links " are the most difficult and the most difficult task is to make the premier 's office fall .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people are worried that hamas 's prime minister might be connected with the current supreme leader abbas .
moreover , the us secretary of state , mahmoud abbas , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which is under the leadership of hamas , will not recognize israel . this tough signal has also aggravated the international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government that holds real power and will threaten to halt economic aid to palestine and send tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruct hamas from making a flexible strategy adjustment , and the selection of an independent is a compromise .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition as much as possible , the hamas and chinese leaders in egypt recently decided to elect an independent leader , shaath , a board chairman of the board of directors of the islamic grand school of islamic university , to take up the post of new prime minister .
this move has not yet been supported by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hussein , said that no matter how high the prime minister 's office is , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to dilute hamas 's hard - line color as much as possible . only by so doing will it be possible to ensure the success of the cabinet formation .
the " three represents " are the basic questions of how to allocate power
domestically , the hamas cabinet is facing the most serious challenge .
on the eve of the " day of peace " of palestine , an article carried by the paper says that hamas has concentrated its people on social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has experience in ruling .
hamas has proposed a peace agreement with fatah after the election , saying that it is a common aspiration of a political coalition government , but fatah has not given any positive support to it .
fatah is currently engaged in a debate on whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction is advocating participation in the new government , thus getting some things done , while the other party refuses to accept hamas 's invitation , and is willing to make a positive opposition party committee .
the source pointed out : in the face of abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually leaned toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah have also been working together on the issue of the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to form a legislative committee framework that is outside the framework of a political party .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean - up expert type of government . however , the specific name list was unclear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical specialist government is no longer a kind of organization to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will be sworn in on 16 november after the election of the prime minister and forming a cabinet .
the " three stresses " education is a major political issue .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are the most important weapons to be faced by the new government .
the united states and israel are very tough in their attitude and resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and reject its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader mahmoud al-asad stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice chosen by this organization .
armed problems actually include the legality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces .
hamas has been trying to achieve its goal of " a new government " by winning the international recognition of its first major party in the legislature through democracy and freedom .
hamas once proposed to separate armed groups from palestine to fight for the authority of the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive wide response . it also met with opposition from the palestinian islamic jihad organization ( jahamid ) .
palestine now has 60,000 security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah also had some organizational relations .
the chief hamas , who is in charge of forming the cabinet , must hold talks with abbas on how to manage the armed forces of all kinds of self - government and rationally allocate their security management powers .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations in the new government , and then go to the interior ministry .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further written statement has been made .

in 1997 , china became the first member of the arctic science committee and won the respect and support of the international polar affairs .

the insulation is now being made to establish the third antarctic expedition station , and is also china 's first south arctic inland observation station .
sun zhihui said :
the cave - ins have been working for more than 20 years . china 's polar expedition undertaking has played an important role in the world 's polar observation . however , compared with other major polar expeditions , china still has a large gap , and we must try our best to catch up with others .
he said .
sun zhifeng revealed that china will publish a book entitled " china 's polar exploration . "

we 'll just talk about the victims ' families .

because many chinese do not understand english , they have a common cash at home , and they are more apt to become the targets of criminal elements ' financial attacks .
