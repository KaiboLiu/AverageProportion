the educational level of part - time workers is generally relatively high , mainly engaged in technical work such as translation jobs , high proportion of part - time workers , and good health care personnel , reaching 61.66 percent .

it is understood that an hour job has become the main source of work experience accumulated by some graduates seeking jobs , and their experience in work training and skills to improve communication skills in society .
the graduates work for an hour mainly concentrates on those who have a strong knowledge and technical skills , such as those who have a strong professional translation position , highly modern performing arts positions , and their ratio to the total number of jobs in the translation and the age of jobs is 22.1 % and 26.8 % .
some hours of work are not required to be high in some skills , such as food promotion agents , marketing agents , etc. , and unemployed personnel can simply undergo training .

prc expert on us military threat in china , ' immeasurable '
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to provide assistance to the u.s. congress to help the chinese people understand the " four - year defense review report " which was submitted to congress a few days ago , which is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accusation against china 's normal national defense construction , playing on china 's military threat , and interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three paragraphs to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the way the united states should take to deal with china 's war of aggression or its war of china , which is directly involved in china or china 's directly wording , to say that the war of aggression , as a major and emerging power , is most likely to have the potential to compete with the united states , and if china does not have any countermeasure , it will be very destruc@@
yao yunzhu , a research fellow at the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials had expressed similar views on many occasions , this was the first time in the strategic report on china 's national defense strategy , that china is the emerging power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
the + suite report clearly defines for the first time the development of china as a emerging strategic opponent of russia , especially the so - called china military threat theory .
major general peng guangqian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " formally submitted , us president bush also submitted a report on the 2007 fiscal year to congress . the budget for defense spending has reached $ 439.3 - billion .
if it plus the military action to be carried out in iraq and afghanistan , the us budget for defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break through the $ 500 - billion mark , creating a new historical high . peng qian said that the us national defense budget will almost be equivalent to that of all other countries in the world in military spending .
peng guangqian believes that the us trick of creating a threat to other countries reflects the consistent style of the enemy in china , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and provide the vast arms industrial group in the united states with more profits .
the experts said that compared with the huge military expenditure of the united states , china 's defense expenditure is quite limited .
the military expert deng hongzhou , who had participated in several times in china 's national defense white papers , said that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditure has generally declined in the same period .
official statistics show that , compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for over half of the state 's fiscal expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense expenditure in 2005 was 244.656 billion yuan , only about one - tenth of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the people is only about one - sixty percent of that of the united states , and the per - capita military spending is about one - 30 of the us military 's .
the us area of its territory is roughly the same as china 's territory , but its military expenditure is so huge , and who is in fact more than the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guangqian said :
teng jianqun , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should objectively evaluate china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military opponents in the future .

hamas seeks new cabinet , says official
ramallah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas government has been trying to achieve a breakthrough in the cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , sept .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) , after winning the election of the legislative council , has drawn up a blueprint for the new government , which has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policy will hamas pursue will directly affect the peace process relevant parties ' policy orientation for the next step .
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has added variables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the parties in palestine are stepping up consultation to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points that involve future development in the cabinet .
who 's the prime minister 's office going to fall ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people outside the world worried that the supreme leader of hamas may have differences with abbas .
the hamas leader , marshall , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was founded by hamas , would not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal also intensified international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their disappointment with a hamas government that holds real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to the palestinian side .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent person is a policy that is correct .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition as much as possible , hamas , a domestic and foreign leader who is gathering in egypt , decided a few days ago to choose the independent leader of the islamic university of jamaica , maile wohadi , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts hossein said that no matter who will take office as prime minister , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should play down the hamas ' hardline flavor as much as possible , and only in this way can the success of the formation of the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to distribute power
within the party , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
an article carried by the palestine daily said that through social welfare projects , hamas has gathered people , but in the aspect of governance , it lacks experience and is not in a position to be compared with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has the governing experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing relations with fatah 's political partners and jointly forming a national coalition government . however , fatah has not given any positive response to this .
fatah is currently divided into two groups , one group stands for participating in the new government , and the other faction refuses hamas to invite it , and the other is willing to make a positive effort in the legislative yuan .
the source pointed out that , with abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually inclines to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to set up a legislative council to divorce itself from the party - affiliated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technical expert - type government is no exception a form of cabinet for reducing external pressure .
according to the stipulations of the " basic law " of palestine , after the new legislative council took office on 16 february , the work of nominating the premier and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
where will the armed forces go ?
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem facing the formation of a new government .
the united states and israel have taken a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in politics with its guns .
hamas leader mahmoud stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice made by the organization .
the question of armed force actually includes the legality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas was elected as the largest legislative party in the legislative council through democratic and free means , and has enabled its armed factions to do better in the sausan brigade , which is similarly legalized by itself , to unify it into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions of armed forces into a palestinian national authority , which is supported by the people , but did not receive a wide - ranging response , and was also criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad organization .
at present , palestine has over 60,000 security personnel and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fatah camp .
in addition , fatah also has some armed factions that are subordinate to the slocomd faction , like the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , the naha phia eagles of the affiliated fatah brigade .
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold discussions with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and rationally distribute security management authority .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense departments will be managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no news has been announced .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the power supply and demand situation and the successive commissioning of a large number of newly - built power generating units , the power safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional migration of seasonal period of power shortage will still exist , and the situation of supply and demand in some areas remains tight , and because the power - supply mechanism has not yet been formed , there still exist a fairly big problem in the supply of coal , and the problem of the decline in coal quality in electricity supply has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , the weak coal - supply structure , the outdated
shi yubo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed . how to maintain the stability of the contingent of workers and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the 2006 work on safety in electricity supply , shi yubo said that it is necessary to further consolidate the basic work of the management of power safety , speed up the establishment and improvement of the mechanism for emergency management of power safety , enhance the ability to deal with contingencies , strengthen the coordination and cooperation of power grid networks , jointly maintain the safety of the power system , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the dam and informationization , ensure the safety of the dam ,

south african envoy to china said that south africa does not exist in organized crime against chinese citizens .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african people 's republic of china ( south african ) will hold a reception here on the 13th to mark the 50 th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between south africa and china , said hao jianlin , commissioner of the south african embassy in china , in an exclusive interview with xinhua reporters .
he also said that the south african government will do everything possible to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
he said that the south african government hopes to reduce the rate of crime to zero and hopes that every person working in south africa will have a safe life and property .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a broad concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa on this issue and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention . overseas chinese compatriots have strengthened unity and friendship and cooperated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we express our most sincere sympathy and condolences to the families of victims .
" we are very sorry for this , " said fu kangning , adding that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case in which a chinese fujian woman chen jianqing was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hunting down another suspect .
according to another report , the south african embassy in china disclosed that the criminal who was suspected of shooting a hong kong businessman in january this year had been arrested by south african police and the property of the victims had been recovered .
when talking about the possible impact of the killing of chinese citizens , fukangning believes that these incidents indeed pose a serious threat to trade between the two countries and to trade between them in tourism and other fields , but from a long - term point of view , the influence should not be great enough to influence the country in the long term .
according to the commissioner of tourism of the south african embassy , the embassy provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists to more than 2,000 people in south africa in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics from china , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.277 - billion , up 23.0 percent from the same period last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the series of incidents of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have caused a marked increase in the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to south african tourism bureau statistics , in the first half of 2005 , 20,331 chinese tourists were traveling to south africa , a decrease of 14.9 percent compared with the same period last year .
currently , about 200,000 chinese living in south africa are living in towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of firearms in south africa have not been deterred by death , and therefore the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , cash and money with their family members will become the target of the criminal elements ' financial attack .

although italy has repeatedly ordered that the host country be found to have used the stimulant during the winter olympics , all athletes may face the immortal disaster of hell , but judging from various situations , such situations are not very likely to occur in this winter olympics for the first time .
turin winter olympic games exploded its first stimulant scandal since its opening on 16 february . orlea was found using banned substances .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that the sending of leifa had been quit from the winter olympics . she received two medals in the winter olympics , 15 kilometers per person , and was also deprived .

the ioc has always stipulated that athletes who have been found to have used stimulants in the olympic games will be disqualified and deprived of the qualification for the competition , but they will not be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by athletes is a criminal act and the judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimulants , and those who defy the law with the example of three months to three years are still subject to imprisoned .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after going through a year of bargaining , finally reached an agreement . both sides agreed to conduct negotiations on the basis of the italian law during this winter olympics to deal with the incident of athletes using stimulants .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , the italian side made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' residence during the winter olympics , but the medicinal pesticides would still be subjected to investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
it is reported that the italian government supervises the turin winter olympic games , pescantte , has already sent the doping agent to the dulingling procuratorial organ .
however , the international olympic committee and pescantay himself have not confirmed this .
russia 's second winter medal team medical , andreimov , revealed at noon on 17 february that pella had left turin and returned to the country .
