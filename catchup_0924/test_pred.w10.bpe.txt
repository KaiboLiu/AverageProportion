experts believe that the electr@@ on mag@@ ic insurance will not diver@@ t the domestic stock market funds in the short term .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " interim procedures on the management of foreign investment for insurance funds " were promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for use in the capital market .
liu le@@ fei , chief investment officer of china 's hu@@ an@@ ju company , said that the appreciation of the rmb and the good development of the domestic capital market will not be large - scale foreign investment , and this also means that insurance will not be dis@@ pers@@ ed to domestic stock markets in the short term .
the report says many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts say that since there is no such thing as the renminbi market , insurance institutions are not yet capable of taking ris@@ ky measures , the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , in the aspect of asset allocation , foreign investment should hold a certain proportion in the overall arrangement of insurance companies .
however , in view of the current high pressure on the appreciation of the rmb , china will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest abroad .
as for foreign exchange purchases and foreign investment , we should be cautious in dealing with them .

chen shui - bian cover@@ tly den@@ ies and demands that the " judicial yuan " to explain this .
chin@@ ane@@ ws , july 30 chen shui - bian questi@@ oned on 30 july the possibility of judicial personnel on the island trying to get involved in the taiwan region 's leader election .
taiwan 's wu@@ hang judicial institution 's administrative structure is high on the same day , and the current behavior of the island 's judges is not in con@@ form@@ ity with what chen shui - bian said , and he also asked chen shui - bian to give an explanation of his statement .
according to a report by taiwan 's " ci ju " [ name as transliterated ] , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge or investigation officer on 30 june , but he interven@@ ed in a campaign called " a referendum " because of political factors or election considerations . he even attempted to influence the campaign activities of various candidates of the political parties , saying that he hoped this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but that it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's question , taiwanese judicial premier j@@ ung yue does not respond to the call , but secretary general fan guang@@ q@@ un is still talking about the judicial affairs of the high representative office .
gao jin@@ zhi said : the basic law and the code of conduct of judges in taiwan all explicitly declared that judges should go beyond the party 's political parties and should not participate in party activities or help in the election . the judge was very cautious in observing relevant restrictions . he believed that judges would be very good at doing judicial work .
gao jin@@ chi pointed out that gao zh@@ ili@@ ang , a judge at the ga@@ o@@ xiong district , took part in the k@@ ai@@ da school training several years ago . because the relevant training courses were of political parties , the judge 's self - discipline committee made a resolution .
at one time , zhang sheng@@ xi wanted to take part in a dpp election because he was taking over his position and was also involved in a controver@@ sy about taking part in the election .
gao jin@@ zhi maintained that if a case is tried by a few cases , it is not possible to rule out by the judgment alone , and it is not possible to judge the judge 's victory by just relying on the outcome of the trial .
germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
xinhua news agency , july 1 , ber@@ lin ( by wang huai@@ cheng )
german education and scientific research minister sh@@ av@@ o said the other day that germany should reduce its " contingency plan " on the restrictions on foreign professional personnel . by increasing the introduction of foreign personnel , germany should solve the problem of professional talent in germany .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's labor force from 15 to 64 will decrease year by year .
if there is no enough migr@@ ation , then the labor force in 20@@ -@@ 06 will decrease by 6.@@ 0 percent compared with the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association reported that engine@@ ers ' professional skills were relatively well known in germany 's labor market .
according to statistics from the german federal labor bureau , in may this year , about 1.@@ 27@@ 27 million workers were employed in germany 's labor market , and about 9@@ ,@@ 600 technicians provided ru@@ b@@ ber services .
in order to protect the employment of their own people , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for the introduction of foreign talent .
germany 's " che fa " stipulates that non - eu professional personnel are not allowed to work in germany less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot be granted the permission to work and residence in germany .
sh@@ am@@ el@@ a suggested that this limit be lowered to the original level to reach still the euro .
prc scholar says falungong not to practice super@@ sti@@ tion laws ;
the " law on lawyers " recently submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval stipulates in article 8 that lawyers who once engaged in specialized work such as legal studies and teaching , and who possess advanced or similar professional standards , applied for practi@@ sing as lawyers , shall be examined and approved by the judicial administrative departments of the state council and be allowed to practi@@ se their profession .
( june 28 , " china " )
there is a theoretical circle , but there is no need to separate legal systems from the management of the actual operation field . the former includes legal teaching and research work , and the latter is more engaged in legal legal proceedings , legal consultations , legal service , and other specific behaviors .
for a long time , there exists a certain gap between legal experts , theoretical experts , and practical work units . for a long time , there is a phenomenon of l@@ acking necessary manpower and management skills , and the theory is a mechan@@ ic rule .
the legal system can do so with such division of labor , but not by providing support to any party .
however , the controlling stock@@ pil@@ ing of the " law of lawyers " has obj@@ ectively recognized the legal profession , which is higher than the legal profession . the judgment is that the legal profession is not a legal profession .
in fact , some experts engaged in such purely theoretical research and teaching activities as legal systems , international laws , and so on , have been closely linked to the legal practice .
in this way , the + x@@ uan [ name as transliterated ] legal system has no doubt created an extremely bad influence on the legal affairs circles ' quali@@ fication for the work is no doubt a bad gu@@ y .
super@@ sti@@ tion in the theoretical circle is not just like these , for example , experts and experts have often been deb@@ ating about the possibility of rej@@ ecting court verdic@@ ts , but is also a direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers terror attack and welcomes dispat@@ ching troops
xinhua news agency , july 5 , london ( by guo lin )
the british government has reduced the number of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the serious level , which indicates that the terrorist attacks in britain will not happen , but there is still possibility that the attacks will still be killed .
at present , the british police have shif@@ ted the investigation scope to india and australia .
since the eight arrested terrorist attack suspects are working in the medical system , the government will give a full - time evaluation of the background of migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly one - third of people working in britain 's public health system are overseas .

the down@@ ward trend of tourism is the lo@@ ose one , the most comfor@@ table one is the natural civilization of the country and society .
however , many people have experienced such worries when they travel in the country , and some are being dr@@ ag@@ ged by traders and intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is a car or a train , the tr@@ uck has to en@@ counter some small traders ' death penalty with no - license intermedi@@ aries .
it is not selling off the ban@@ yan j@@ ade c@@ akes , and it is selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then introducing the intermedi@@ ary cat@@ ering service bu@@ t@@ ter and drink , even the false pr@@ ay@@ er .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is very un@@ successful that he will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some storms , many of them have the same feeling .
before entering the gate , some people came to the foot of the river or some other things , such as the mountain , the little fl@@ ower , or the little , or the little , the other .
after entering the house , this situation will be even more , and no matter how good y@@ a@@ xing is , it is also exposed to the bad .
some media reports said that many foreign tourists who visited xian were very appreci@@ ative of the mon@@ uments there , but they were allowed to have more h@@ iding pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers everywhere .
including the tur@@ tle of the ru@@ sh@@ es , which are like the wind , the wind , the wind , and the fl@@ ower , should be civilized , orderly , harmonious , and harmonious , and give a gr@@ ac@@ eful environment to the heart .
the free flow of traders , sti@@ r@@ ring up the gr@@ iev@@ ances , obj@@ ectively destroying these public order , and forming a pollution and a pollution caused by the pollution of the environment . at the same time , it also provides objective conditions and conditions for the market .
what is important is that these grass - roots units are the wind@@ ows for the building of spiritual civilization in the loc@@ ality . what they are damaged is not only the image issue , but also the impact on local economic development .
just think , if you want to make the tourism industry strong , you will use this kind of chao@@ tic and m@@ ess tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests coming from the south and north . who is willing to come , who da@@ res to come ?
how can your tourism economy obtain benefits ?
with the peak tourist season coming , a civilized city has been created for tourists from the north and south . it should be said that it is a top priority task .
he@@ y is not a market , the business behavior of the pe@@ d@@ d@@ lers of small business firms should be standardized , operations without a license should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
only a civilized and orderly environment can make it happy to come , go back , and flour@@ ish again .

prc scholar says no reward for taiwan 's reform on its own initiative
the construction of x@@ iz@@ ang street in dong@@ cheng district , beijing , used as a method to distribu@@ te electricity to the 12 households that have retired from insurance .
( " xin jing bao " 10 july )
i am glad to see the improvement of these families ' lives , but i still have some opinions on the proposal of volun@@ t@@ arily with@@ drawing back from the original family . there is also a complicated practice of awar@@ ding the residents .
ji@@ u@@ xiang city cpc committee deputy director said that in view of such problems as the arbitr@@ ary de@@ frau@@ ding of minimum guarantee , encouraging the dis@@ miss@@ al of insurance on a voluntary basis is a model that other households should set for the low insurance burden .
this example would encourage other low - income people to extr@@ icate themselves from their difficulties through their own efforts , and it would indeed be wor@@ th@@ while to encourage those low - income people to de@@ fraud through dec@@ eption if they were to use this to save them .
in the work of differ@@ enti@@ ating and sor@@ ting out low - income households , the law is more dependent on them .
the departments concerned should strengthen the responsibility of the minimum guarantee households to fulfill their obligations when enjoying the minimum guarantee : if they report the changes in their family members and income , report their employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination , then the departments concerned should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , it is not the long - term plan to withdraw from the law .
the neighbor@@ hood comm@@ end@@ ation for retired families is made by who bur@@ ied their contracts .
as a first - level government organization , the streets are charged with the expenditure of the funds .
the tax@@ pay@@ er should not have fl@@ ower .
on the one hand , the families that with@@ drew from the minimum guarantee have proved that they have certain self - suffici@@ ency ability , and on the other hand , do they still not still have the ability to apply for low protection ?
the government financial appropri@@ ations , which are called life - saving money , should be provided with char@@ coal in the snow , not in the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu , who is willing to serve as a service person , is even more
on 10 july , the first public opinion poll conducted in ji@@ ul@@ an town in ji@@ u@@ ji township , xin@@ du district , throughout the country , liu gang@@ yi accepted democratic opinions for the fourth time after assuming office . the rate of satisfaction at the head office reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
during the talks between reporters and liu gang@@ yi , liu gu@@ an@@ yi defined himself as a service member .
( yesterday 's " beijing news " )
liu gang@@ yi 's service for the account@@ ant may be more than the appointment of some cadres , who serve the service , but it is more true and even more conv@@ inc@@ ing .
the most important thing in the system of directly elec@@ ting cadres is the decision by ordinary party members on the source of power , and the latter is mainly determined by higher - level organization and appointment , and the direction of the source of power , which determin@@ es that the former must put the responsibility for the people in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom are the fundamental factors determining how the candidate will carry out his work .
some people doubt that this kind of democracy , the still more like a demonstration of democracy , is like a hill .
my view is that there is such a democracy , which is better than not .
given the history and current situation of democratic political construction at the grassroots level in china , i believe that the promotion of direct elections is a major breakthrough , and democracy is a major component part of the primary democratic system , which should not be under@@ estimated in promoting the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level .

par@@ che is the first female presidential candidate in indian history . if she is elected , she will become india 's first female president .
pa@@ ol is the presidential candidate of the ruling national congress party , while sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ at is from the opposition people 's party .
because the congress party holds a leading position in the presidential election , media and the people are busy running , the possibility of being elected is quite high .
the 72 - year - old girl was named " la pr@@ ay@@ a state female governor " .
she has rich experience in serving as a deputy to the national assembly , and she has been warmly welcomed by the government during her term as the president of the l@@ ag@@ ar state .
she also devoted herself to social welfare , and was the honor@@ ary chairman of many cultural and social welfare organizations .
analysts pointed out that the reason why par@@ a became a candidate was that she always held a r@@ ough meeting with indian national congress party chairman s@@ onia g@@ and@@ hi .
in india , the ken@@ yan family has controlled the ruling national congress party for a long time .
par@@ che was bad@@ ly be@@ at@@ en by a large number of female voters . the voters believe that par@@ e will play a role in the indian female + image that dis@@ crimin@@ ates against the serious concept of women .

prc military uni@@ formed desig@@ ner invited to visit chin@@ ad@@ ail@@ y@@ .@@ com@@ .@@ c@@ n
on july 13 th , this newspaper , beijing , reporter yang bao@@ jin liu xin@@ xin reported that the pla units will replace the traditional uni@@ form of 2007 with the new uni@@ form starting from august 1 st .
tonight , the chinese military network invited the military supplies department deputy director chen jun and m@@ ai jun , deputy director of the armament bureau , and senior engine@@ er of the military equipment research institute , su yang , who is the archit@@ ect of the 2007 military uni@@ form , to visit the chinese military w@@ ire , and to discuss the background and process of developing the new uni@@ form of ne@@ tiz@@ ens from inside and outside the military . this aroused re@@ perc@@ ussions among ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the direct master design and development of the military uni@@ form .
when talking about the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 07 - style uni@@ form is a special military uni@@ form formed formed by the military uni@@ form of 97 , and the series of military uni@@ forms are still in the category of " syn@@ thes@@ es " and " series of composite pul@@ ling " .
the greatest characteristic of the 07 style uni@@ form is the effect of putting the dem@@ arc@@ ation line into effect the requirement of person@@ alization so that our military uni@@ form has reached the standard of having a series of supporting functions for three branches of the armed forces , and symbol@@ izes that the level of building of our military uni@@ form has been achieved by a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the types of the new uni@@ form , such as the x@@ ili@@ ang style military uni@@ form , and the " mini three " [ wei fu ] , which is still short of the original name of the ne@@ tiz@@ en .

jing@@ jiang city people 's armed forces platform to upgrade quality of military cadres
prc : zhu chun@@ ping on zhu chun@@ ping , 18 june , a " three stresses " education activity for cadres of wen@@ jiang city in jiangsu province , was organized by lu yu@@ qing , director of the armed forces department of x@@ ili@@ ang town , to give guidance on " winning a psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " . the course was unanimously accepted by the cad@@ ets .
this is a test of the strength of the personnel and the armed forces department in integrating the actual situation with the work of rein@@ forcing the overall quality of the armed forces cadres .
at the beginning of this year , when conducting investigations and studies at the grassroots level , the party committee of the armed forces department discovered that some cadres of the armed forces ' speci@@ alist units have served in a cadre 's posts , and have been serving in a political position .
for this reason , they have adopted methods such as concentrated training on the sid@@ elines of the meeting and regular training of specialized military cadres , and focused efforts on resolving problems such as insufficient professional knowledge and lack of professional quality for specialized military cadres .
in connection with the central work , they have boldly assigned tasks to special cadres , thus enhancing their ability to serve their posts .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " plan for the appointment of specialized military cadres by bidding for posts by specialized military units . " the director of the armed forces must enter the party committee leadership group and not assume other duties .
the military region has established a mechanism for adjustment and exchange of cadres to conduct investigation and study on some specialized military cadres who are not quite well - educated to meet the needs of the grassroots units . comrades who have good comprehensive quality and ability to do work should be promoted and appointed .
not long ago , chen yi@@ song , director of the armed forces department of the new century limited , led the militi@@ a technical detachment to innovate in and develop under@@ water vessels . he was upgraded to the minister of the company 's armed forces .
good will start with good , and good will end up in the end
just as the result of the competition is concerned , the score of 2 - 2 is reasonable and also acceptable , and the key is the competition process , so how much regret is .
if iran leads the team 2 to 0 , then it equ@@ als , then that does not feel that china is a very different feeling , and it will be very long . it is the opposite situation of morale .
the only thing that can not be done is to remove one old thing .
i often cannot play or play under the situation , but the general view is that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a reason why i cannot stick well .
however , judging from today 's competition , it seems that it is not all that .
sun ji@@ xiang , sun ji@@ aq@@ i@@ ang , a former deputy director of the ji@@ ao@@ ji temple , said that li wei feng and others had not said in europe and were also old gener@@ als of the s@@ and field . they had seen many things and said that their psychological quality would not have any problem .
the ir@@ ian team was forced to settle down by the iranian team , probably because it would be a task to dispatch troops .
the iranian team was in a back@@ war@@ dness and was replaced by two people , and the scene was immediately cut off .
after i got off the line , i also changed three names , but the effect was not good .
we must find a correct way to solve the problem that is not right at the beginning .
as long as the problem is accurately located , it is not difficult to find the problem and change the problem .
they are afraid of being un@@ treated and hosp@@ ital@@ ized .
if you go on like this , you will k@@ ick out more games , and if you go down , you will go wrong , and you cannot talk about what everyone exp@@ ects .
