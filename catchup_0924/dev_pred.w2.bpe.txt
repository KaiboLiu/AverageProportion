he has participated in many times in the military affairs experts ' study of china 's national defense white paper , saying that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national defense expenditures in the same period has shown a trend of decline .
the official figures show that in 2004 , the volume of trade between china 's national defense expenditures and the country 's financial expenditures for the same period dropped nearly 10 percentage points .
in 2005 , china 's defense spending was 24@@ 4.@@ 6 - billion yuan , up by only a very small proportion of the us military spending , and the per capita military spending was only about one - fourth of the us 's total military spending , and the per capita military spending was about one - thir@@ ty .

peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , china 's peaceful development , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china threat theory " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and is implementing a defensive national defense policy .
china has been in the past and is not in the future to pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military alli@@ ances with any other country , nor has it provided military bases to other countries .
professor zhang de@@ jiang of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should , through the established channels , increase communication and exchanges , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively advance the sino - us constructive and cooperative relationship in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

us commercial crude oil prices rise to new high
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( by staff reporter yang cheng@@ wu ) hamas has sought a breakthrough in its cabinet , but the government has not yet been able to achieve any breakthrough in its plan to form a new government .
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 26 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won a majority in the legislative election , and how to draw a new blueprint for the government has become a major issue of concern to the world at present .
hamas to implement what kind of new policy will directly affect the peace process the parties concerned will take corresponding measures in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has also added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the " three stresses " education is the most important thing in the past .
hamas won the right to form a cabinet , and some people are worried that hamas 's prime minister might be linked with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the us president , who is visiting egypt , mu@@ shar@@ af , stressed that the organization of the palestinian new government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal will also intensify the international community 's concern .
the united states and israel have clearly expressed their dis@@ agreement on not accepting a hamas government that has the real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid and provide economic aid to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making a flexible policy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition to the maximum , a few days ago , hamas 's domestic and foreign leaders decided to select an independent person , k@@ ash@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of j@@ a@@ af@@ ar@@ i , to serve as a new prime minister .
this move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that the palestinian authority has always been in a state of emergency no matter who has the prime minister 's post , and the most crucial thing is that the candidate of the prime minister should be as tough as possible . only by so doing can we ensure the success of the cabinet .
the " three represents " are the basic principles for the distribution of power and the distribution of power .
in terms of internal affairs , hamas is facing a most difficult challenge in forming a cabinet , and it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the " daily news " of palestine carried an analysis saying that hamas has been trying to achieve its goal of building a harmonious society through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and is in@@ timate with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience in governing .
hamas has been putting forward a proposal to hold a new dialogue with fat@@ ah , which is aimed at establishing a nation@@ alist coalition government with fat@@ ah . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah 's internal problems are not yet clear .
the informed person@@ age pointed out that under the leadership of ab@@ b@@ as , the fat@@ ah movement has gradually le@@ an@@ ed into the new government .
even so , hamas has not been able to reach a consensus with fat@@ ah on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , the other way is to form a framework of the legislative committee , which is divor@@ ced from the party 's nature .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clear - cut plan for the united states to use its own human rights system to carry out its activities .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel are also not satisfied with the technical expert - type government , the united states has not yet formed a cabinet - forming mechanism to reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the palestinian national authority will hold a general election on 16 february after the new legislative council takes office .
the " three represents " are the best choice for armed forces .
the hamas 's weapons are the most important and most important task in the formation of the new government .
the united states and israel have taken a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in government .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ ass@@ ad stressed on 9 july that the resistance was the result of the organization 's strategic choice .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the leg@@ ality of the armed forces .
hamas 's efforts to achieve the goal of a political settlement through democracy and freedom have won the international recognition , and the armed forces under it have also been tor@@ n away .
hamas once proposed to bring all armed forces into a new state of palestinian national authority , and the armed forces of the people of palestine have not received widespread response , and has also been attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ay@@ d ) .
palestine currently has 6@@ 0,000 troops in security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of them came from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah 's other members also have some lo@@ ose relations with the armed police , and some other people under the jurisdiction of ak@@ sa marty@@ rs , including the mal@@ ic@@ ious ri@@ th@@ i@@ i@@ i@@ di , etc.
the us federal council , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must cooperate with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of all political parties , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police , and civil defense agencies , while the new government 's interior ministry is under the charge of the agency .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no decision has been made .
