experts said that because of the lack of renminbi + or@@ ion products , insurance institutions have not been able to avoid risks , so the time for large - scale purchases of foreign currencies is not yet ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said : over the long term , the state has made considerable headway in the allocation of assets . in the overall arrangement of insurance companies , foreign investments should account for a certain proportion .
however , in view of the fact that the rmb has a greater pressure of appreciation , china 's ep@@ ist@@ og@@ ue will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to make investments abroad .
the government has taken into account the fact that foreign exchange purchase is conducted overseas and should take care of it at present .

the chinese new website , july 1 , chen shui - bian , questi@@ oned the attempt of judicial personnel on the island to interven@@ e in the election of leaders in the taiwan region .
the taiwan judicial department 's executive department has displayed its unique features , and added to it that the performance of judges on the island is not in keeping with chen shui - bian 's words , and has demanded chen shui - bian to explain his statements .
according to a report by taiwan 's " zheng du@@ an " [ preceding acr@@ on@@ y@@ m in english ] on 30 june , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the judge 's l@@ ac@@ tic and investig@@ ators , because of political factors or election considerations , interven@@ ed in and even attempted to influence the election campaign activities of various party candidates , saying that he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it was very likely that it would be very difficult .

germany to cut down professional talent import thre@@ sh@@ old
the reporter of the pla 's ber@@ lin 1 july ( reporter wang hu@@ cheng )
germany 's education and scientific research minister sh@@ au@@ v@@ in said that germany should lower its " gos@@ p@@ el " to provide support for introducing foreign professional personnel and increase the degree of depend@@ ence on foreign talent to resolve the issue of professional talent in germany .
according to the agreement , the german - made household reached the age of 15 to 64 , and the number of labor@@ ers aged between 15 and 64 will drop year by year .
if there is no sufficient immigration , by 20@@ :@@ 00 , the labor force in germany will be reduced by 6@@ -@@ 0 percent compared with the present .
however , german employer union and german engine@@ er association reported that the number of people who are working in germany at present was more than professional technicians .
according to the statistics of the federal labor service , in may this year , the engine@@ er supply quantity in the german labor market increased by approximately 1@@ 27@@ ,000 , with the technical personnel suppl@@ ying approximately 9@@ 600 people .
germany has made great efforts to protect its own people 's employment and has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " mon@@ tre@@ al law " stipulates that the professional personnel from non - eu countries can not be less than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain employment and residence permits .
sh@@ am@@ man suggested to include this restriction to + or@@ th@@ ul@@ ated euro .
do not have super@@ sti@@ tion in laws , and speak up in theory
recently , the draft law on the protection of lawyers ' rights and interests was submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation , which stipulates : professional work such as conducting legal research , such as fl@@ ash@@ y teaching , and other professional work , and personnel with high level or professional standards , who apply for lawyers ' practice , may be approved by the judicial administration department of the state council .
( june 28 , " china 's daw@@ n " )
the law has a cl@@ ue of theory and ver@@ tical and show@@ case , but the former is divided into two parts : legal teaching and research work , and so on , while the latter is engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation , legal consultancy , legal service , specific behavior , specific behavior , etc.
for a long time , the law , theory , and the actual operation , there exist ver@@ gl@@ os@@ sy among man , ver@@ tically , and l@@ um@@ ber , and the theory circle believes that the household , real , l@@ acking essential , dres@@ sing , only the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the machine , the auth@@ or , and the auth@@ or of the ver@@ se , the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of the critical and critical critical critic@@ isms from the theoretical circle , were not practical theoretical guidance .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to this difference of division of labor .
however , the law of lawyers has become a hot spot in the ver@@ ge of the law , but obj@@ ectively it has recognized the law , super@@ ficial , and superior legal , and unified judg@@ ement .
in fact , some people who engage in legal system and international laws are purely ver@@ tical theories and teaching , and their teaching strategies are res@@ our@@ c@@ eful and real , but they are also cl@@ og@@ ged in legal affairs .
this way , the spo@@ tted lawyers will undoubtedly become a law , a huge market , and the actual qualifications of lawyers are very poor .
right , the theory industry , and the super@@ sti@@ tion of the theory are not limited to these , such as experts ' and expert demonstration will often affect or even rej@@ ect the verdic@@ t of the court , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of this super@@ sti@@ tion .

to further promote the development of the shipping industry in our country , the ro@@ t@@ ating whe@@ els of china have attracted much attention from the international shipping industry , and the fact that a considerable number of ships engaged in international navigation have registered and ho@@ ist@@ ed outside china and have been issued recently the " public announcement on implementing the special registration policy for international shipping companies in the implementation of special shipping application " has clearly stated the conditions of the special case and the application procedures for special approval , and the application procedures

the british aim in reducing terrorist attacks is to reduce the level of sc@@ at@@ tering .
the reporter learned from the general office of the pla that the pla has made a great effort to build a new type of aircraft in the new century .
the british government 's cl@@ og@@ ues hit the or@@ ion and dropped from the highest level to the severe dragon level , indicating that the uk 's terrorist attacks will not happen soon . the attacks will still not be over@@ weight .
at present , the british police have transferred the scope of the investigation to india and australia .
as the arrested person was suspected of being involved in the medical system , the government will carry out a comprehensive investigation into the migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that nearly tw@@ el@@ ve such large cases of tor@@ ture were reported in overseas countries .
prime minister sh@@ o@@ e also demanded that the ti@@ ps of high - tech immigrants be investigated , and the employers or relevant organizations are required to provide information on the background of the cl@@ oud .
the reason why the traders are so ti@@ red is that
the number of tourists travel@@ ing is lo@@ os@@ er , and it is the largest one .
however , the number of travel@@ ers in china has been hit by this kind of worry , and it has been exposed to the market by the commercial deal@@ ers and deal@@ ers as intermedi@@ ary businesses .
no matter whether the automobile or the train is in the ver@@ ge , they always en@@ counter the pe@@ t@@ ty business deal@@ ers and some intermedi@@ ary without a certificate .
it is not selling or@@ ang@@ e , spr@@ aying c@@ akes , but selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and many un@@ certified intermedi@@ ary agencies , cat@@ ering , and even super@@ markets , fake and sh@@ od@@ dy products .
you can not accept it , he can catch you for several hundred meters , and you are very un@@ successful .
in some scen@@ ic spots , many ver@@ ta@@ iling and dres@@ sing experiences also have the same feeling .
the maximum penalty for the offence is a tourist burden and a small fo@@ g .
we went to the door , and this situation became more .
zeng qinghong , a reporter of the chinese academy of social sciences , said : many foreign tourists in xi@@ '@@ an have expressed their appreciation for xian 's mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous and un@@ yiel@@ ding views . however , they have never understood the fact that allowing many small sh@@ oes to rise up again .
these include the cl@@ og@@ ging of the various kinds of stor@@ ies , such as the cl@@ oud , and how it should be + orderly , orderly , qu@@ iet , and calm , giving out a broad and broad - minded environment .
the commercial deal@@ er 's freedom , ju@@ g@@ gl@@ ed and filled up stor@@ ies , obj@@ ectively destroyed these " tri@@ fl@@ es " public order , formed a chain of pollution and environmental pollution , and also provided a cl@@ oud condition and opportunity for it to produce its goods .
the important thing is that these cr@@ oo@@ ked goods are the wind@@ ows for the construction of local spiritual civilization , and they are all - round ones , and the damaged are not only an image problem , but also will have an impact on local economic development .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to be a strong tourist industry , you will use this dis@@ orderly and d@@ ul@@ l tourist environment to gre@@ et the guests from the south to the north , and who will dare come ?
you have a good tourism economy , and how can you obtain benefits ?
with the development of tourism , the tourism industry has brought a lot of opportunities to tourists from the north and south of the country . it should be said that the top priority is to create a civilized tourist environment .
the number of people who are not market - oriented and small - sized h@@ ad@@ ley should be standardized , and the un@@ qualified business should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down on .
a civilized , orderly environment is the only way to let the see@@ ds feel happy and return to the good , to the good , and to hu@@ ar@@ ong .

this writ@@ er has done a lot of work for the improvement of family life , but it is still very easy to bear such promises and can also use the practices of giving encour@@ agement to the household .
the construction of streets and streets was completed in mid - autumn , with stress dec@@ eption and low protection , the deputy director of the jian@@ cheng street office said , adding that it was an example of other low - income households .
this example , if we encourage other low - income employees to take part in the difficult situation through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating . if we want to use this to turn the s@@ ag@@ ac@@ ious and sh@@ am@@ eful people who have long been che@@ ating low - quality insurance , this is not something n@@ ai@@ ve .
in the course of differ@@ enti@@ ating and sor@@ ting out low - yield households , more depend@@ ed on the law .
the departments concerned should strengthen the management of low - income households in keeping with their minimum guarantee : if the situation war@@ r@@ ants in a timely manner , the situation of the changes in family members and income , the situation of employment , and the time of peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ trial , the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , the flow of the products and the protection of the products according to law is a long - term measure .
the street has a right to protect the household from such a fur@@ y , and the one who bur@@ ied it ?
the street , as a primary government organization , has a financial appropri@@ ation to undertake its expenditures .
the water level of tax@@ pay@@ ers should not be fl@@ ower ?
on the one hand , the number of families who have with@@ drawn from the low insurance system prov@@ es that they have certain self - compl@@ i@@ ant capability , and on the other hand , the number of people applying for low - guarantee does not exist ?

the us department of food and drug administration published a safety warning in may this year , sugg@@ esting di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to use their language carefully , because scientists published a series of " xin zhen medical journal " on 21 may , which said that this kind of sur@@ ging drugs would greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence and weight of patients with heart diseases .

the number of us troops deployed in iraq in january and february this year was only 50 and 73 , respectively .
these bad respon@@ ses were less than water bu@@ b@@ ble , and were even more sudden to heart attack .
however , the us drug authority 's drug experts believe that the current conclusion is that the im@@ proper treatment of di@@ ya is still so@@ oner than it is .
the drug authority will issue a new licence to the public on july 30 .
in 1999 , the man di@@ ya was a cre@@ ature of pan@@ cre@@ in . it was used to c@@ ure the spo@@ t@@ light .
the world has about 6 million di@@ a@@ be@@ tics patients who have taken or are taking di@@ y@@ re@@ tic .

in the world , the world 's small and small military forces , although their military uni@@ forms have basically the same uses , there is no difference between military uni@@ forms of any two countries .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .

in the cour@@ ty@@ ard , she often shou@@ ted and shou@@ ted " l@@ augh@@ ter " in three categories , showing the strength of a military con@@ qu@@ est , and the uni@@ form , like the be@@ au@@ ty , was the best one .

the previous few years , with the staff and the cl@@ er@@ ical staff of this group , some of the houses were un@@ authorized and over@@ taken , making the current cadres ' housing difficulties , and the officers and men have a rather strong opinion on this .
the group also had a few times of housing , and all had to wait until the obstacles were cle@@ ared , thus turning this problem into an old problem .
the only way to compar@@ e the reality is to say how to solve the difficult problems , but how to turn the tri@@ fl@@ es into the tri@@ fl@@ es .
the new government 's leading body of the party committee reached a consensus , and the principal leaders personally gathered together to start thoroughly clean@@ ing up all the problems of occup@@ ying houses in violation of rules and regulations .

jing@@ gang@@ zhou city people 's armed services department elev@@ ated its quality to improve its ability
the pla general political department held a demonstration hall in honor of the officers and men of the armed police force in jing@@ jiang city on 18 june . the armed forces department head of xi@@ he town lu yu@@ qing gave lectures on " winning the psychological warfare under inform@@ ati@@ zed conditions " and received the support of the train@@ ees participating in the training .
this is a typical example of the combination of the functions of the unit with the reality of its own position , and the emphasis is on raising the overall quality of the officers and men .
this year , the man 's armed forces department party committee made a report to the grass - roots level during investigation and study . it discovered that some specialized wu cadre had become mature and mature , and they concurrently shoulder duties , and they failed to put their main energ@@ ies on the work of arming the armed forces .
to this end , they have adopted the method of concentrated training , using the c@@ os@@ pon@@ sor@@ ed training , relying on local party schools to train specialized cadres at regular inter@@ vals , and focusing on resolving the problem of the lack of knowledge of wu cadres and the uni@@ form professional quality of the professional work .
in light of the central work , we have boldly assigned cadres to perform ta@@ st@@ y tasks , and through work posts , we have enhanced our ability to work in office .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments , jointly formulated the " regulations on the competitive appointment of military cadres , " explicitly stipul@@ ating that armed forces ministers must go into the party committee teams and no longer look at other positions .
the establishment of a system for readjusting and exchanging military cadres has made new and effective adjustments to the work of armed forces at the grassroots level , which is not so old and is not so much so much so that cadres with good overall quality and good work ability can be promoted and used .
not long ago , the xin@@ century daw@@ n company , ltd. , and the director - general of the armed forces company , chen yi@@ song , led the militi@@ a 's innovative under@@ water ship technology team to fill up the cr@@ op in china and elev@@ ate it to the director of the armed forces department of the company .
good at still still needs to be done well
the number of entr@@ ies in the competition alone is 2 to 2 , which is reasonable and also + one able to accept . the key is the process of the competition , and how many regre@@ ts are .
if it is the iran team 2 - 0 , then the wind will equ@@ ate the bu@@ c@@ ks , and give china 's feeling is definitely different , it will be very long and high morale , and the situation is opposite .
good at the beginning , we cannot end with good , but we can say that it is a thing of infer@@ i@@ ority .
the number of people who work in the wake of the daw@@ n of the world is often not high .
this is indeed a fl@@ esh that cannot be spo@@ tted , and a good thing can be accomplished .
however , from the daw@@ n competition today , the s@@ now@@ fall seems to be quite bad .
sun ji@@ hai 's movement , sun xing@@ xiang , sh@@ ao ji@@ ach@@ eng , and zheng zhi@@ zhi , who had k@@ ic@@ ked a ball in europe , were also a long - time play@@ er in the s@@ and field . they knew things in a broad sense . they could not solve any problem in their psychological quality .
the purpose of this sort of over@@ thr@@ owing was forced to co@@ ol the iranian team , which probably would turn into a tri@@ fl@@ ing force and turn it into a mon@@ um@@ ul@@ ous one .
iran 's team is still in a backward condition , and the two men are on the same ro@@ tation .
the number of people who were trained in the lower half of the hall was also three , but the effect was not good .
we should overcome the mentality of being in@@ different to the beginning and should accurately find the root of the problems .
as long as the problem is accurately identified , the methods for re@@ dres@@ sing the problem will probably not be difficult to find .
they are afraid of being suddenly dr@@ ag@@ ged into a hospital .
if this goes on , what one wants is to k@@ ick up more competition , and what is wrong is always that he will commit mistakes , and what everybody wants is to play a more game .
