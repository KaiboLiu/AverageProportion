chinese expert : american prizes china military threat
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government and people 's association for promoting democracy ( cfa ) have agreed to provide more assistance to the united states in the military field , said here today
experts believe that this is a test of china 's normal national defense construction , which exaggerates the military threat from china , and interferes in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is the new national defense document of the pentagon .
the report , which has a total of 92 pages , expounded in three chapters on the question of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , in a total of 15 times , directly mentioned two terms in the sino - us relations , which were cloned over between china and france or between china , saying that it is a major and emerging power , that china has the greatest potential to conduct military competition with the united states , and that china may develop its military superiority in
the world military science research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yunzhu , said : although senior us military officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions , this is the first time that the us defense strategy report has put forward in the defense strategy report that china is the emerging power which may most challenge the united states military .
this year 's report clearly will for the first time link russia 's accession to the world trade organization , india 's emerging strategic opponent , especially the so - called china military threat theory , to pay more attention to the menace .
the chinese military is a strategic partner of china .
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " submitted , the united states president bush also briefed congress on the fiscal year 2007 .
if you add this to the fact that the military operations in iraq and afghanistan are to be added , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , a new historical high , qu guangqian said , " this is almost the same as that of other countries in the world , " said kaifu .
peng guangqian said : the american speculation that besieged other countries ' threat reflects the consistent style of the pentagon fabricating enemies in jewelry , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to make more profits for the us arms industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has been involved in the writing of china 's national defense white paper many times , deng hongzhou said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a decline .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the number of chinese national defense expenditures accounted for over 20 percent of the state 's fiscal expenditures in the same period .
china 's national defense budget for 2005 was 244.656 billion yuan , only equivalent to about one - third of the us national defense budget , and the per capita military spending was only about one - sixtieth of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of military personnel was about one - thirds of that of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area and china 's territory are roughly equal , but its military spending is so huge , and who in the end is the military force that exceeds the legitimate defense needs . this goes without saying .
peng guangqian said :
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jianqun said that the united states should objectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not imply that china and the united states will become rivals militarily in the future .
the 2004 edition of china 's national defense says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never experienced any tumultuous changes in the past and in the future .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries .
professor huang jiashu of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century in order to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

china , hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang haohuang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a new government blueprint has become the focus of international attention .
hamas will pursue what kind of new policy will directly affect the peace process the parties concerned will have their own policy orientation in the next step .
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has added more variables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficult and sensitive points in forming a cabinet which will affect future development .
the chinese premier 's position has come to a certain family
hamas won the ruling of forming a cabinet , some people in the outside world worried that prime minister hamas might have differences with the current supreme leader abbas .
and is in egypt .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed not to accept a hamas government which has real power , and thus threatened to suspend economic aid for palestine and handed over tax to palestine .
however , this does not hamper hamas ' flexible strategic adjustment , the election of an independent person is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , hamas , domestic and foreign leaders who gathered in egypt recently , decided to elect an independent hamas member , qalehar al-najah , chairman of the governing board of the islamic college .
this move has not yet received the response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hossein , said that regardless of the place where the premier vacates , the most important thing is that the candidate for prime minister should as much as possible lessen hamas 's tough color , and only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
the chinese government and people have always paid close attention to the issue of how to distribute power .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governing .
the palestinian newspaper " daily " analyzes that hamas has been trying to get together people with social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has gained experience in ruling palestine .
hamas has proposed a new security alliance with fatah after the election , and has worked together with fatah to establish a national coalition government . however , fatah has not given a positive response to this .
fatah is currently in a state of opinion on whether to join the cabinet . the one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus getting something done , and the other faction refuses to invite hamas to act as a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually leans toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah also will hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative committee framework , which is separated from the party .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but it is not known what the specific name list is .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also not to be formed as a way to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will nominate the prime minister and form the cabinet after the new legislative council takes office on 16 june .
the chinese armed forces are now in a state of mind .
the weapons in hamas are to form a new government , and the new government is facing another thorny problem .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough stance and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to use their guns to participate in politics .
hamas leader mahathir stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a binding strategic choice of the organization .
armed issues actually include the legality of weapons and the management of armed forces .
hamas has been fighting for the palestinian people by means of democracy and freedom .
hamas has proposed to send all factions into a palestinian national authority , and the people can hardly meet the need of the palestinian people . however , it has not received a wide response . it has also been criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad organization ( jihad ) .
at present , palestine has 60,000 security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah also has some loose organizational relations with a number of subordinate armed factions , such as the martyrs shyan in aqiq brigade , the tie of the falusi , etc.
the cabinet - forming hamas must hold talks with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that are each running its own government and rationally distribute the right to manage security .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations in the new government , and the interior ministry is in charge of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no word has been written .
