according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently , shanghai 's h@@ our@@ ly workers have exceeded 1 million .
according to a zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao report , college graduates and part - time workers are the major components of the hour work@@ force .
through direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the personnel were part - time workers , and the proportion was 5@@ 1.@@ 11 percent .

and to satisfy his own interest in expanding his knowledge , he also has an important reason for his part - time work .
for example , mr. gu , who works as a human resources manager in a certain enterprise , would take a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign representative office .
mr ko@@ o believed that the biggest benefits of part - time jobs were to keep up@@ d@@ ating his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another field . of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had some tem@@ pt@@ ation .

i did n't want to work for an hour at the beginning , but after i did it for a few months i felt better than i would be better than i would be on the evening of september 5 , north korea .
after gradu@@ ating from college graduate , the job he found was not as good as expected . finally , he hung up his name at a guesthouse and used the pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am very satisfied with the current work , and the environment is good , i want to do more hours of work .
it is understood that h@@ our@@ ly work has become an accumul@@ ation of experience for some graduates who are working on job - seeking , but over@@ l@@ apping work skills , communication skills , and increasing social experience .
when graduates work hours , they focus on jobs that are more knowled@@ ge@@ able and techn@@ ically competent , such as transl@@ ation posts with a strong professional character , performing arts with a strong e@@ po@@ ch - like ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1@@ % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
the demand for some of the jobs is not high , such as food promotion workers , sal@@ o@@ on drivers , etc. , and unemployed personnel can take up jobs immediately after simple training .
the data show that the proportion of h@@ our@@ ly workers in the industry as unemployed reached 3@@ 9@@ ,000 percent , of which the proportion of retail workers was as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , the proportion of cat@@ ering and cat@@ ering was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , and h@@ our@@ ly workers became an important channel for the employment of the unemployed .

beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) china 's defense ministry has recently formally submitted a " report on defense review for four years " to congress , calling china the most likely super@@ power , that could pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is unreasonable accus@@ ation and emb@@ ell@@ ishment of china 's military threat , and it is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense - guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to explain the issue of china 's military strength and the way the report directly mentioned china 's traditional sun@@ sh@@ ine or western style , saying that it was a major and emerging big country , china 's most influential power that was engaged in military competition with the united states , if the united states does not have any counter - control measures , it is very likely that china will develop bad elements and thus break the traditional us military superiority in the us military
yao yun@@ zhu , resear@@ cher of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions . this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the defense strategy report that china is the newly emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's role as a rising strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called ' military threat ' of china .
major general peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that after the formal sub@@ mission of the " four - year defense review report , " us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , including the defense budget , which amounts to $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if , plus , to add to the budget added to the military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break the $ 500 - billion mark , setting a new historical record , and tang ku@@ ang - qian said that this is almost the sum and length of military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said that the united states ' tr@@ ick of using the threat of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon that has made enemy ri@@ vals , and its real purpose is to win more defense funds and to gain more profits for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense expenditures are quite limited .
military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in the writing of china 's national defense white paper on many occasions , said : since the 1990 's , with the economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased to some extent , but the proportion of national expenditures in the same period has been on the decline .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense expenditures in the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points .
china 's defense budget for 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , only about one - tenth of the us national budget , and the per capita military expenditure of the us people is only about one - six@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the us military spending , and the per capita military spending of the us military personnel is about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the united states ' territory is r@@ oughly the same as china 's territory , but the difference in military expenditure is so great . who is exactly whose military force exceeds the proper defense needs is self - evident . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military ri@@ vals in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been engaged in any other countries in the past and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relationship between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has decided to form a new cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative yuan , and how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
what new policy hamas will implement will directly affect the relevant policy orientation of the parties concerned in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tting attitude of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , the parties of palestine are stepping up consultations to exchange views on the issue of forming the cabinet , which involves difficulties and sensitive points in the development of the situation in the future .
which family is the prime minister 's job ?
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , some people outside expressed worries that prime minister hamas may have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ al , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this hard signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that is in power , and have threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to pass tax on it to palestine .
but this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to elect an independent person .
according to reports , in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , which gathered in egypt a few days ago , decided to elect independent members , ji@@ ali ab@@ d@@ ul@@ lah k@@ hal@@ al ho@@ d@@ h@@ ad@@ ali , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university , to be the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received the response of the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down the tough color of hamas , and only in this way can the cabinet be successful .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient ruling experience .
palestinian newspaper " al-@@ times " carried an analysis saying that hamas has gathered human strength through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing , and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has ruling experience .
hamas proposed to establish a politically motiv@@ ated partnership with fat@@ ah and jointly establish a national coalition government after the election , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
fat@@ ah 's internal opinion on whether to enter the cabinet is different , one faction stands for participation in the new government , and thus some things are accomplished , while the other side is rej@@ ecting hamas 's invitation , and is willing to do a positive opposition group on the legislative council .
the source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually t@@ ended to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to set up a cabinet that is independent of the opposition party .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technical - type government will also be unable to be regarded as a form of cabinet - building to ligh@@ ten external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative yuan takes office on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course should the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hand of hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude , and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to participate in politics by armed force .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on the 9@@ th that armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed problem in reality includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas was elected the largest political party in the legisl@@ ature through democracy and freedom , which enabled its subordinate armed factions to legi@@ tim@@ ize q@@ ass@@ am brigade by the same means to unify it into the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed to unify all armed forces into an armed force of the palestinian national authority , but has not received widespread response , and has also been criticized by the islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ ad ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , most of whom are from the fat@@ ah camp .
in addition , fat@@ ah also has some armed factions that are lo@@ ose in organization relations , such as the marty@@ r al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ r brig@@ ades , and fat@@ ah eag@@ le , etc.
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police , civil defense , and other organizations , while the new government 's interior ministry is under the control of the new government .
however , the parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further conclusion .

according to statistics in the " report , " by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 trips to the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a to conduct scientific observation on two occasions , using the x@@ il@@ ong no vessels as a carrier on the platform of the north pol@@ e scientific expedi@@ tion on 2 in north pol@@ e , 2 in di@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion , and more than 3,000 people have been inspected in the country so far , and more than 3,000 people have been inspected in person by the members of the north

sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of effort , china 's polar expedi@@ tion has occupied a place in the world 's polar exploration , but compared with other major polar countries , there is still a big gap between china and other countries . we must try to catch up with others and catch up with others .

h@@ d@@ tv becomes mainstream in america
new york , february 12 ( xinhua ) the number of high - resolution television sets ( sun@@ ken ) has been dec@@ lining and the market has been expanding , and the american television media has also stepped up the introduction of relevant high - resolution tv programs .
the american super@@ market super@@ fl@@ uous and be@@ au@@ ty games , which have just been put on a show , have become the he@@ at mat@@ ches for american broadcast industry to welcome the high - definition television era .
according to a report by " financial times " a few days ago , the us congress recently passed a bill , which stipulates that american broadcasting industry must stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on 17 february 200@@ 9 and send only digital signals .
this means that the comprehensive dig@@ iti@@ zation of the broadcast of us television programs has a clear timetable .

this problem has turned for the better this year .
according to the forecast of the us consumer electronics association , the number of digital television sets to be sold in the united states this year will sur@@ pass traditional tv sets , and 8@@ 5.@@ 0 percent of the digital television sets will be high - resolution products .
japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) researchers at the east china sea university in japan have developed a biological man kid@@ ney , which not only has the same function as human kid@@ ney , but also has the function of re@@ taining material elements , and is small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with the study deepening , it is expected to bring a good voice to kid@@ ney patients .
according to a recent report by " ni@@ k@@ ke@@ i industrial news , " the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ney consists mainly of two parts , one part of which is trans@@ mitted anti@@ d@@ le@@ x@@ al waste and water , and the other part is made of the blood re@@ production of the original ur@@ ine , which is made of blood , and the re@@ vers@@ al of the hy@@ dro@@ ch@@ lor@@ ide , which is used to re@@ use blood , including the blood - re@@ di@@ ous , and other
the three people were engaged in the operation of a m@@ ud@@ dy line , a small body of water , and a small body of water from the middle and air .
this type of sk@@ in can cause multiple blood trans@@ fu@@ sion , multiple cont@@ ag@@ ious cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases , and intr@@ icate and analyze the vari@@ able causes of anti@@ body m@@ ys@@ tic anti@@ body , which are di@@ vi@@ ding , and which can also make the body 's necessary w@@ ac@@ i@@ ac@@ tic ac@@ id and mineral sub@@ stances return to blood .
in the past , the human kid@@ ney used to be used to sub@@ stitu@@ te the com@@ pres@@ sor for waste , and it was not completely eliminated , and it did not have the function of re@@ moving the components of am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id into blood .
researchers used she@@ ep to carry out biological trans@@ plant experiments , and the chinese - air sil@@ k c@@ lif@@ f used pi@@ g - based cell in the c@@ lif@@ f .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the human - made kid@@ ney had been able to function .
at present , they are developing and using biological human kid@@ ney cell@@ s for human kid@@ ney and will start clin@@ ical research after veri@@ fying their safety .
china 's power industry still faces severe challenges
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the state power regulatory commission ( s@@ dr@@ c ) said here today that the power safety production in 2005 will continue to face severe challenges despite the overall stable production safety situation .
shi yu@@ bo , vice chairman of the state power supervision and administration commission , made the remarks at the fifth ( enlarg@@ ed ) meeting of the national power safety production committee held here . he said : in 2005 , china 's power safety production was stable as a whole , successfully fulfilled the task of meeting the peak of electricity supply and summer vac@@ ation , actively dealt with natural disasters , basically ensured the safe and stable operation of the power system , significantly reduced accidents in power production equipment and ordinary power networks , and
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation in power supply and demand and the successive in@@ puts of a large number of new power generating units , the production safety of electricity will face new challenges .

state administration of safety supervision : cur@@ bing excessive occurrence of coal mine accidents this year
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) four cases of one accident in a row involving more than 100 people were reported in the past year , causing serious disrup@@ tion to coal mine production and other serious accidents to occur in china , said liu , head of the central task force in china 's safety supervision work .
the reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 july that it is necessary to really curb the frequent occurrence of extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accidents , such as coal mines , and coal mines are the most important tasks .
this year , the state administration of safety supervision and administration of safety will do the following three things well :
he@@ zi continued to fight a tough battle in gas control .
the gas control program will put itself on a prominent position this year , before it can take on a he@@ at .
if the high gas mine does not take a long time before it can start dr@@ ying out , then it will take a cu@@ sh@@ ion and order it to stop production according to law .
he@@ z@@ y continued to fight a battle of rectifying and closing down .
we must make public the 5@@ 2@@ 43 cases which have been made public to the public , and add to the death penalty of one of the more than 700 coal mines reported recently by various localities .
we should regard closing down as routine work and keep closed down those coal mines that do not cause pollution to the environment and do not have safety conditions .
he@@ zi strengthen the basic management of coal mine safety .
it is necessary to immediately correct the practices of using a small number of large state - owned mines to sli@@ de and guide the establishment of a standardized safety management system .
in particular , key state - owned coal mines must not allow over@@ he@@ ating production of over@@ he@@ ating coal .
this year 's production safety control index demands that the number of deaths from various accidents across the country be reduced by 3 percent as compared with last year , and coal mines in this regard go down by 3.@@ 55 percent .
an extra@@ ordin@@ arily serious accident involving more than 10 people at one time must have dropped by 5 percent , with coal mines falling by 7 percent .
these control quotas have been assigned to provincial - level people 's governments , and localities are now implementing them at various levels .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9@@ 86 coal mine accidents were killed in the whole country , a drop of 0.@@ 77 percent from the same period last year .
however , the excep@@ tionally serious accident that killed more than 10 people on one occasion returned to its head , and the number of victims was up 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent year - on - year .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : the incident of sending children may not end .
xinhua news agency , tur@@ in , february 17 , the world 's biggest economic crisis in the world is expected to end in the next few days , the report said
xinhua news agency , gao peng , ying ding
although italy 's repeated orders said that the use of the stimul@@ ant athletes discovered during the tur@@ in winter olympics could be facing a life - saving disaster , judging from various circumstances at present , this situation is not likely to happen in the first d@@ oping scand@@ al at this olympic games , the main play@@ er of the stimul@@ ant group , the russian winter champ@@ ion , the russian sports champ@@ ion , o@@ si@@ v@@ a , the russian police , was involved .
the tur@@ in winter olympics opened on the 16@@ th , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al since the opening ceremony . o@@ . v@@ il@@ le@@ v was un@@ covered and used banned drug cards and c@@ and@@ or@@ es .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that the car@@ v@@ in@@ ov@@ a had been ex@@ clud@@ ed from the winter olympics . she won the silver med@@ al for the winter second women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual contest at this winter olympics .
the international winter mon@@ ument alliance made an appeal on the same day to the two - year ban on the distribution of children .
the i@@ oc has long stipulated that athletes have been found to be using stimul@@ ants at the olympic games , and they will be removed from their quali@@ fication , but they will not be punished by the law .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and those who def@@ y the law are also facing imprisonment of not waiting for three months to three years .
in december of last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to handle the issue of athletes using stimul@@ ant according to italian law during the winter olympics .
through the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , promising that the police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' place . however , the dis@@ missed athletes who are positive in the field will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organ .
according to reports , the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter olympics officials have already sent the k@@ is@@ i@@ ac case to the du@@ ling procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter cam@@ pu@@ s have not yet confirmed the matter .
russian winter 2 team team doctor and@@ y dem@@ i@@ o@@ ts@@ ov revealed at noon on the 17@@ th that lin@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he has been in charge of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years . shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that once the le@@ v@@ a has returned to china , this matter will eventually be left un@@ finished .
shi kang said : the international olympic committee and the italian government have never been engaged in a thorough resolution on the issue of anti - stimul@@ ant at the olympic games , and even the italian procuratorial organ has really interven@@ ed in this matter , and it is hard to say the result is also difficult to say .
according to the previous verdic@@ t on the use of stimul@@ ant by italian athletes , the he@@ avi@@ est punishment on the banned is only two years ' imprisonment cu@@ shi@@ oning period .
therefore , senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re of italy 's and@@ sa news agency said that the possibility of le@@ v@@ a entering prison is very small , and most of it is a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be held in a abs@@ ence trial , italian police could not possibly go abroad to take the plac@@ ard of car@@ l@@ v@@ a and take a sentence .
if the court sent the lev@@ a to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , italy would not have found her to be in a position .
