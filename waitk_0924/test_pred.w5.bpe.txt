chin@@ ane@@ w@@ s@@ .@@ com , july 30 .
according to a report by china securities news , the " provisional procedure on the management of overseas investment of insurance funds " was promulgated a few days ago , and insurance funds have a broader space for the use of the capital market .
the chief investment officer of china 's auto - share company , liu le@@ fei , believes that the rmb 's appreciation and the domestic capital market are improving , and insurance institutions will not invest overseas through foreign currency purchase in the short term . this also impl@@ ies that the domestic stock market funds will not be diverted through overseas investment through foreign exchange purchase .
the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same viewpoint .
experts said that since there is no such market as rmb floating products , the insurance institutions have not enough risk - ev@@ asion measures , and the time for large - scale procurement of foreign exchange is not ri@@ pe yet .
liu le@@ fei said : in the long run , foreign investment in the allocation of assets should occupy a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , given the fact that the rmb has a greater pressure of appreciation , china will mainly use its foreign exchange funds to carry out overseas investment .
the state council will continue to provide financial support to foreign - funded enterprises in the country in the current circumstances .

the administrative departments of taiwan 's upper reaches of the upper reaches of the hot pol@@ e , indicated on the same day that the current performance of judges on the island is not in keeping with what chen shui - bian said , and demanded chen shui - bian to explain his statement .
according to taiwan 's " tro@@ i@@ ka " report , chen shui - bian questi@@ oned the jus@@ tic@@ es or investig@@ ators on 30 june , but due to political factors or election considerations , the impact of involvement or even the campaign activities of the candidates of various parties were attempting to influence the candidates of various parties . he said he hoped that this phenomenon would not exist in taiwan , but it might be very difficult .
in response to chen shui - bian 's doubts , taiwan 's judicial rul@@ ers have not responded to the inquir@@ y by lu hsi@@ ang - sheng , a mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ization , without responding to the fe@@ ed@@ back of the mechan@@ ics .

gao jin@@ zh@@ ig@@ uo pointed out : kaohsiung high - speed court judge zhang sheng@@ xi took part in the high - speed college course several years ago , because the relevant courses have the fla@@ v@@ or of political parties and the self - discipline committee formed by judges .

germany to lower import thre@@ sh@@ old for professional talent
the first meeting of the chinese academy of sciences ( c@@ as ) was held in ber@@ lin on 1 july .
german education minister sh@@ au@@ k@@ at s@@ ay@@ a said the other day that germany should lower the " rules " on lim@@ iting the import of foreign professional talent and , through increasing the introduction of foreign talent , solve the problem of professional talent facing germany by increasing the introduction of foreign talent .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany has reached the age of 15 to 64 years old and will gradually decrease its work@@ force .
if there is no sufficient immigration , by 20@@ 20 germany 's labor force will decrease by 6 % .
however , the german federation of employers and the german association of engine@@ ers reported that in the current labor market , engine@@ ers with professional skill are relatively strong .
according to data from the federal labor bureau , in may of this year , engine@@ ers in the german labor market supply volume was about 17@@ 0,000 , and technicians supply around 9@@ 600 .
in order to protect the employment of its own people , germany has set a relatively high thre@@ sh@@ old for introducing foreign talent .
germany 's " fle@@ xing method " stipulates that professionals from non - eu countries cannot hold lower than 8@@ 5,000 eur@@ os in germany , otherwise they cannot obtain permission for their work and residence in germany .
he suggested that this limit be lowered to the limits of lu@@ ster .
we should not blin@@ dly follow the law .
the draft amendment to the law on lawyers , which has been submitted to the npc standing committee for examination and approval recently , stipulates : those who have engaged in law research and other professional work , and who have high - level personnel or similar professional expertise , who apply for the law to practice their business , shall be approved by the judicial administrative department of the state council and be granted the status of lawyers .
( 28 june " china : china " )
in the law , there are signs of mechan@@ ization and mechan@@ ization , and the first one mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and other such tre@@ mors are engaged in li@@ tig@@ ation legal consultation services , such as legal consultation services , etc.
for a long time , laws have developed and applied laws and rules regarding intellectual affairs exist among the population , while those in the field of knowledge and those in the field of knowledge have failed to exist as mechan@@ ically mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ics and mechan@@ ized pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ al , and mechan@@ ized le@@ ver@@ age of ver@@ aging the theory of mechan@@ ized mechan@@ ics have been critical critical of the theory of the theory of the marxist theory , which
with regard to such differences in division of labor , the law can do it without maintaining a single hand supporting any party .
however , the uph@@ ill illu@@ min@@ ation of the " law of lawyers " obj@@ ectively recognized the laws and rules of the 20th century , which are more objective than laws .
in fact , some experts engaged in legal history and international laws are purely in theoretical research and teaching . their theoretical top@@ ograph@@ ical high points are no longer closely related to legal practice .
thus , the control over the structure of the lic@@ enses of laws has undoubtedly opened a lo@@ ose prospect for the laws that exert an extremely bad influence .
the tendency of super@@ sti@@ tion in the knowledge of the theory is not limited to these , for instance , experts and experts will often influence or even ve@@ to the court 's judg@@ ement , and this is also a direct manif@@ estation of super@@ sti@@ tion .

britain low@@ ers control over terrorist attacks
xinhua news agency , london , july 5 th , by reporter lin guo
the british government has lowered the risk of terrorist attacks from the highest level to the top level , indicating that the next wave of terrorist attacks in britain will not occur , but the attacks will still be extremely likely .
at present , the british police have transferred the investigation scope to india and australia .
the eight terrorists arrested were all under medical system .
it is learned that nearly 20 % of the people working in the british public medical system have obtained medical qualifications overseas .
the prime minister also demanded that the restrictions on migr@@ ation of high - tech knowledge be investigated , and that employers or relevant organizations be requested to provide background information .
do n't let the reta@@ il@@ ers get ti@@ red .
the picture is relax@@ ing .
but in china , many people have encountered such a kind of worry , and in the mid@@ st of these businesses and intermedi@@ ary business , they pursue after and pursue their care@@ ers .
whether it is a car or train , the upper hand will always en@@ counter small reta@@ il@@ ers and some un@@ certified bro@@ kers .
it is not selling pe@@ t@@ ty see@@ ds of bre@@ ast sa@@ pl@@ ings , that is , selling newspapers and peri@@ o@@ dic@@ als , and then introducing many unlicensed intermedi@@ ary agencies to introduce food cat@@ ering , and even false information .
if you do n't accept it , he can ch@@ ase you several hundred meters , and if you are not successful , then you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent .
in some scen@@ ery , many hor@@ ses also have the same feeling .
before entering the gate , some people started sigh@@ ting and sigh@@ ting on small matters .
after entering the door , this situation will be even more , and y@@ ax@@ ing will be bl@@ amed even if the situation is good .
there was media reports that many foreign tourists who went to xian had a very un@@ ending pra@@ ise for xian mon@@ uments , but they were not allowed to do so many times , and they were not comprehen@@ sible to allow the small business haw@@ kers who had much to play up .
these include wind - shap@@ ed wind at stations , this kind of growth momentum , which emerged in certain regions , should be within an orderly , qu@@ iet , and harmonious , and provide a broad environment for the growth of the broad@@ est population .
the free flow of commodities and the distur@@ b@@ ance of the illu@@ sion has obj@@ ectively under@@ min@@ ed these emerging public order , forming a pollution control and environmental pollution structure , and at the same time , provides the conditions and opportunities for the growth of these areas .
what is important is that these concepts are the window and the eye on the whole of china 's spiritual civilization construction , and they are not only im@@ ages but also will have an impact on local economic development .
just imag@@ ine , if you want to become a strong tourism industry , you will use this m@@ ess of tourism to gre@@ et the visitors coming from south to north . who will dare to come ?
your tourism economy will yield results ?
with the arrival of the peak tourism season , the number of tourists from the north and south creating a civilized tourism environment should be said to be a pressing task .
but the bro@@ thers do not have to be market , and small business haw@@ kers should be regul@@ ated and operations without a license should be resolutely canc@@ elled , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
a civilized and orderly environment can allow the young pione@@ ers to get happy and return to their happy course .
in a word , do not let the reta@@ il@@ ers get ti@@ red .
the re@@ wards of the original prop@@ on@@ ent can be deduc@@ ted .
the construction of dong@@ cheng district in beijing has used power generating , et@@ c , as a means to dissemin@@ ate electric sh@@ ell and other products to reward 12 households who volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ treat .
( " xin jing bao " ) 10 july
this writ@@ er has felt happy for the improvement of family life , but he has taken the initiative to keep the word about the word on the one hand , and still has the method of giving equal footing to the other , but has complicated m@@ ood .
jian@@ ji neighbor@@ hood office deputy director said that in light of the problems of low - income tax fraud , and other problems , encourage active withdrawal of minim@@ al assurance is the model that has been provided for other low - income households .
if this model is to encourage other low - income workers to extr@@ icate themselves from the predic@@ ament through their own efforts , it is indeed worth advocating that , if this is used to contain those long - time low - income personnel who want to obtain protection , it is not an n@@ ai@@ ve person .
in terms of differ@@ enti@@ ation and clearing up low - risk households , it is more dependent on the law .
relevant departments should strengthen the protection of low - income families when enjoying the minimum guarantee : timely noti@@ fication of changes in family members and income , report on employment situation , and accept regular re@@ examination , while relevant departments should intensify their supervision and inspection .
after all , only by reg@@ aining control according to law can one survi@@ ve long .
the neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds have re@@ war@@ ded the kun within one month after re@@ taining the demobilized family .
as a level - 1 government organization , the expenditure is borne by fiscal appropri@@ ations .
but the money of the tax@@ pay@@ er should not be spent ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from the low - income families prov@@ es that they have the ability to possess certain self - suffici@@ ency , and on the other hand , are those applying for low - income insurance still not ?
the " al-@@ qa@@ '@@ ida " organization should provide emergency relief to the victims of the disaster , instead of adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that the service provid@@ er would have more intense hat@@ ches .
on 10 july , the first public - run township with a lo@@ oph@@ ole in the mu lan township , which has been directly elected , took up the post for the fourth time , with the rate of satisfaction among the democratic ty@@ mu of the new territories reached 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent .
when the reporter had a dialogue with liu di@@ yi , liu di@@ yi made himself a play@@ er .
( yesterday 's " xin jing bao " )
liu rig@@ i@@ yi 's fla@@ x service may be more flexible than some appointed cadres who have established mechanisms , have established mechanisms , have more real advantages than appointed ones .
compared with the system of direct election , the biggest obstacle lies in the former system of party members deciding the source of power , mainly by the higher level organizations , and the source of power , which determin@@ es that the former must put being responsible to the public in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility for whom are responsible are the fundamental factors determining how the elected person will carry out his work .
some doubt that this kind of democracy is like a hot field of democracy .
my view is that with such a conc@@ isely concep@@ tual mon@@ o@@ grap@@ h , it is better than not .
considering the reality of china 's grassroots democratic political construction , i believe that holding open elections is a major breakthrough . democratic concepts are the basis for internal democracy .

she also devoted herself to social welfare , which is the result of many honor@@ ary presidents of culture and social welfare organizations .

in india , the g@@ and@@ hi family has long been in control of the ruling national congress party .
par@@ ade was welcomed by a large number of female voters , and female voters believe that par@@ ker will break with india 's female mentality that is seriously dis@@ crimin@@ ating against women , and will enhance the female image .
the constitution stipulates that india is a federal state , and the president is the head of state and the ruling party in the name of the president , and does not represent any organization , much more of which is a symb@@ ol .

according to reports by us media on 15 june , the heart disease and other bad re@@ actions caused by the anti - di@@ a@@ bet@@ es drug v@@ anc@@ ou@@ di@@ ya has shown a dram@@ atic up@@ ward trend in the united states recently .
the food and drug administration of the united states issued a security warning in may this year and suggested di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients to be cautious with care because scientists published a new magazine " xin tan " on 21 may , which says that this popular drug will greatly increase the inci@@ d@@ ence and mor@@ tal@@ ity rate of car@@ di@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar diseases of patients .
v@@ end@@ or 's control was affected by the close attention of doctors and patients .
statistics show that after a safety warning is issued , the us pharmaceutical authority has received 3@@ 57 examples of the cases of mal@@ n@@ our@@ ishment , of which 38 were reports of death .
in january and february this year , the pharm@@ acy and pois@@ ons board received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse re@@ actions respectively .
these bad re@@ actions are ligh@@ tly ti@@ ed to bu@@ b@@ ble , weigh@@ ing heavily to sudden heart disease .
however , the drug expert of the us drug administration believes that it is now the conclusion of ben@@ ed@@ ic@@ t 's in@@ security that has come to a hast@@ y conclusion .
the board will hold a meeting on the man@@ dy rules of v@@ end@@ or on july 30 .
in 1999 , the tre@@ ble language di@@ ya was a kind of pan@@ cre@@ as increasing agents , applicable to ther@@ ap@@ y .
around 6 million di@@ a@@ bet@@ es patients have taken or are taking wen@@ di@@ ya .
v@@ end@@ or 's pol@@ ish gr@@ af@@ fi@@ x has always thought that ben@@ di@@ ya is safe and has a long - term interest over patients .

the us defense department re@@ considers reducing us troops in europe
us defense department officials said on 23 march that due to changes in the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is considering again formulating plans to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .
the us media quoted a defense official as saying that since the iraq war is still going on and that relations between the united states , russia , and iran are wor@@ s@@ ening , the defense department has raised doubts about the feasibility of reducing the european garrison plan .
he was appointed secretary of defense rumsfeld at that time , announc@@ ing that the united states would increase the number of troops stationed in europe from the previous 11.@@ 2 in 2001 to 7.@@ cu@@ ts , with the establishment of a new type of army with few fla@@ x .
at present , the total number of us troops stationed in europe has dropped to the preci@@ p@@ itation of the personnel .
however , in june this year , the commander of the us military 's european command ( us@@ d ) submitted a report to the current defense minister on the reduction plan .
the report said that the us troops stationed in europe , while reducing their troops , were also transferred to iraq and afghanistan in turns , causing shortage of us troops in europe and unable to carry out normal cooperation with european allies .
the report suggested that the reduction of us troops stationed in europe be stopped .
relevant us experts believe that the above phenomena show that the long - aw@@ a@@ ited iraqi war has already caused chaos in the original plan of the us military .

today , a certain communications training brigade of the chengdu military region moved out of a dozen or more cadres in the zh@@ an@@ huan - shap@@ ed fields . each of them is good at each of them . they are full of respect and knowledge in the style of dealing with real problems and tough problems in the big team party committee members .
a few years ago , with personnel 's adv@@ ent@@ ure , some of the buildings of this brigade were occupied by violating regulations , making it difficult for the housing of the current cadres and the officers and men to have a lot of complaints about this .

the desig@@ ner of the 07 military uni@@ form is a guest of the chin@@ am@@ il .
beijing , 13 july ( jief@@ ang@@ jun bao ) -- yang bao@@ jin and liu xin@@ xin reports : the pla units will gradually change their military uni@@ forms in 07 style beginning 1 august .
this evening , chin@@ ad@@ ail@@ y@@ .@@ com specially invited military goods and materials needed for hand in hand to hand in hand , tr@@ acked by senior engine@@ er chen jun and senior engine@@ er of the armament research institute of the ne@@ west military equipment research institute to be an guest of the chinese military , and the background and development process of the birth of new military uni@@ forms with ne@@ tiz@@ ens both inside and outside the military have ev@@ o@@ ked an impact among ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the chief desig@@ ner of the 07 - type military uni@@ form design .
on the question of the change in the new military uni@@ form , they said that the military uni@@ form is in the style of + jian - 7 , especially the 97 type military uni@@ form , and the series uni@@ form uni@@ form uni@@ form style improved more than several hundred times .
the biggest difference in military uni@@ form of 07 is that it reflects the characteristics of the qu@@ al@@ itative leap - style character , enabling the uni@@ form of our army to reach the supporting pattern of three services in coordination of the army for the first time , and indicates that the level of construction of military uni@@ form has reached a historic leap .
the two guests also exchanged views on the varie@@ ties of pol@@ ish - fla@@ v@@ or of new military uni@@ forms and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
this expedi@@ tion was jointly launched by the chinese military web site and the information network jointly conducted by china military net and china web site .
the jing@@ jiang city personnel 's platform has improved the quality of military cadres .
the first batch of new year 's college graduates who have grown in the city of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , started their first appearance on 18 june , with lu yu@@ qing , chief of the armed forces of x@@ il@@ ai town , giving a lecture on " winning in inform@@ ati@@ zed warfare " which was delivered by lu qing , minister of the armed forces , received unanim@@ ous approval from the train@@ ees .
this is a new method of thinking that has brought pressure on the military cadres in light of their actual conditions and has exer@@ ted efforts to improve the overall quality of the military cadres .
early this year , the party committee of the pla armed forces department discovered during an investigation and study at the grass - roots level that some military cadres with special arms holding a dominant position and holding concurrently positions have not concentrated their main energy on the work of armed forces .
for this reason , they adopted the method of training in selected areas on a regular basis through training on the basis of experience in training in local party schools , and so on , and made efforts to resolve such problems as single - han@@ de@@ er professional knowledge among military cadres .
in light of the central task , we should boldly hand over military cadres with mission , improve their abilities in post through post - related training .
at the same time , they actively coordinated local organizational departments and jointly formulated the " program for the recruitment of specialized military cadres , " which clearly stipulates that the armed forces minister must enter the leadership group and no longer hold other posts .
and established a mechanism for readjusting and exchanging military cadres , which is un@@ suited to the characteristics of some cadres who are young and who do not adapt themselves to the armed forces work at the grass - roots level in a timely manner , read@@ justed and exchanged in a timely manner , and promoted and used comrades who have a strong comprehensive quality .
not long ago , the chief executive of the new century pol@@ y@@ techn@@ ic company , led the armed forces technical detachment to innovate and develop under@@ water vessels , which were developed by the militi@@ a technical detachment , and were broken into the domestic vessels and were upgraded to the head of the armed forces department of the company .
the best thing is to get good .
judging from the results of the competition alone , 2 - 2 points are reasonable , and they are acceptable , the key is the process of the competition , and the extent of regre@@ ts is much .
if iran 's 2 - 0 lead , then its scor@@ er will equ@@ alize , which will give china the impression that it will be different , and it will have very long morale .
ben@@ evol@@ ence cannot end up , and it can be said that it is a thing of sh@@ ack@@ les .
frequent changes have occurred under conditions of the situation . generally , people do not know china 's views .
this is indeed a process of hor@@ ri@@ fying un@@ equal factors .
however , from today 's competition , it seems that it is not as good as today .
sun ji@@ hai 's hor@@ se -- the wind of the wind of the wind -- which has already started a hor@@ se of the wind -- has not been mentioned by sh@@ ao ji@@ wei and other men in europe . li wei - feng and others are also veteran soldiers who have been living on the s@@ and field for a long time . they see many things in sight and do not have any problems in their psychological quality according to reason .
this hat@@ red was forced by the iranian team to he@@ al up by the iranian team because it was probably a quick move .
iran 's team , in backward conditions , changed two men , immediately got hold of the scenes .
the second half of the field was replaced by three sets of results .
over@@ coming the problem of pre@@ jud@@ ice and being unable to get the end well requires us to accurately find the root cause of the problem .
as long as the problem is accurately identified and the problem is correc@@ ted , it is probably not difficult to find a way to solve the problem .
fe@@ aring that he was in a state of emergency , he would be afraid of going to hospital in a pan@@ ic .
if this goes on , then the hor@@ se will be a game that k@@ ic@@ ked more , and the old problem will still be defeated . it is not possible for everyone to say something to do .
