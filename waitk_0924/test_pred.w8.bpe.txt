the report said that many insurance institutions hold the same view .
experts said that since the renminbi market has not yet been built , the insurance sector has not been able to avoid risks , and the time for large - scale foreign exchange purchase is not ri@@ pe .
liu le@@ fei said that in the long run , in the area of asset allocation , overseas investment should take up a certain proportion in the overall allocation of insurance companies .
however , in view of the greater pressure of renminbi appreciation , china 's + mat@@ ching industry will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds to invest overseas .
foreign - funded enterprises should be cautious in their current situation in investing overseas .

germany to lower professional personnel thre@@ sh@@ old
staff reporter , wang huai@@ cheng , july 1
the german government will continue to support the development of education and research in europe , said s@@ ay@@ man , german minister of education and scientific research , here monday .
according to the o@@ ec@@ d report , germany 's labor force is expected to decline year by year from 15 to 64 .
if there is no sufficient migr@@ ation , then the work@@ force in germany will be reduced by 6 % compared to the present .
however , the german employers ' federation and the german engine@@ ers association have reported that in the german labor market , engine@@ ers are rather competent in professional skills .
the labor department of the federal republic of germany said that the supply of supplies by engine@@ ers in the german labor market was about 1@@ 2,@@ 700 , and technicians were suppl@@ ied with 9@@ ,@@ 600 people .
to protect its own people 's employment , germany has set a higher thre@@ sh@@ old for attracting foreign talent .
germany 's " transit law " stipulates that specialized personnel from non - eu countries cannot wait until germany is equal to 8@@ 5,@@ 500 eur@@ os , otherwise they cannot obtain employment and residence permits .
sha@@ h@@ wan suggested that this quota be lowered to vo@@ ke the euro .
do not super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ously abide by laws and scri@@ p@@ ts theoretical research
the " law on solic@@ itors " submitted to the npc standing committee for deliberation recently stipulates article 8 of the revised draft : those who have engaged in teaching in law and other professional work , such as teaching in law , and those who have high or similar professional standards , applied for the practice of solic@@ itors , are allowed to work in the profession with the approval of the judicial administration department of the state council .
( china : october 28 )
in the law , there are many theoretical circles and academic circles , and the former mainly includes legal teaching and research work , and the latter is more engaged in law@@ suits and consul@@ ting legal departments , and specifically acts of legal action .
for a long time , the legal , theoretical , and scientific and cultural circles have been negl@@ ig@@ ent , and theoretical circles believe that there is a need for the need for a mechanical state , and that it is only a mechanical country , and that it is a theoretical circle that critici@@ zes the academic community and that the theory is not the guiding theory .
the law can do what it can to maintain the ton@@ gue rather than support the existence of any other party .
however , the legal + law of lawyers , which is made of legal entities , obj@@ ectively recognized the law , and therefore , it was higher than the law 's -- the law 's judgment .
in fact , some simply ground@@ less theoretical research and teaching experts and scholars engaged in international law on legal system and international law , and their theoretical research is also linked with the actual law .
in this way , the so@@ dium of lawyers is undoubtedly a legal system , and it has given an extremely bad impression on the society .
super@@ sti@@ ti@@ ous ideas in the theoretical circle are not only these , for example , experts ' argu@@ m@@ entation will often affect or even rej@@ ect the court verdic@@ t , and this is the direct manif@@ estation of this kind of super@@ sti@@ tion .

at present , the british police are shif@@ ting the investigation scope to india and australia .
because of the eight suspects arrested , all of them are working in the medical system , the government will conduct emergency examination of the background of migr@@ ants who have entered the medical system .
it is reported that some so@@ e@@ ks working in the british public health system are all in the country receiving medical qualifications overseas .

the image of tourism is to relax and shu@@ t down , enjoy natural oce@@ ans and social civilization to the greatest extent .
but many people travel@@ ed in china , all suffered this kind of worry , and were shu@@ t down by commercial deal@@ ers and engaged in intermedi@@ ary business .
whether it is cars , tr@@ ains , or vehicles , they always have to face the death of a small business@@ man and some non - license intermedi@@ aries .
instead of selling so@@ dium spr@@ ay c@@ akes , selling newspapers and magaz@@ ines , and then introducing food in large numbers , and even putting on false certificates .
if you do not accept it , he can ch@@ ase you for several hundred meters , and it is most likely that you will become ben@@ evol@@ ent if you do not succeed .
many things like wind , se@@ ed@@ l@@ ings , and even others .
without entering the gate , people come to pay for tourism and make things happen .
after entering the door , this situation will be more serious , and no matter how good it is , it is still so inter@@ esting that it is too co@@ ol to say .
according to media reports , many foreign tourists to xian have an un@@ ending af@@ firm@@ ation of xian 's land , but they have been given more pe@@ t@@ ty businessmen and haw@@ kers who have to p@@ ile up to p@@ ile up to sell .
these include station cer@@ e@@ br@@ al wind , so@@ dium , and land , and should be civilized , orderly , qu@@ iet , and harmonious , and give a broad and broad environment .
the freedom of the traders , the so@@ oner , the lack of confidence , obj@@ ectively destroyed these public order , and formed a system of pollution and environmental pollution . meanwhile , it provided land and conditions and opportunities for land use .
the important thing is that these are the window for the building of the spiritual civilization in the loc@@ ality , and the entire le@@ op@@ ard is damaged not only by the issue of image , but also will have an impact on the local economic development .
let 's imag@@ ine how you should be a big and strong tourist industry , but you should use this m@@ ess of tourism to gre@@ et the guests coming from the south to the north . who would dare come ?
how do you achieve the benefits of your tourism economy ?
with the arrival of the peak season for tourism , a civilized tourist environment should be created for tourists from the north and south of the country . this should be said to be a pressing task at present .
they are not the market , and the pe@@ t@@ ty haw@@ kers ' business behavior should be standardized , and operations without a license must be resolutely abol@@ ished , and illegal activities should be resolutely cracked down .
only in a civilized and orderly environment can we make our jo@@ y , go back to our country , and flour@@ ish .
let the traders wait ti@@ ll you are so ti@@ reless .
and re@@ par@@ ations on their own accord and awards on their merits .
grass - roots houses in dong@@ cheng city of beijing were provided with electricity and other materials as incen@@ tives for 12 households to volun@@ t@@ arily re@@ fund their houses .
( " xin jing bao " july 10 )
i feel happy about the improvement in the living conditions of these families , but we still have some incen@@ tives for giving away the scri@@ pt on our own , and have some incen@@ tives to reward others .
ji@@ ao street office deputy director said that , in view of such problems as sc@@ olding low insurance , encouraging the government to take the initiative to re@@ fund the insurance was an example set for other low - income households .
if we are to encourage other low - income people to extr@@ icate themselves from their predic@@ ament through their own efforts , we should call on those who have long been trying to obtain protection through che@@ ating , but we should not help but be some chil@@ dish .
in the process of making distinc@@ tions and clearing away the soil on which low - income households are protected , it is the law that reli@@ es more on .
the departments concerned should strengthen the awareness of the duty to protect the minimum livelihood of the in@@ sured , and should promptly report on the changes in household personnel and income , report on the employment situation , and accept peri@@ od@@ ic re@@ examination , while the departments concerned should intensify supervision and inspection .
after all , only when we give back orders in accordance with the law will it be a long - term plan .
the streets have given awards to re@@ fund families , who will be bur@@ ied ?
as a first - level government organization , the street is to be borne by financial funds .
and the tax@@ pay@@ er 's money should not be used for any kind ?
on the one hand , the withdrawal from low - income families prov@@ es that they have certain autonomy and ability , and on the other hand , do n't they still have the ability to apply for low - income subsidies ?
the government 's financial appropri@@ ations , which are called money for the relief of life , should provide timely aid in s@@ now@@ y weather instead of adding flowers to the br@@ oc@@ ade .
liu said that he was willing to serve as a service provid@@ er .
on 10 july , the first county head in the country was selected by the public , liu shu@@ tian , from xin@@ du , accepted the fourth time in democracy , with a satisfaction rate reaching 9@@ 7.@@ 7 percent after he took office .

the most important task in the system of direct elections is to make the former mainly decisions on the source of power by ordinary party members , and the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , and the direction of the source of power determin@@ es that the former must put the people in the first place .
the source of power and the responsibility to whom the elected person is responsible are the fundamental factors that determine how the person will carry out his work .
some people doubt that such democracy is like a mon@@ ument of democracy .
my view is that with such a democratic form , it is better to have it .
in consideration of the history and current situation of building grass - roots democratic politics in china , i believe that public and direct elections have already become an important breakthrough , and democracy is an important component of this breakthrough , and we should not under@@ estimate the promotion of grassroots democratic politics .

us defense department re@@ considers reduction of us forces in europe
a us defense department official said on 23 march that due to the iraq war and the world situation , the us defense department is considering a plan to reduce the number of us troops stationed in europe by about half .
the us media quoted a defense department official as saying that since the iraq war is still going on and the relations between the united states and russia and iran are deterior@@ ating , the defense ministry has raised questions about the feasibility of reducing the european military presence program .
at that time , rumsfeld was appointed defense secretary , and announced that the united states would increase the number of troops stationed in europe from the original 11.@@ 5 to 7.@@ 00 , so as to build a new force with a high concentr@@ ation .
at present , the total strength of us troops in europe has been reduced to mat@@ ching people .
however , in june this year , commander of the us military 's european command , james mul@@ cr@@ oft , submitted a report to the current defense minister , asking questions about the reduction plan .
the report says that while cutting troops in europe , many troops stationed in europe have been transferred to iraq and afghanistan in turns , causing shortage of us troops in europe and un@@ normal cooperation between us allies in europe .
the report sugg@@ ests that the plan to reduce us troops in europe should be stopped .
relevant us experts believe that the above phenomenon shows that the iraq war has dr@@ ag@@ ged on for a long time , and the original plan for the adjustment of the us military has been un@@ checked .
china 's national defense minister said here tuesday that china will continue to strengthen its military cooperation with the united states .

the three functions of modern military uni@@ forms
first , recognition functions .
different national armed forces , different branches of the armed forces , and the people 's army are the important symb@@ ols .
in more than 100 countries and regions in the world , although the use of uni@@ forms is basically the same , there is no uni@@ form of the armed forces of any two countries .
second , symbol@@ ic functions .
to a certain extent , uni@@ form is a country 's spiritual outlook and ethnic characteristic , and it is also a country 's military field , a concentrated emb@@ odi@@ ment of its combat capability .
in the uni@@ form of cour@@ t@@ es@@ y , the three military uni@@ forms are most capable of showing the military 's prestige , including the national pol@@ e and uni@@ form .

qiao qing@@ chen said : since the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and banglad@@ esh , bilateral relations have been developing smoothly , high - level exchanges have been frequent , and friendly exchanges and cooperation in various fields have been constantly strengthened .
the two countries have always maintained close cooperation in international affairs and in their respective national construction , and have supported each other in close coordination .
china appreciates and thanks banglad@@ esh for its support to china on issues such as taiwan 's human rights and tibet .
qiao qing@@ chen said that the chinese armed forces value the friendly relations with the banglad@@ esh armed forces and hope to further expand the scope and level of friendly cooperation between the two armed forces and strengthen the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the air forces of the two countries so as to raise the already established friendly and cooperative relations between the two armed forces to a new level .

the 7 - style military uni@@ form design@@ ers invited the chinese internet .
the pla reporter , yang bao@@ jin , liu xin@@ xin , reported that the pla 's units will be changing their 07 - style military uni@@ form from 1 august .
tonight , the chinese military network specially invited military materials to be confisc@@ ated by chen jun , deputy director of the military equipment bureau , and cao sheng@@ jie , senior engine@@ er of the military equipment research institute , the archit@@ ect of military uni@@ form , as a guest of the chinese military , and the background and process of the birth of ne@@ tiz@@ ens from within and outside the military . this has aroused the reaction among ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
the two guests are the direct communications of the seven - style military uni@@ form design .
on the changes in the new uni@@ form , they said that the 7 - style military uni@@ form was specifically replaced with 97 - type uni@@ forms , and the military uni@@ form series was designed on the basis of 97 , and the series of super@@ ficial fla@@ v@@ or and others carried out as many as several hundred improvement items .
the most prominent characteristic of the 7 - style military uni@@ form is the seri@@ alization of the system and the quality of the people 's uni@@ form , which has the first line of the standard of coordinating the three armed services and indicating that the level of the building of our army 's uni@@ form has achieved a historic leap .
the two guests also talked about the variety of new military uni@@ forms , the issue of the so@@ dium of the trees , and other issues with ne@@ tiz@@ ens .
this time , the chinese military net and the chinese online , together with the new wave ,
the platform for personnel affairs in jing@@ jiang city has improved the quality of specialized cadres
on the morning of june 18 , zhu ji@@ aying , a techn@@ ic@@ ian of jing@@ jiang city , jiangsu province , was appointed by lu yu@@ qing , head of the armed forces department of xi@@ lai township , on a coun@@ sel@@ ing course on " winning a psychological war under the condition of informatization " . he was unanimously supported by the train@@ ees .
this is the result of the pressure on specialized cadres in combination with reality , and the efforts made by the ministry to raise the overall quality of special military cadres .
early this year , when conducting investigation and study at the grassroots level , the party committee of the people 's armed forces department discovered that some specialized wu cadres had not devoted their main energ@@ ies to the work of armed forces , because they had appointed their superi@@ ors and concurrently held their posts .
to this end , they have adopted the method of centralized training , and relying on local party schools to train specialized military cadres on a regular basis , and have focused on solving such problems as the un@@ it@@ ary quality of specialized military cadres .
in light of the central work , they boldly handed over tasks to specialized cadres , and improved their abilities to take up posts through training .
at the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly formulated the " plan for the competitive appointment of special armed forces cadres , " which clearly stipulates that ministers of the armed forces must be in the leadership of party committees and not be in other positions ;
a mechanism for the adjustment and exchange of cadres with special arms was established , and the cadres with special skills , who are too old to the grass - roots level , were promptly read@@ justed and exchanged and promoted to the cadres with high overall quality and ability .
not long ago , chen y@@ is@@ ong , director of the armed forces department of the new century limited , led the militi@@ a technology element in innov@@ ating and developing under@@ water vessels to fill the gap in china and to be upgraded to the director of the armed forces department of the company .
good start means good end
from the outcome of the competition alone , the score is reasonable and too much accepted .
if iran leads the team 2 - 0 , then the score will be equal , then it will be different for china to top@@ ple , and it will be very long , and the situation is quite different .
good will come to the end , and one can say that it is a problem .
+ it often happens that under the situation of the situation , people think that china 's psychological quality is not perfect .
this is indeed a lack of confidence , but not a good thing .
however , looking at today 's competition , it seems that it 's not all right .
sun ji@@ hai , sun yu@@ xiang , zhu shu@@ qin , and others who played ball in europe did not say that li wei - feng and others were also old s@@ and - l@@ it players who had seen a broad understanding and said that there would not be any problem with mental quality .
this vo@@ ci@@ fer@@ ous act was forced by the iranian team , which probably was sent to the united states .
the iranian team won the champion@@ ship in a backward situation , and the match was immediately shu@@ t .
and three of them were replaced in the second half , but the effect was not good .
we must overcome the problem that good things cannot come to an end and accurately find the root cause of the problems .
if problems are accurately identified , it is probably not difficult to find the problems .
they are afraid of being hosp@@ ital@@ ized and being sent to the hospital without delay .
if it goes on like this , so@@ aking is a bit more competition , old problems will still be off@@ ended , and no further k@@ ick that people expect will be discussed .
