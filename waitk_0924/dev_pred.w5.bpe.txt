according to a report by zhong@@ guo qing@@ n@@ ian bao , graduates and part - time personnel from institutions of higher learning are the main components of the team of hours ' and engineering personnel .

and to satisfy individual interests and expand one 's knowledge , and this is also a major reason why part - time workers are favor@@ ed by one .
for example , when a certain enterprise is a manager of the human resources department , mr. gu will take a few hours a week to handle the financial account of a foreign company 's representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the maximum benefits for a part - time job were to continuously update his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another area , of course , the income of $ 2,000 per month also has a certain degree of attr@@ acti@@ veness .
as some of the jobs are at a low level , the forms of work are flexible and free , and many graduates are now seeking jobs , 14 % of them are in the tertiary and secondary vocational schools in the past three years .
at the beginning i did n't want to do an hour work , but after i did it for a few months , i felt it would be better than the 9 - 5 night work .
after gradu@@ ating from the university , the work they found was not as good as what they were . in the end , they hung their name at a guesthouse , playing music with pi@@ an@@ o .
but i am quite satisfied with the current work , and the environment is good for 100 yuan per hour , and i am now looking for a few more hours of work .
it is understood that the hours - long work has become a process of accumul@@ ating work experience among graduates who are seeking jobs and accumul@@ ating work experience , improving communication skills , and increasing social experience .
when graduates do hour - long jobs , they focus on the areas with a relatively strong knowledge and skills , such as transl@@ ation jobs with a strong professional prof@@ ic@@ i@@ ency , time - specific performing arts , with a strong ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
hours work and part of work skills are not required to be high , such as food sales promotion personnel and driving sli@@ ps , etc. the unemployed personnel can take up jobs through simple training .
the number of hours ' employees was originally a small percentage of the unemployed . among them , the number of unemployed personnel in the retail trade reached 6@@ 8.@@ 44 percent , and the percentage of the food and be@@ ver@@ age was 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent . the number of hours of work has become an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

china expert : us pre@@ aches military threat theory in china
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a national defense budget for the year of the year of the defense review , which was officially submitted to congress by the pentagon to the congress a few days ago , saying for the first time that china is the most likely new big country that may challenge the united states .
experts believe that this is a challenge to china 's normal national defense construction , and playing up the illu@@ sion of the chinese military threat is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guiding document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report uses three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound china 's military strength and the way the united states should take , and the report directly men@@ tions 15 times the two major topics of china or mechan@@ ics in china , and says that it is a major and emerging great power that possesses the most potential for military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not adopt anti - control measures , it is very likely that china will develop weapons without conventional counter@@ measure , thus
professor xu bo@@ dong , research fellow of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the strategic defense report that china is the most likely emerging power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia 's dri@@ ft toward china for the first time , especially its so - called " top@@ pling military threat " to the so - called china as a new strategic ri@@ val .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
what is worth noting is that in the " four - year defense review report , " us president bush also submitted a draft plan to congress on the same day , which includes a defense budget of 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if it is added to the plan to carry out military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for 2007 will exceed 500 billion us dollars . this will be a new record in history . peng guang@@ qian said that this move is almost all the other countries ' military spending . this is almost the same as all the military spending of the other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the conspiracy of the theory of the mechan@@ ics of other countries , which origin@@ ated in the united states , reflects the consistent style of the pentagon which has created the enemy 's prop@@ ell@@ ant , with the real purpose of gaining more defense spending and gaining more profits for the huge arms industrial group of the united states .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white papers many times , and said that since the 1990 's , with the development of the economy , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure has on the whole declined .
official data show that the number of chinese national defense expenditures in 2004 and 1979 accounted for a decrease of nearly 10 percentage points over the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense expenditure was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only about one - fourth of the united states ' total national military expenditure , which is equivalent to the united states ' per capita military expenditure , and the per capita military spending of the military is about one - thir@@ ty of the us military .
the size of the us territory is r@@ oughly equal to china 's territory , but the gap between military spending and military spending is so huge . who exactly exceeds the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction situation , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have a single word in the past or at present , and will not pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has over 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in the asian region alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas ass@@ ails cabinet for breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming a cabinet
xinhua news agency , wang ha@@ o@@ huang ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative elections , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas implement directly affect the interests of the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , various palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming a cabinet that will involve future development .
premier position spent on wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever family
hamas has been elected to the cabinet , and some people outside are worried that hamas might have a dispute with the current top leader , ab@@ b@@ as .
in addition , hamas leaders who are currently visiting egypt stressed that the hamas - led new palestinian government will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also intensified international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government with real power and have threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and selecting an independent is a de@@ tr@@ im@@ ental policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , hamas leaders at home and abroad , who have gathered in egypt , decided to select an independent person@@ ality jam@@ el jam@@ a@@ wan ho@@ d@@ or@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the gaza islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter how many people took up the post of prime minister , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister should try to dil@@ ute hamas candidates in hard - line color , only in this way can it guarantee the success of the cabinet .
power , distribution of power
in the internal context , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily published an analysis saying that hamas 's use of social welfare projects has ass@@ em@@ bled people , but it lacks experience in governance and is closely linked with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the ruling experience .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partn@@ er@@ ships with fat@@ ah , and jointly establishing a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , whether fat@@ ah will be elected to the cabinet is different , and the faction advocating joining the new government and doing something to be accomplished , and the other faction rej@@ ects hamas ' invitation and is willing to actively engage in the opposition within the legislative council .
the informed source pointed out that after ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually t@@ ended to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to form a legislative committee , which is divor@@ ced from the party 's sovereignty .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean - up government , but the specific list of the cabinet is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technical expert - type government is also not in a way to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet three to five weeks after the inauguration of the new cabinet on 16 february .
armed forces go on track
the weapons in hamas are the other major thor@@ ny issue facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect it in political affairs .
hamas leader ma@@ ch@@ ar stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is the option of the organization 's strategy .
the armed issue actually includes the legi@@ tim@@ acy of weapons and the control of the armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , was elected the first largest party in the legisl@@ ature , and has been recognized by the international community , enabling its subordinate armed factions to legi@@ tim@@ ize the tam@@ il tig@@ er to the government security organization .
hamas once proposed to unite various factions and factions into the palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a broad response and was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( je@@ h@@ ad@@ ur ) .
palestine currently has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the great majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose organizational relations with some armed factions , such as the cha@@ e marty@@ rs brigade , such as the eag@@ le of the fat@@ ah marty@@ rs , etc.
hamas , in charge of forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that are all their own government , and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil def@@ ence , and other organizations , and the interior ministry of the new government is under control .
however , all sides are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

japanese researchers develop new highly - efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the japanese university of east china sea research personnel developed a biological - man kid@@ ney - making method which is similar to human kid@@ ney - making function , and also has the function of keeping sub@@ stitu@@ te sub@@ stances , which is small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with the study , it is expected to bring a good news to patients with kid@@ ney disease .
according to the latest report by ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai shim@@ b@@ un , the newly developed biological man@@ made kid@@ ney consists of two parts , with some being fil@@ tered in blood for xie wast@@ es and water di@@ pped in water . a portion of the population formed a kid@@ ney - shap@@ ed structure from the original ur@@ ine water di@@ agn@@ os@@ es and the kid@@ ney ac@@ id , etc. , is used to return to the blood tu@@ bes and the blood tu@@ bes again .
the court has built a human body in a small area , which is composed of the inside story line , the water inside the water , and the inside control of the inside of the water . the inside side of the water pip@@ e has also been filled with the di@@ vi@@ ding ne@@ ts with the functions of xie wast@@ es .
this type of sk@@ in cell@@ s can make many blood trans@@ fu@@ sion diseases cause by multiple blood , and analyze the inter@@ related source ar@@ id causes of the trans@@ form@@ ative theory of material trans@@ form@@ ations into hydr@@ og@@ en kid@@ a and return to the blood , and at the same time can enable the gl@@ uc@@ ose from the gl@@ uc@@ ose that is essential for the body to enter the blood again .
the previous man@@ ual kid@@ ney reli@@ ed on the differ@@ ential of se@@ epage pressure to fil@@ ter xie waste , and it cannot be completely removed and is not equipped with the conditions for the re@@ entry of the hydr@@ oc@@ ar@@ b@@ ic ac@@ id and other elements into the blood .
researchers use the she@@ ep to conduct bi@@ of@@ il@@ ters for kid@@ ney trans@@ pl@@ ant@@ ation experiments and the use of p@@ ig@@ s in the chinese - h@@ aired sil@@ k line for man@@ made kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that man@@ ual kid@@ ney has been able to play its functions .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive commissi@@ oning of a large number of newly built generating units , the safety of power production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seas@@ onal vac@@ ation conditions , and power shortage will still exist , and the situation of power supply and demand in some regions will remain tight , and because the mechanism for coal prices has not yet taken shape , there are still quite a big problem in power supply , and at the same time the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , and the weak power gr@@ id structure , out@@
shi yu@@ bo said : with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the ranks of workers and ensure the normal order of production will become a new problem facing us .

south african envoy to china says south africa does not have any organization in the area of crime , which is targeted at chinese citizens
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a working group to provide medical and health care for the south african people , said minister of foreign affairs and trade of g@@ am con@@ ang , who is a representative of the south african embassy in china , in an exclusive interview with xinhua news agency .
he also said that the south african government will spare no effort to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu k@@ on@@ in said the south african government hopes to reduce the ratio of crime to zero and hope that each foreign person working in south africa will be given the local law and the citizens ' full protection .
since 2006 , four senior chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed a wide range of concern for this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side in this regard and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and precau@@ tions . the overseas chinese have strengthened unity and friendship and cooper@@ ated with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we set a minimum of five times for the victims ' families .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are very sor@@ ry over this , and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is conscientiously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case of chen jian@@ qing , a chinese fujian woman , who was killed in south africa on 5 february . a suspect has been arrested .
police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the hong kong police have arrested a criminal suspected of shooting hong kong business@@ people in january this year and the victim 's property has been recovered .
when talking about the possible consequences of the killing of chinese citizens , fu k@@ ang@@ ning believes that these incidents will indeed produce a negative impact on trade and tourism between the two countries and on other areas , but in the long run , the impact should not be changed from a large angle in the long run .
the south african embassy tourism commissioner , n@@ el@@ i , said that the embassy had provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists in the first 15 days of this year alone .
according to official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its status as the largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 - billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the successive killing of chinese citizens in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism board , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 3@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9 percent compared with the same period last year .
at present , there are 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the urban and rural areas in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , the un@@ checked flow of guns , and the abs@@ ence of a deterr@@ ent to death penalty have resulted in the high crime rate .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash with their bodies and families , and they are more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal elements who seek financial attacks .

shi kang said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have been holding a series of meetings on the issue of anti - d@@ oping agents in the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in the matter , it is still hard to say .
in the past , italy used the stimul@@ ant incident to judge the penalty of the italian athletes , and the most severe punishment given by the banned is only two years of suspended prison period .
therefore , senior reporter of italy 's ant@@ a news agency , p@@ el@@ i , said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a into pris@@ ons almost seems to have a mic@@ ros@@ oft , and that at top it is fine .
