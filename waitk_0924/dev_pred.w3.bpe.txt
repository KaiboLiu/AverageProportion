the report , which has a total of 92 p@@ ages , expounded in three chap@@ ters on the question of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should take , in a total of 15 times , directly mentioned two terms in the sino - us relations , which were cl@@ oned over between china and france or between china , saying that it is a major and emerging power , that china has the greatest potential to conduct military competition with the united states , and that china may develop its military superiority in
the world military science research institute of the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yun@@ zhu , said : although senior us military officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions , this is the first time that the us defense strategy report has put forward in the defense strategy report that china is the emerging power which may most challenge the united states military .
this year 's report clearly will for the first time link russia 's accession to the world trade organization , india 's emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china military threat theory , to pay more attention to the men@@ ace .
the chinese military is a strategic partner of china .
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense review report " submitted , the united states president bush also briefed congress on the fiscal year 2007 .
if you add this to the fact that the military operations in iraq and afghanistan are to be added , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , a new historical high , qu guang@@ qian said , " this is almost the same as that of other countries in the world , " said k@@ ai@@ fu .
peng guang@@ qian said : the american specul@@ ation that bes@@ i@@ eg@@ ed other countries ' threat reflects the consistent style of the pentagon fabr@@ icating enemies in je@@ wel@@ ry , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to make more profits for the us arms industrial group .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has been involved in the writing of china 's national defense white paper many times , deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a decline .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the number of chinese national defense expenditures accounted for over 20 percent of the state 's fiscal expenditures in the same period .
china 's national defense budget for 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only equivalent to about one - third of the us national defense budget , and the per capita military spending was only about one - six@@ ti@@ e@@ th of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of military personnel was about one - thir@@ ds of that of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly equal , but its military spending is so huge , and who in the end is the military force that exceeds the legitimate defense needs . this goes without saying .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not im@@ ply that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily in the future .
the 2004 edition of china 's national defense says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never experienced any tu@@ mul@@ tu@@ ous changes in the past and in the future .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries .
professor huang ji@@ as@@ hu of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century in order to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

china , hamas to form cabinet to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency reporter wang ha@@ o@@ huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a new government blueprint has become the focus of international attention .
hamas will pursue what kind of new policy will directly affect the peace process the parties concerned will have their own policy orientation in the next step .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficult and sensitive points in forming a cabinet which will affect future development .
the chinese premier 's position has come to a certain family
hamas won the ruling of forming a cabinet , some people in the outside world worried that prime minister hamas might have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
and is in egypt .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed not to accept a hamas government which has real power , and thus threatened to suspend economic aid for palestine and handed over tax to palestine .
however , this does not ham@@ per hamas ' flexible strategic adjustment , the election of an independent person is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , hamas , domestic and foreign leaders who gathered in egypt recently , decided to elect an independent hamas member , q@@ al@@ e@@ h@@ ar al-@@ na@@ j@@ ah , chairman of the governing board of the islamic college .
this move has not yet received the response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , hos@@ se@@ in , said that regardless of the place where the premier vac@@ ates , the most important thing is that the candidate for prime minister should as much as possible less@@ en hamas 's tough color , and only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed .
the chinese government and people have always paid close attention to the issue of how to distribu@@ te power .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governing .
the palestinian newspaper " daily " analy@@ zes that hamas has been trying to get together people with social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governing and has close ties with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has gained experience in ruling palestine .
hamas has proposed a new security alliance with fat@@ ah after the election , and has worked together with fat@@ ah to establish a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
fat@@ ah is currently in a state of opinion on whether to join the cabinet . the one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus getting something done , and the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas to act as a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ ans toward joining the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah also will hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative committee framework , which is separated from the party .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but it is not known what the specific name list is .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also not to be formed as a way to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form the cabinet after the new legislative council takes office on 16 june .
the chinese armed forces are now in a state of mind .
the weapons in hamas are to form a new government , and the new government is facing another thor@@ ny problem .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough stance and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and refuse to use their guns to participate in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a bin@@ ding strategic choice of the organization .
armed issues actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of armed forces .
hamas has been fighting for the palestinian people by means of democracy and freedom .
hamas has proposed to send all factions into a palestinian national authority , and the people can hardly meet the need of the palestinian people . however , it has not received a wide response . it has also been criticized by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( ji@@ had ) .
at present , palestine has 6@@ 0,000 security organizations , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose organizational relations with a number of subordinate armed factions , such as the marty@@ rs sh@@ yan in aq@@ i@@ q brigade , the tie of the fal@@ u@@ si , etc.
the cabinet - forming hamas must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are each running its own government and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to manage security .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations in the new government , and the interior ministry is in charge of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no word has been written .

mr ship@@ man said , " we feel sor@@ ry for this , and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china . "
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the case of the murder of chen jian@@ qing , chinese fujian woman , in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the south african government and people have been arrested by south african police for suspected shooting and killing of hong kong businessmen in january this year .
on the killing of chinese citizens , jiang said that the chinese government has always attached great importance to these incidents .
according to the south african tourism commissioner , m@@ be@@ e , the embassy has just sent a letter of apology to more than 2,000 chinese people in the first 15 days of this year .
according to the official statistics of china , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner of africa in 2005 .
bilateral trade volume reached 7.@@ 27 billion us dollars , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent from the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism sector believe that the successive 2004 chinese citizens ' murder has seriously h@@ armed the number of tourists travel@@ ing to south africa .

the current south african chinese people have 200,000 people . they are sc@@ attered in the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between rich and poor and the high unemployment rate and the rampant gun - related crimes in south africa are not the main reasons for the high crime rate .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have money to live with their bodies and families , and they are more likely to become targets of criminal elements seeking financial attacks .

international winter season alliance holds first world cup in new york
the international olympic committee has always required athletes to be investigated and used in the olympic games to be dis@@ missed and to be depriv@@ ed of the qualifications for the games , but not to be subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are a criminal act , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes using stimul@@ ants , to def@@ use the law for three months to three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement after a year of hard barg@@ aining . the two sides agreed to handle the issue of using stimul@@ ants by athletes in accordance with italian law during the current winter olympics .
the i@@ oc has made unremitting efforts to promote the development of the olympic games in the four days before the opening of the winter olympics , and has promised that the police will not go to the olympic village to search the athletes ' places . however , the pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary athletes will still accept the investigation of the italian procuratorial organs .

he has been working in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and china 's sports officials have maintained that once le@@ i@@ k@@ ov@@ a is sent back to china , this matter may eventually be ti@@ ed up by the truth .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have held a meeting to discuss the issue of anti - d@@ oping in winter , but they have not solved the problem thoroughly , and even if the italian procuratorial organs really get involved in the matter , it is hard to say .
according to the italian government 's previous practice of using stimul@@ ant agents to italian athletes , the in@@ mates ' most severe punishment is merely a two - year imprisonment with two years ' imprisonment suspended for mit@@ ri .
therefore , the italian lu@@ f@@ th@@ ans@@ a senior journalist , pi@@ er@@ re , said that the lik@@ el@@ ihood of sending le@@ i@@ ka into prison is somewhat di@@ m , and that the most is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court can conduct a def@@ ect trial , italian police could not go abroad to hand over the case to the execution .
if we send the le@@ i@@ k@@ ov@@ a to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take her .
