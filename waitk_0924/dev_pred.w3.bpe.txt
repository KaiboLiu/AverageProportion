sh@@ ao shi , i am quite satisfied with the current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good . what i want to do now is to find several hours of work , and there is still a lack of knowledge .

chinese expert : us pr@@ ay for military threat from china , says nothing
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to implement the " kyoto protocol " in the united states , which was formally submitted to congress a few days ago , saying for the first time that china has for the first time the potential of china being a newly emerging power that may challenge the united states in military affairs .
experts believe that this is a major development of china 's normal national defense construction , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating china 's military threat , and interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new national defense guide document of the pentagon .
the long - term 92 - page report used three expositions on the issue of china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt , and the report directly mentioned 15 times china 's enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ement or the phr@@ ase of china , saying that ci si is a major and newly emerging power , china has the potential of conducting military competition with the united states , and china will very likely develop if the united states does not have any counter@@ measure . this will break the traditional us military superiority and
the world military academy of military sciences research fellow yao yun@@ zhu said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar viewpoints , this is the first time the united states has talked about the issue of china 's accession to the united states in the defense strategy report , which is most likely to pose military challenges to the united states .
the report sh@@ ook off for the first time the strong competi@@ tor from russia , india , and china , especially the so - called china military threat , gave even greater attention to the so - called china military threat .
the chinese academy of military sciences research fellow major general peng guang@@ qian said :
what merits attention is that in the " four - year defense review report , " the same day that us president bush formally submitted to congress the 2007 financial year government budget , including the defense budget of 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if you add to the fact that the war of resistance against iraq and afghanistan is added , the us budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed us $ 500 - billion . it will set a new historical record , bin@@ yin said , because this is almost the same as that of all other countries in the world , and m@@ eng ju , a former minister of defense , said .
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' fabr@@ ication of the fall@@ acies of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's fabr@@ ication of enemies , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds to gain more benefits for the us large arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has been involved in the military experts ' research on china 's national defense white paper on many occasions , saying that since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the state 's fiscal expenditure in the same period has shown a decline .
official data show that in 2004 , the volume of china 's defense spending accounted for over 20 percent of the national financial expenditure for the same period .
china 's national defense budget for 2005 was 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , which is only about one - tenth of the us national defense budget , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about one - six@@ ti@@ e@@ th of the us military , and the per capita military spending of the military is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the united states ' territorial area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly the same , but its military spending is so huge , who in the end who has gone beyond the legitimate defense needs . this is self - evident proof [ name as transliterated ] .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china 's arms control and disarmament association director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become ri@@ vals milit@@ arily .
the " 2004 china 's national defense " white paper says that china firmly takes the road of peaceful development and impl@@ ements a defensive national defense policy .
china used to do not have any good fortune in the future , nor does it threaten any country .
so far , china has not established diplomatic relations with any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries ; and the united states has military bases overseas , and the number of military bases in asia alone has exceeded 100,000 . the united states has already deployed more than 100,000 troops .
professor zhang si@@ yuan , professor of the international relations college of beijing university , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

china 's hamas group to seek breakthrough in cabinet
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 25 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained the victory of the legislative council election , how to draw up the new government blueprint has become the focus of international attention at present .
hamas will pursue what kind of new policy that directly aff@@ ects the next step of the relevant parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficult and sensitive points of forming a cabinet that involve future developments .
the chinese premier post has fl@@ owed down and which family has not yet taken up the post
hamas won the ruling of forming a cabinet , some people in the outside world worried that prime minister hamas might have differences with current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , the egyptian president of hamas , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which is organized by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this strong signal has also intensified international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that is in power with real power , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and handed over tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , elec@@ ting an independent person is a policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas foreign and domestic leaders who gathered in egypt recently decided to elect independent persons from shar@@ m el - she@@ i@@ k@@ h , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of palestine , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received the response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter how the prime minister 's post has come to which home , the most important thing is that the prime minister should do as much as possible to dil@@ ute the hard - line of hamas , and only by so doing can he ensure the success of the cabinet .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to the issue of the " three represents " and has made great efforts to promote the healthy development of the cause of socialism with chinese characteristics .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governing .
the palestinian daily carried an article analyzing that hamas 's use of social welfare projects has caught people 's attention , but in the aspect of governing , it lacks experience and is closely related to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has its governing experience .
in the wake of the election , hamas proposed to establish political relations with fat@@ ah political partner , and jointly establish a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
the fat@@ ah internal affair is now having no opinion on whether to join the cabinet . the one faction advocates participating in the new government , thus getting something done and the other is rej@@ ecting the invitation of the legisl@@ ature , and is willing to make a positive opposition to the hamas .
the informed source pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually le@@ ans toward joining the new government .
even so , the conflict between hamas and fat@@ ah will also be over the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a framework of the legislative committee , which is divor@@ ced from the cabinet of the party .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but it is not known what the specific name list is .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government is also not to be formed into a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new term of the legislative council on 16 june will be held in three weeks and five weeks after the new term of the legislative council is inaug@@ ur@@ ated .
the chinese armed forces are faced with the question of what course to follow in their arms development
the weapons in hamas are to form a new government , which is facing another thor@@ ny problem .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its armed participation in politics .
hamas leader m@@ ash@@ el stressed on 9 june that armed resistance is a major strategic choice of the organization .
armed issues actually include leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of armed forces . " "
hamas has been trying to win the election of the first major party in the legislative council through a democratic and free way , so that q@@ ass@@ am brigade , which is subordinate , is similarly leg@@ alized , is to bring it into the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed to send armed forces to the palestinian national authority , the people , but it has not won a wide response , and it has also been strongly condemned by the islamic ji@@ had ( ji@@ had ) organization .
at present , palestine has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some other organizations that have a sl@@ ack relationship , such as xi@@ an@@ ju 's marty@@ rs brig@@ ades from marty@@ rs sh@@ ao , etc. , for example , from the ag@@ ao marty@@ rs brigade , etc.
the cabinet of ministers in charge of forming the cabinet must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces that each has its own way and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the right to manage security .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence troops , police , civil defense , and other organizations , and the new government 's interior ministry will be in charge of them .
however , the parties are still discussing this sensitive issue , and so far no further has been discussed .

in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee , and won the right to speak and make policy decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 - odd years , china 's polar investigation has never reached its stage , continually developed , and initially built up modern treaties such as the ancient me@@ i@@ ji science research system , namely , the 198@@ 5 - based ant@@ arc@@ tic long town station , which was established in february 198@@ 5 , the southern pol@@ e middle mountain station established in 1989 , the bei@@ polar station established in july 2004 , and the bei@@ ji station that started to perform the task of inspecting
the " report " statistics show that by the end of 2005 , china had already organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific expedi@@ tions , twice conducted inspections of the university of science , using the y@@ iz@@ lan vessel as a p@@ ag@@ od@@ a foundation for p@@ ach@@ el@@ i@@ or@@ a scientific research in bi@@ polar , and more than 3,000 exam@@ in@@ ers nationwide have personally inspected nan@@ qi in person for on - site inspections .
sh@@ ao , we are now making efforts to build the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and is also china 's first inland ant@@ arc@@ tic inland observation station .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar research cause has become a major international investigation center in the world . however , compared with other major polar countries , china still has a relatively large gap . we must keep up with our wo@@ ol and catch up with our ri@@ val .

the state power regulatory commission vice chairman shi yu@@ bo said at the national tel@@ econ@@ ference on power safety ( enlarg@@ ement ) held here that in 2005 , china 's power production safety overall was stable and the power industry completed its tasks of providing electricity to the peak of the summer , thus achieving the goal of ensuring safety of power supply , actively dealing with natural disasters , and ensuring the safe and stable operation of the power system .
however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive operation of a large number of new generating units , the production safety of electric power will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional cooperation , regional conflicts , lack of electricity , and some regional power supply and demand . " the situation of power supply and demand in some regions remains tight , and because the good mechanism of electricity price has not yet taken shape , there are still a fairly large problem in power supply . at the same time , the problem of the drop in power quality has not been effectively controlled , and this will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units . some of the weak
shi yu@@ bo said that with the reform of the power system deepening , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continually be exposed , how to maintain the stability of the employee contingent and ensure normal production order will become a new problem facing us .
in view of the fact that the power production safety work in 2006 is being carried out in a safe manner , shi yu@@ bo said : we should further consolidate the basic work of power production safety , speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency management mechanism for electric power safety , enhance the ability to deal with emer@@ gen@@ cies , strengthen coordination and cooperation with power plants , jointly safeguard the safety of the power plant , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the dam and building an information - based

china 's total consumption of electricity in 2005 reached 24@@ 6@@ 8.@@ 9 billion k@@ wh , up 13.@@ 44 percent over the same period last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand being still on the low side , the contradictions between coal , electricity , oil , and transportation are conspicuous , all power enterprises earnestly took effective measures to strengthen equipment management . last year , there was no major accident in power production throughout the country .
when the power gr@@ id accident occurred 74 times , it was 1@@ 27 less than the previous year , and the equipment accident was 4@@ 27 , decreas@@ ing 13@@ 2 times from the same period last year .

mr ship@@ man said the south african government hoped to reduce the rate of crime to zero and hoped that all south african comrades working in south africa would have better safety in their lives and property . "
since 2006 , the number of people in china has increased by over 40 percent , while the chinese world has expressed its extensive concern about this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , and the overseas chinese to strengthen unity , friendship , and cooperation with the police in jointly cracking down on criminal activities .
sh@@ ao , we express our sincere condol@@ ences and sor@@ row to the family members of the victims .
mr ship@@ man said , " we feel sor@@ ry for this and we also ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is now seriously investigating every case involving china . "

police are now hun@@ ting another suspect for arrest .
according to the south african embassy in china , the two suspects suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen were arrested by south african police in january this year , and the property of the victims has been recovered .
on the killing of chinese citizens , jiang said that the chinese government has always attached great importance to the incident , and will do nothing to help the trade between the two countries , including the tourism industry and other areas . however , from a long - term perspective , the impact should not be big brother than what do you have to do .
according to the statistics of the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy only provided more than 2,000 chinese tourists with a total of 1@@ 2,000 in the first 15 days of this year .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa 's investment in china will continue to grow in 2005 , the largest trade partner of africa .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 8 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the continuous chinese citizens ' mur@@ dering of chinese citizens in 2004 has notic@@ e@@ ably affected the number of chinese tourists going to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists going to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 3@@ 31 , down 14.@@ 9@@ 3 percent from the same period last year .
at present , the chinese living in south africa have about 200,000 people , and the towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa is wide , the unemployment rate is high , and the fire@@ arms are rampant , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death ; therefore , the crime rate remains high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash to their bodies and their homes , and they are more easily targets of criminal elements ' financial attacks .

xinhua news agency reporter , gao peng ding
although italy has repeatedly reiterated that the tur@@ in winter olympics will be held in the city of tur@@ in , and all athletes who use stimul@@ ants may face the m@@ ire of prison , but judging from various situations at present , this is not very likely to happen in the first case of the stimul@@ ant scand@@ al , the main corner of the scand@@ al of the au@@ st@@ in of the russian winter ag@@ ent au@@ st@@ a bi@@ ov@@ a bi@@ ograph@@ ic bi@@ ograph@@ ic bi@@ ograph@@ ic bi@@ ograph@@ ic bi@@ ograph@@
tur@@ in winter olympics will explo@@ de on 16 june for the first time since its opening , o@@ '@@ le@@ of@@ a was found to have used banned drug cards for use .
on the following day , the international olympic committee announced that sending le@@ v was out of the winter olympics . she won the winter games in this winter olympics with 15 kilometers of silver med@@ al in the women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual champion@@ ship .
the international winter season two league also held a series of meetings on the same day to send the dol@@ ph@@ in 's two - year emb@@ argo .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes are being un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and they will be dis@@ missed and depriv@@ ed of their qualifications for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian laws , the where@@ ab@@ outs of the athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the use of stimul@@ ants , and to test the law offenders are also facing a prison of not equal terms between three months and three years .
in december last year , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of hard barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement after a year of hard barg@@ aining . the two sides agreed to deal with the issue of using stimul@@ ant by the athletes in accordance with the italian law during the current winter olympics .
the i@@ oc has made unremitting efforts to promote the development of the country 's olympic culture and the olympic games , and italy has promised that the police will not go to the olympic village to search the athletes ' places during the winter olympics . however , the pro@@ pr@@ ie@@ tary athletes will still accept the investigation of the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ ed the activities of the winter olympics in tur@@ in , per@@ th , and has already sent the stimul@@ ant incident of len@@ in to the du@@ in procuratorial organs .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter themselves have not yet confirmed this .
the russian winter season two te@@ amm@@ ates , an@@ ami , arrived in moscow at noon on 17 august , reve@@ aling that le@@ v had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he has worked hard to create a good environment for chinese sports officials who have worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years . he said that once le@@ i@@ qiang is sent back to china , this matter might eventually be something that has nothing to do with .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the i@@ oc and the italian government have been playing an important role in the issue of anti - xing@@ xing in winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organs really get involved in this matter , it is difficult to say .
according to the previous records of the use of stimul@@ ant by italian athletes , the illegal immigrants have received the he@@ avi@@ est pen@@ alties , but they are merely two years imprisonment and a sentence for imprisonment for years .
therefore , the italian am@@ az@@ a senior reporter , pi@@ er@@ re , said that sending le@@ i@@ ka into prison is very likely to be a little bit arrog@@ ant , and that the top is also a fine .
p@@ el@@ e also said that although the italian court could conduct a def@@ ective trial , the italian police could not go abroad to hand the gi@@ f@@ ts back to prison for sent@@ encing .
if we send the le@@ av@@ ov@@ a to refuse the verdic@@ t , the italian side could not take her .
