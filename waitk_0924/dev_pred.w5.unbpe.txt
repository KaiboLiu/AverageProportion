through the survey of nearly 8,000 hours ' work , over half of the work staff are part - time workers , with 51.111 percent of them .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , and they mainly engage in technical work , such as translation posts , the proportion of part - time staff is as high as 81.7 % , and the number of fitness products is 61.66 % .
high income is the main reason why many people have worked for hours .

mr koo said that the greatest benefit from the part - time job was to constantly update his knowledge and to have opportunities to involve another area . of course , the monthly income of $ 2,000 also has a certain appeal .
as employment threshold for some hours of work is low , the forms of work is flexible and free , and many graduates are gradually getting a favor with job seekers , 14 % of hourly work is graduates from secondary and tertiary institutions in the past three years .
at the beginning i did n't want to do an hour work , but after doing it for a few months , i felt it would be better than the 9 th five - year plan .
after graduating from college student huang , the job found was not as satisfactory as it was . finally , he was hanged at a guesthouse and used piano to play the background of music .
but i am quite satisfied with the current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is good , what i want to do now is to find more hours of work .
it is learned that the hours - long work has become a process in which some graduates have accumulated work experience and have improved communication skills in improving their social experiences through job - seeking work .
when the graduates do hour work , they focus on the relatively strong jobs of knowledge and skills , such as those with a strong degree of specialization , the highly time - oriented performing arts , and the proportion of these graduates is 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively .
hours of work and part of job skills are not high , such as sales promotion of foodstuffs , etc. , unemployed personnel can take up employment after simple training .
the number of hours ' employees was the highest among the unemployed .

china expert : us advocacy of military threat to china is groundless
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a special investigation group to deal with the " four - year defense review report " which the pentagon recently submitted to congress , saying for the first time that china is one of the emerging powers that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a new contribution to china 's normal national defense construction , and play up the illusion of china 's military threat is interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense review report " is a new defense guidance document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three paragraphs to explain the issue of china 's military power and the countermeasures the united states should take . the report directly mentioned 15 occasions the two characteristics of china , namely , the dominating ones of china , or the two branches of china , and said that as one of the major and emerging powers , one has the greatest potential for conducting military competition with the united states ; if china does not adopt anti - control measures , it is very likely that china
the institute of world military studies under the chinese academy of military sciences , yao yunzhu , said that although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints on many occasions before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the national defense strategy report that china is the emerging power that may pose the most possible military challenge to the united states .
the mission of this expedition report clearly defined russia as china 's emerging strategic adversary , especially the so - called " expeditious threat theory " .
peng guangqian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is noteworthy that in the " four - year defense review report , " on the same day , us president bush also submitted to congress the government budget for fiscal 2007 , of which the defense budget for fiscal year 2007 was $ 439.3 - billion .
if the word " god " is added to the military action to be taken in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for fiscal 2007 will break through the $ 500 billion barrier , a new historical high , and peng guangqian said that this is almost the same as the total military expenditure of all other countries in the world .
peng guangqian said : the fabrication of illusions in other countries by the united states that illuminate the illusion of the pentagon has reflected the consistent style of the enemy , which is aimed at gaining more defense funds and gaining more profits for the us munitions industrial groups .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts who have participated in the white paper on china 's national defense , saying that since the 1990 's , as china 's national defense spending has increased , china 's national defense spending has on the whole shown a tendency of decline , as the economy has developed and china 's national defense spending has increased .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's defense spending accounts for more than half of the country 's fiscal expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending for 2005 is 244.656 billion yuan , just about one - quarter of that of the united states , and the per capita military expenditure of the us is only about one - sixty percent of that of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the us military is about one - thirds of that of the us military .
the size of the us territory is roughly equal to that of china , but the difference between military spending and military spending is so huge . who exactly exceeds the proper defense needs ? this is an undeniable fact .
peng guangqian said :
the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , teng jianqun , said that the us side should objectively assess china 's military construction situation , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become military rivals in the future .
the " 2004 white paper on china 's national defense " says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future whatsoever , nor would it constitute a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries , while the united states has as many as 100 military bases overseas , and it has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said that china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , so as to jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas assails cabinet for breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthroughs in forming cabinet
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 25 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council election , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of international attention .
what new policy will hamas implement directly affect the interests of the parties concerned in the peace process in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian parties are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that will involve future developments .
premier posts spend time on which one of the leaders
hamas has been elected as the cabinet since hamas won its cabinet . some people are worried that there may be differences between hamas 's top leader abbas .
in addition , hamas leaders visiting egypt , al-mashal , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel . this strong signal also intensified international anxiety .
the united states and israel have clearly indicated that they will not accept a hamas government that holds real power and thus threatened to halt economic aid to palestine and transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and it is a compromise to select an independent person .
it is reported that in order to obtain the maximum international recognition , hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to select independent personalities jamali [ name as transliterated ] , chairman of the board of directors of the shajiazi islamic university , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who the prime minister 's post has taken place , the most crucial thing is that the candidate of the prime minister should try his best to dilute hamas 's hard - line position , only in this way can it guarantee the success of the cabinet .
power , distribution of power
in the internal context , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian newspaper " the daily " carried an analysis that hamas has gathered people 's morale through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fatah ) , which has the experience of ruling .
hamas proposed a meeting with fatah after the election to establish political partnerships and jointly establish a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded positively to this .
at present , whether fatah will be elected into the cabinet is different , and the faction advocating joining the new government and doing something , and the other faction rejects hamas 's invitation and is willing to actively engage in the legislative council 's opposition .
the informed source pointed out that , with abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually tends to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold talks on the distribution of cabinet posts .
another way is to form a legislative committee framework that separates party - style cabinet from party - style cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the us and israel 's attitude , the technology expert - type government is also not one of the ways to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the palestinian " basic law , " the new legislative council will nominate the prime minister and form a cabinet for three to five weeks after the inauguration of the new cabinet on 16 february .
armed forces go on
the hamas - led weapons are another major challenge facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very tough , and they resolutely demand that hamas abandon violence and refuse to participate in government .
hamas leader al-mahaer stressed on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces issue actually includes the legitimacy of weapons and the control of the armed forces .
hamas , through democracy and freedom , was elected as the first largest party in the legislature , and has been recognized internationally , enabling its subordinate armed factions to legitimize themselves to the same degree of legitimacy .
hamas has proposed to unify various factions into palestinian national authority .
palestine now has 60,000 security personnel , and most of them are from the fatah camp .
moreover , fatah also has some organizational relations loose - seated armed factions , such as the upper guard of the al-aqsa martyrs brigade , such as the hawks of the al-fatah martyrs brigade .
hamas , responsible for forming a cabinet , must consult with abbas on how to manage the armed forces that are in their own hands and distribute security management powers rationally .
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organs , which are under the control of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and no conclusion has been made so far .

however , he pointed out that with the changes in the situation of power supply and demand and the successive commissioning of a large number of new generating units , power safety production will face new challenges .
these challenges include : regional seasonal vacation of power vacation , and power supply and demand in some regions will remain tight ; because of the fact that the coal price mechanism has not yet taken shape , there is still a fairly big problem in power supply , and the problem of the decline in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and this will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units ;
shi yubo said that with the deepening of reform of the power system , many deep - seated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the worker ranks and ensure the normal production order will become new problems facing the party .

south african envoy to china says there is no mechanism in which south africa has organized crimes targeting chinese citizens .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to set up a special administrative region ( sar ) in south africa , the capital of south africa , on tuesday , in an interview with xinhua reporters , said south africa does not have a presence of organizations targeting chinese citizens .
he also said that the south african government will do all it can to crack down on all forms of criminal activities .
fu coning said the south african government hopes to reduce the number of crimes to zero , and hopes that each foreign country working in south africa will receive legal and civil assistance
since 2006 , four senior chinese citizens have been killed in south africa , and the chinese world has expressed its concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and reminded chinese nationals in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security , strengthen unity and friendship between overseas chinese and the police to jointly crack down on criminal activities .
but , we told the victims ' families the most sincere sympathy and mourning .
fu kangning said : we are very sorry about this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating each case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of the murder of chinese fujian woman chen jianqing on 5 february in south africa , and one suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hunting for another suspect .
in addition , the south african embassy in china revealed that the criminal who was suspected of shooting and killing hong kong businessmen in january this year has been arrested by the south african police and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the incident of chinese citizens ' being killed , fu kangning said that these incidents indeed occurred in two countries , and that trade ministers and other areas between the two countries will have a negative impact on trade , tourism , and other areas . looking at the long term , the impact should not be overlooked .

according to chinese official statistics , in 2005 , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trading partner in africa .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.27 billion , up 23.0 percent from the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism industry believe that the series of incidents of chinese citizens ' murder in 2004 have had a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to south africa 's tourism bureau statistics , in the first half of 2005 , there were 20,331 chinese tourists to south africa , a decrease of 14.9 percent compared with the same period last year .
the chinese people now living in south africa are about 200,000 people , and they are scattered in towns and villages in south africa .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor , the high unemployment rate , and the rampant gun flow in south africa have not led to the death penalty , and the crime rate remains high .
since many chinese do not understand english , there are cash on their bodies and at home , and this is more prone to become targets of financial attack by criminals .

( the winter olympics , stimulant ) news analysis : the dispatch of liua is likely to be a matter of course .
duin , february 17 ( xinhua ) the press analysis : the dispatch of liua is likely to be a matter of course
xinhua news agency reporter , gao ying ,
although italy has repeatedly claimed that the winter olympics in turin was uncovered by the use of stimulant athletes , they may face the precipitation of the spiral stimulant . however , judging from various circumstances , this situation is not very likely to occur in the main actor scandal of the first ever hottest eye in the winter olympics , with the staglier series of the stars of russia , which has been the largest ever since the winter games .
the turin winter olympics exploded the first case of stimulant since its opening on 16 june . o ' u leava was uncovered that there were many unbanned drugs .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent leava out of the winter olympics , and she won two gold medals in the winter games in the world 's two events of the women 's 15 kilometers of individual medals for the winter olympics .
world winter quarter league is to be formed in the same day .
the ioc has always stipulated that athletes are being investigated for using stimulant in the olympic games and will be deprived of their qualification for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are criminal acts , and the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate stimulant athletes to defy the law .
last december , the ioc and the italian government , after a year of negotiations , finally reached an agreement on negotiations on a price hike . both sides agreed to handle the issue of how athletes use stimulant in accordance with italian laws during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy has made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pledging that during the winter olympics police would not enter the olympic village to search the athletes ' places of the games . however , drug prosecutors who are exhibited will still be investigated by italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervises the turin winter olympics , executive director peres has sent leava 's stimulant to the dublin prosecutors .
however , the ioc and petersburg have not yet confirmed the matter .
russia 's second winter team doctor andrei mittoov revealed at noon on 17 july that he had sent leavers to dushin and returned to russia .
he has been a member of the chinese sports officials who have worked in the world anti - doping agency for many years , and believes that once the leavers are sent back to china , this matter will eventually be settled without precedent .
shi kang - cheng said : the ioc and the italian government have made a lot of efforts on the issue of the winter olympic games anti - doping agency . even if italian procuratorial organs really involve themselves in the matter , it is hard to say .
according to previous reports on the stimulant events that italy had used to show the banned athletes the greatest punishment was only a monograph with two years of probation period .
therefore , senior reporter of the italian anta news agency , pele , said that the possibility of sending leava into prisons is almost small , and most of the probability is fine .
pierre also said that although the italian court can be tried in a absence , the italian police cannot send leava to the country to take the sentences .
if they send leavers to refuse to accept the verdict , the italian side will have no alternative but to take her .
