hamas to form new cabinet to seek breakthrough .
xinhua news agency , gaza , february 9 , by hamas to seek breakthrough in forming a new cabinet .
xinhua news agency , wang hao , wang <unk> , huang <unk> .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election after the election .
what new policies will hamas adopt to directly affect the relevant parties ' policy orientation in the next step .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added variables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations on the difficulties and sensitive points of the future development of the cabinet .
premier wen jiabao 's position on the issue of the " three represents " is a major step forward in the development of the chinese economy .
after hamas gained the right to form a cabinet , some people worried that hamas prime minister <unk> might have differences with the current top leader abbas .
moreover , hamas leaders who are currently visiting egypt stressed that the new palestinian government that hamas led by hamas would not recognize will not recognize israel 's strong international concern .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that hamas government , which is not accepting real power , has threatened to cut the economic aid and to the palestinian side for the palestinian side .
however , this does not hamper the policy of making flexible adjustments to hamas , and the election is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to maximize international recognition , hamas and leaders of the hamas and home of egypt decided to choose the chairman of the board of directors of the independent school of the independent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that no matter how the prime minister spends the most , the most crucial thing is to lessen the <unk> of hamas 's hard - line position , and only thus can the successful cabinet be guaranteed .
how should power be allocated to the power of power ? .
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing hamas is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
an article in the palestinian " daily newspaper " analyzed the fact that hamas has been collecting popular experience through social welfare programs , but it lacks experience in the administration of the ruling party .
hamas has set up a political partner with fatah after the election , and the establishment of a national coalition government has not been given a positive response .
the internal and external affairs of the cabinet are divided into different factions , and the other faction is to be able to participate in the new government , and the other faction refuses to accept hamas 's invitation .
the informed source pointed out that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah gradually became a new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also hold the bargaining on the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another channel is to establish a framework for the legislative committee to break away from the party 's nature .
it is reported that hamas also designed a <unk> - type government , but it is not known that the specific list is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts of the united states can also be considered a form of forming a cabinet form that reduces external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council nominated prime minister and cabinet members after the new term of office of the legislative council on 16 may .
