xinhua news agency , beijing , wang <unk> , huang min .
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council election .
what kind of new policy will hamas take directly to the parties concerned to take corresponding policies toward the next step of the peace process .
at the same time , the united states and israel 's attitude of boycotting the israeli government have added more variables to the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations on the cabinet , and the difficulties and sensitive points involved in the future development of the cabinet are actively seeking to break through the deadlock .
the premier 's position is to be a new job .
hamas has been able to make a cabinet decision after the cabinet 's power .
moreover , the egyptian government 's leader , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal also aggravated international worries .
the united states and israel have clearly stated that hamas , which is not capable of accepting real power , has threatened to cut off its economic aid and to palestine to transfer its tax revenue to palestine .
however , this does not obstruct hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election is a compromise policy .
it is reported that in order to obtain the greatest international recognition , qi gathered at the hamas home and home leaders ' home of the board of directors of the hamas - led home , <unk> , as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received response from the relevant parties .

the power of power distribution is how to distribute power .

hamas proposed to negotiate with fatah after the election .
the fatah is now divided into different opinions , and it stands for the participation of the new government .
the informed source pointed out that the united states has gradually tended to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fatah will also be able to make bargaining on the allocation of cabinet posts .
in addition , another channel is to establish a framework for the legislative yuan to break away from the political parties ' political parties .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a model of the same type of expert , but the specific list is not known .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical experts of the technology - based government also can be regarded as a form of forming a cabinet that reduces external pressure .
according to the " basic law " of the palestinian " basic law , " the prime minister nominated the prime minister and cabinet members to the post of the prime minister within three weeks .
the armed forces will be able to decide how to follow the path of armed forces .
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem facing the establishment of a new government .
the attitude of the united states and israel is very hard - line , and it is resolutely demanding that hamas abandon its violence and reject the political and government administration .
hamas leader <unk> stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is the <unk> strategic choice of the organization .
