this report has for the first time clearly defined russia 's brand new indian - china strategic ri@@ val , especially the so - called china military threat theory , to the extent that the so - called china military threat theory has attracted more attention .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " report on defense review for the past four years " formally submitted on the same day , us president bush also submitted a report to congress on the budget for the fiscal year 2007 , of which the defense budget was $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
if the p@@ oc@@ ket is added to the military action in iraq and afghanistan , the us fiscal year 2007 will be a year of breakthrough .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us cre@@ ations of the soph@@ is@@ tic@@ ated methods of other countries reflect the consistent style of the pentagon and the like - built enemy , and its true purpose is to strive for more defense spending and to provide a huge us arms industrial group with more profits .
experts said that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he had attended several times the military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in the chinese national defense white paper , said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's defense spending has increased somewhat . however , the proportion of national fiscal expenditure has declined in the same period .
official data show that the proportion of china 's national defense expenditure in the same period in 2004 is about to drop by nearly 10 percentage points compared with 1979 .
in 2005 , china 's defense spending will reach 2@@ 4.@@ 4@@ 66 - billion yuan , only about one - four@@ ths of the united states ' per capita military spending is equivalent to about one - 60 percent of the us military expenditure , and the per capita military spending of the military is approximately one - thir@@ ds of the us military 's military spending .
the area of land of the united states and china 's territory are generally equal , and the difference in military spending is so huge . what exactly is the military strength of the united states going beyond the proper defense needs ? this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the chinese side is willing to work with the us side to promote the healthy development of sino - us military relations , so as to promote the healthy development of sino - us relations , said teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the china arms control and disarmament association .
the " 2004 chinese national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and adop@@ ts a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any good influence in the past and in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent military bases to other countries .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the healthy and stable development of sino - us constructive and cooperative relations in the new century .

hamas to form cabinet to break through
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas has been trying to break through its cabinet
xinhua news agency , wang hao , huang min
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has been defeated after the election of the legislative council . how to draw a new government blueprint has become the focus of attention on the current international situation .
what kind of new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the peace process , and the relevant parties will follow in the next step of their policies .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss issues concerning the future development of the situation and the sensitive points in the formation of the cabinet .
the prime minister 's post has spent the time on which family
hamas has been the only country in the world since it won the cabinet , and people are worried that the current prime minister might have differences with the current supreme leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader , ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ah@@ mad@@ ine@@ j@@ ad , who is visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government led by hamas will not recognize israel , and this tough signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concerns .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has the power to hold , and threatened to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , selecting independent people , and choos@@ ing an independent government .
it is reported that in order to maxim@@ ize international recognition , the hamas ' international and domestic leaders recently gathered in egypt decided to choose an independent person at home and abroad , j@@ ay@@ a islamic university 's board chairman , al-@@ j@@ ay@@ ah al-@@ he@@ d@@ ha@@ h@@ r@@ ud@@ a , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received any response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st h@@ ass@@ an hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who is the prime minister 's post , the most important thing is that the prime minister should try to less@@ en the hard - line color of hamas as much as possible . only in this way can it guarantee the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power ( sub@@ head )
in terms of internal affairs , the greatest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is that it lacks enough governing experience .
the article in the " daily " of palestine says that hamas has gathered in the people 's minds through social welfare projects , but in the aspect of governance it lacks experience and has the ability to unite with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the ruling experience .
hamas proposed a new security concept with fat@@ ah after the election , and jointly formed a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah 's current political situation has not been positive .
within fat@@ ah , there are no different opinions on whether to join the cabinet . one faction advocates participation in the new government , thus making some accompl@@ ishments , while the other faction ref@@ uses to accept hamas 's invitation and wants to do a positive opposition party in the legislative yuan .
according to the source , under ab@@ b@@ as ' advice , fat@@ ah gradually became a new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
another way is to establish a framework for the legislative committee , which is not a party - aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clear - cut expert - type government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the at@@ titu@@ des of the united states and israel , the technology - based government has no choice but to form a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the stipulations of the basic law of palestine , the new legislative council will nom@@ in@@ ate the prime minister and form a cabinet after the inauguration of the new legislative council on 16 march .
where is the armed forces going ?
hamas 's weapons in hand are another major thor@@ ny issue facing the formation of a new government .
the us and israel have taken a very tough stance and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and refuse to join the government with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud al-@@ ass@@ ad emphasized on 9 july that armed resistance is a strategic option of the organization .
armed issues actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the two levels of the bel@@ ong@@ ing of the armed forces .
hamas has been elected as a legislative council 's first party through democratic and free means , and has been recognized by the international community , enabling its subordinate armed forces to keep the leg@@ alization of the man@@ chur@@ ia is to unify their security organs of the government .
hamas has proposed to unify all factions into palestinian national authority , the people 's army , but it has not received a wide response , and it has also been opposed by the islamic ji@@ had ( hamas ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah also has some lo@@ ose organization relations with its subordinate armed forces , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs brig@@ ades , the ar@@ ach@@ i [ a haw@@ k ] , and so on .
hamas , who is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in power and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense and other organizations , and the new government 's ministry of interior will be under control .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further details have been reached .

the " report " points out that in the past 20 - odd years , china 's extreme observation has never been done , and has constantly developed . in the first place , the size of the arch@@ ive has been formed into three stations , one ship of the nan@@ fang ji expedi@@ tion system , namely , the ant@@ arc@@ tic long city station established in february 198@@ 5 , and the ant@@ arc@@ tic zhong@@ shan station established in february 1989 , and the northern pol@@ e station established in july 2004 , 2004 , and
according to the " report , " by the end of 2005 , china had organized 22 research projects in the ant@@ arc@@ tic science , with the name of the so@@ yu@@ et@@ ou river as the northern part of the platform for the arc@@ tic scientific research , which was built on the platform , for two consecutive visits to the huang he station . up to now , more than 3,000 personnel of the national inspection team have visited the south pol@@ e to conduct on - site inspections .
we are now working on the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic station , and is also china 's first inland station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
sun said .
after more than 20 years of effort , china 's polar survey cause has been extremely mon@@ o@@ ton@@ ous in the world 's polar observation , but compared with other major extreme surve@@ ying countries , china still has a relatively large gap .
he said .
sun zh@@ ig@@ hui revealed that china will publish an annual report on its inspection .

the chinese foreign ministry has made representations with south africa in this regard and reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further enhance their awareness of security and to strengthen their unity and friendship and cooperation with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
i would like to express my sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the family members of the victims .
fu k@@ on@@ en said : we feel sor@@ ry about this and also invite the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing killed in south africa on 5 february , and a suspect has been arrested .
police are hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the suspect of shooting in hong kong was arrested by south african police in january this year , and the victim 's property has been recovered .
on the possibility of killing chinese citizens , the chinese government has decided to give a full play to the role of the chinese government in the fight against the japanese government 's invasion of china .
according to the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy has held a public hearing on the incident in the first 15 days of this year , in which more than 2,000 chinese people were issued .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its status as the largest trade partner of china in africa in 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7@@ 2@@ 70 - million , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 7 percent over the same period of last year .
however , the tourism industry believes that the series of incidents of chinese citizens killed in 2004 have caused serious harm to the number of chinese tourists to south africa .
according to south african tourism bureau statistics , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20@@ 31 , a decrease of 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent over the same period of last year .
the chinese living in south africa now have about 200,000 people , and the urban and rural areas in south africa are all covered .
analysts here believe that the gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , the rampant gun , and the lack of a deterr@@ ence against the death tol@@ l , has remained high .
because many chinese do not understand english , there is money in their possession and home , and it is more pr@@ one to become the targets of criminal elements who make money .

if le@@ y@@ v@@ ds refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , italy will not have the way to take her .
