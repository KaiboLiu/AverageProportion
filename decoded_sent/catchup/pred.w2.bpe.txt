chinese experts : the united states advocates that china 's military threat is un@@ justi@@ fied .
xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 , by reporter xu@@ an@@ liang li
experts believe that this is a challenge to china 's normal national defense construction .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is the new defense instruc@@ tor of the pentagon .
the long - term plan of the report , which is in the 92 p@@ ages , exp@@ ounds three sections on the issue of china 's military strength and the us should take , and the report has been directly put on 15 occasions to the china - made - up or the words of " the two , " namely , the words of the two , the words " the re@@ i@@ th , " which are the major and newly emerging big powers , and china has the greatest potential to engage in military competition with
the chinese academy of military sciences , a resear@@ cher with the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar views on many occasions , this is the first time that the united states has proposed that china should be the most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the reason why this report was un@@ equiv@@ oc@@ ally described as a " chinese " for the first time as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the " military threat " of the so - called china , was given more attention .
the chinese academy of military sciences , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense evaluation report , " the united states has officially submitted the report on the defense work for the same day . us president bush also submitted a budget for the 2007 fiscal year of the united states , of which the defense budget has reached $ 4@@ 3.@@ 3 - billion .
if you add to the " security " in iraq and afghanistan ,
peng guang@@ qian said : the us specul@@ ation that other countries have been suffering from the threat of other countries reflects the fact that the pentagon has always tried to create an enemy 's style of making an enemy of the enemy , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds , so as to gain more profits for the large us arms industry .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's national defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times the work of the military experts , including deng hong@@ zhou , who has participated in the national defense white paper , said : in the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of the national financial expenditures in the same period has shown a down@@ ward trend .
official statistics show that in 2004 , the volume of trade between china 's national defense expenditures accounted for 2@@ 3.@@ 4 percent of the total national expenditures for the same period .
in 2005 , china 's national defense budget was $ 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion , and only a considerable portion of the us $ 1 - 14 , while the per - capita military spending was only equivalent to about one - sixth of the united states , and the per - capita military spending of the military is about 1 - 30 of the us military .
they are the largest source of the us territory and the land area of china , and the gap between military spending and the gap is that who is doing so ?
peng guang@@ qian said :
the china arms control and disarmament association director teng wen@@ sheng said that the united states should obj@@ ectively assess china 's military construction and should not allow china to develop and develop its military force .
the " 2004 china international convention on national defense " said that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and pursu@@ es a defensive national defense policy .
china has been in the past and now has not yet started to impose sanctions on any country in the future .
so far , china has not made any progress in establishing military bases in any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries .

xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 , by reporter z@@ ai@@ m@@ ian ( international ) - hamas 's cabinet has found a breakthrough in its cabinet .
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao and huang ju
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has obtained the right to vote after the election of the legislative council .
hamas will be pursuing what new policy will directly affect peace process .
at the same time , the bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the issue of forming a cabinet , which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future development .
the " three represents " are the main theme of the " three represents " and the " three represents " are the " three represents " of the party and government .
hamas won the cabinet .
moreover , the chinese government , which is currently visiting egypt , has stressed that the palestinian government has been formed by the new palestinian government , and that israel , this is a hard - line signal , which has also aggrav@@ ated the international worries .
the united states and israel clearly indicated that they would not accept the hamas , which has a real power , and threatened to dis@@ man@@ tle its economic aid to palestine and to transfer its tax to the palestinians .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t hamas 's decision to make flexible strategies .
it was reported that in order to win the international recognition to the maximum , the meeting of hamas in egypt recently decided to re@@ elect an independent candidate of all the members of the islamic university , j@@ ak@@ ar@@ ta , chairman of the board of directors of the school of education , at home and abroad .
this move has not been approved by the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts , saddam hus@@ se@@ in , said that no matter how much the prime minister 's position is , the most important thing is that the prime minister 's candidate should try his best to weak@@ en the hard - line fla@@ v@@ or of hamas . only in this way can he ensure the success of the cabinet .
the " three stresses " education has been conducted in a timely manner .
from an internal point of view , hamas is facing the biggest challenge .
the " daily news " of palestine analyzed that the united states ' " unilater@@ alist " policy of seeking peace through social welfare projects has not been effectively implemented in the aspect of governing . it is also in line with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has the governing experience , is a top choice .
hamas has been calling for a struggle against fat@@ ah after the election .
fat@@ ah 's internal affairs are still under investigation .
the news brief@@ ly pointed out that under the leadership of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah 's efforts have gradually been incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , hamas 's relations with fat@@ ah have also been going on with the government .
in addition , another way is to form a legislative committee framework to separate itself from the party 's nature .
it was reported that hamas also designed a clear - cut plan to help the government to get rid of the threat of violence .
in view of the fact that the united states and israel have different at@@ titu@@ des and technical experts have failed to provide a good organizational form for easing external pressure .
according to the " basic law " of palestine , on 16 june , the new legislative council , after assuming office , nom@@ inated prime minister and cabinet , will be formed in three weeks to five weeks .
the " three - dimen@@ sional " armed force is not only a matter of course , but also a " road of war . "
the hamas 's weapons are the first to form a new government .
the united states and israel have been very tough and resolutely demanded that hamas give up violence and rej@@ ect its military action .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ mu@@ d al-@@ ass@@ ad stressed on 9 july that armed resistance was the strategic choice of the organization .
armed issues actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the leg@@ ality of the armed forces ' bel@@ ong@@ ing to the management of the two levels .
hamas 's political and economic activities in the form of democracy and freedom have been approved by the international community , and its subordinate armed forces have been k@@ ic@@ ked off by gun@@ men , and the way of leg@@ alizing it is to unify it to the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to include all factions in the constitution of palestine , which is a common task of the people 's armed forces of the palestinian national authority . however , it has not received wide respon@@ ses and has also been strongly opposed by the palestinian islamic hol@@ y organization ( j@@ r ) .
palestine now has 6@@ 0,000 troops of security organizations .
moreover , fat@@ ah 's other members also have some organizational relations .
the chinese government , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of these countries ' own affairs and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te the power to manage security .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to control security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense agencies , and other organizations , and the new government 's interior ministry is under control .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no progress has been made .
