( selected newspaper coll@@ ections ) shanghai : part - time and college graduates become key workers
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau ( shanghai municipal ) released on the 6@@ th a guiding price for labor wages for the most new year of 2006 , with 120 posts , an increase of 11 previous posts , and a reduction in labor terms , compared with the previous one .
according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , currently more than 1 million people in shanghai 's work@@ force have already worked in the past few days .
according to a report by the china youth daily , college graduates and part - time personnel are the main components of the hour 's work force .
through the direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , half of the personnel are part - time personnel , and the proportion of them is 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the level of culture of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly engaged in work with a strong technical compet@@ ence , such as transl@@ ation and part - time workers , as high as 8@@ 1.7 percent , and 6@@ 1.6 percent of the people of fit@@ ness .
high incomes are the result of many people engaging in an hour - and - work part - time job .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be difficult to achieve , just like the trans@@ cri@@ ption of sound , and the monthly income of hours ' work posts can be more than 2,000 yuan . for example , part - time financial and social affairs are more than 2,000 yuan .
to satisfy their own interests , it is also an hour - long job to get a favor with them .
for example , when he was the manager of a company 's human resources department , he would spend a few hours a week to deal with the financial accounting accounts of a foreign - funded representative office .
mr. ko@@ o considers that the biggest benefits of the part - time job are to keep our knowledge more updated and that there is a chance to involve another field , of course , the income of the monthly 2000 yuan also has some attr@@ action .
as some of the hours - time jobs are low , the forms of work are flexible and free , and are gradually favor@@ ed by many graduates who are seeking employment , the number of hours of work is 14@@ 6 , and the number of graduates from tertiary and secondary schools has been on the rise for nearly three years .
i did not want to work in an hour at the beginning , but after several months of work , i felt it was better than five n@@ ights of the dprk .
after gradu@@ ating from college student huang , he did not find any job as he was . in the end , he put up a name at a hotel and used a pi@@ an@@ o to play a background music .
i am quite satisfied with my work at this moment , and the environment is 100 yuan an hour . what i want to do now is to find more hours of work .
it is understood that working hours has become a accumul@@ ation of work experience for some job - see@@ kers , and the enhancement of work skills in promoting work in the field of work experience and skills , and social experience .
the graduates are working in an hour , mainly in the knowledge and skills - like professional and professional - like - work - related skills - such as the relatively strong transl@@ ation and artistic positions of the times - - the ratio of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 3.@@ 6 % .
the number of hours ' work posts and skills required is not high , such as food promotion and shi@@ pment sur@@ ge@@ ons , and so on , and the unemployed personnel can take up posts through simple training .
data show that among the workers who used to work as unemployed , the ratio of the unemployed to the unemployed reached 3@@ 9@@ ,000 percent , among them is 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent of the retail workers , and the proportion of cat@@ ering and cat@@ ering industries is 5@@ 8.@@ 7 percent , with an hour - long job becoming an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

chinese expert : us ' un@@ justi@@ fied accus@@ ation ' of china 's military threat
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government has decided to establish a national defense system in the united states , the united states , the united states , russia , russia , russia , russia , and japan , the united states , to officially submit the " four - year defense review " to the us congress a few days ago .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation of china 's normal national defense construction , and plays up the military threat of china , and is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is a new national defense document of the pentagon .
the 92 - page report used three par@@ agr@@ ap@@ h@@ s to exp@@ ound china 's military power and the us should respond to the report , and the report directly mentioned 15 times that china has a super@@ ficial or in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive term , which says that it is a major issue and a new one .
a research fellow at the chinese academy of military sciences ' world military research department yao yun@@ zhu said that although us senior officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time that the us senior officials have put forward in the " report on the national defense strategy " that china is the most likely new big power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report clearly defin@@ es russia , the l@@ y@@ r@@ ics of india , as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called ( ( pw ) ) china 's military threat , and gives more attention to this .
major general peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is worth noting that in the " four - year defense assessment report " , the us president bush also sent a bill to the congress on the same day , which is the first time that the us defense budget for 2007 fiscal year is $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9 - billion .
if the united states and the united states are to step up their military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us defense budget for 2007 will break through $ 500 - billion , creating a new historical record , and p@@ ang guang@@ qian said , this is almost the same as that of other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian maintained that the united states has fabr@@ icated the un@@ eas@@ iness of other countries , reflecting the consistent style of creating enemies in the pentagon , and its real purpose is to strive for more defense funds and create a favorable environment for the us 's vast arms industry .
experts say that compared with the huge amount of us military spending , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many military experts , deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in the white paper on national defense , said that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has been on the decline .
official data show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounted for more than 20 percent of the national financial expenditure in the same period .
china 's defense spending in 2005 was 24@@ 4.@@ 65 - billion yuan , only about one - thir@@ ds of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about one - 60 percent of that of the united states . the average amount of military spending is approximately one - thir@@ ds of that of the us military .
the size of the us territory and the size of china 's territory are r@@ oughly the same , and the difference in military spending is so huge . who 's military strength exceeds the normal defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
wang yi , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become oppon@@ ents in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices defensive national defense policy .
china did not have any future experience , nor did it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established any military bases in other countries , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , and the united states has a history of over 100 military bases overseas , and only a few countries have deployed in asia .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , and comprehensively promote the sino - us constructive and cooperative relationship in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

( international observ@@ ations ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas 's cabinet has been seeking a breakthrough in its cabinet
xinhua news agency reporter wang hao
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
what new policy hamas will pursue will directly affect the peace process and the next step of the relevant parties ' policy direction .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tt has added vari@@ ables to the future of the hamas government .
at present , all the palestinian sides are stepping up consultation to discuss the issue of forming a cabinet that involves the difficulties and sensi@@ tivity of the future situation .
the premier 's position is spending on which family
after hamas obtained the right to form a cabinet , people are worried that the top prime minister of hamas may have differences with the current leader of ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ar , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , would not recognize israel , and this strong signal also intensified international worries .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed that they will not accept a hamas government with real power and use this to threaten to suspend economic aid to palestine and to transfer taxes to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments and to elect an independent person .
according to reports , in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the leaders of hamas and foreign countries who were concentr@@ ating in egypt recently decided to elect the chairman of the board of directors of the board of directors of the islamic university of jam@@ a@@ ica , ho@@ d@@ ard , as the new prime minister .
this move has not yet been responded by the relevant parties .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that no matter who is the prime minister 's office , the most important thing is that the prime minister should try his best to play down hamas 's un@@ com@@ promising color , and only in this way can he guarantee the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power
in terms of internal affairs , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is that there is a lack of governing experience .
the palestinian paper " sunday " analy@@ zes that hamas has concentrated in human resources through social welfare projects , but it has l@@ acked experience in governing and has a tradition of cooperation with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of governing .
hamas proposed to establish a political partnership with fat@@ ah after the election and jointly establish a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given any positive response to this .
at present , there is no difference in the opinions on whether to enter the cabinet , and the faction advocates participation in the new government , so that they can accomplish something , while the other faction refused to accept hamas , and is willing to be a pas@@ sive opposition in the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that , with ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to establish a legislative committee framework , which is separated from the cabinet of the parties .
according to reports , hamas has also designed a qing - type expert - type government , but the specific list is un@@ clear .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology - type government can not but become a form of cabinet that reli@@ es on external pressure .
according to the palestinian basic law , the new legislative council will hold a nom@@ in@@ ating and forming a cabinet after the new term of the legislative yuan on 16 february .
what path does the armed forces follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the new government .
the us and israel have taken a very hard - line attitude , resolutely demanding that hamas give up violence and refuse to hold a gun - wi@@ el@@ ding party in the administration .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ar stressed on 9 november that armed resistance is a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed forces issue is in fact a leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas elected legisl@@ ator first in the form of democracy and freedom , and has been recognized internationally , allowing its subordinate armed forces to be armed by y@@ ass@@ er ha@@ y@@ ami , the same way of leg@@ alization is to unify it into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify all factions into palestinian national forces , the armed forces , but did not have a broad response , and was also attacked by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ ack@@ son ) .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel and most of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some of the lo@@ ose subordinate armed factions , such as the y@@ ur@@ i marty@@ r brigade , the l@@ y@@ r@@ u fat@@ ah , and others .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must hold talks with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage the armed forces of each of these respective self - government and reason@@ ably alloc@@ ate security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as is interested in taking charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and is managed by the new government 's internal affairs department .
however , the parties concerned are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no further agreement has been made .

( winter olympics , stimul@@ ation ) news analysis : the dispatch of the child may not be a complete one .
du@@ bl@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the news analysis by news analysis : the issue of li@@ pp@@ a may not be settled .
xinhua news agency reporter gao ying
although italy has repeatedly said that the olympic games were un@@ covered during the tur@@ in winter olympics , the athletes who used stimul@@ ant may face un@@ necessary problems such as un@@ familiar pris@@ ons , but judging from various circumstances , this situation is unlikely to happen in the winter olympics .
the tur@@ in winter olympics opened on 16 november , the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al since its opening . o@@ il@@ le@@ ka was found to have used banned drug cards .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that le@@ ov@@ a had been sent out of the winter olympics , and she had won two gold med@@ als in the winter olympics .
the two international winter games have made a series of important decisions on the two - year ban for the tour@@ na@@ ment .
the international olympic committee has always stipulated that athletes have been found to use stimul@@ ant in the olympic games , and will be dis@@ qualified from participating in the games , but will not be punished by law .
however , according to italian law , the carrying and use of stimul@@ ant agents is a criminal act , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate and use stimul@@ ant athletes , and the law@@ break@@ ers are still facing three months to three years of un@@ equal imprisonment .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of un@@ rel@@ enting prices , finally reached an agreement on setting prices for the olympic games . both parties agreed to deal with the use of stimul@@ ant by athletes in accordance with italian law during this winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' place during the winter olympics , but the medic@@ inal - style athletes would still be subject to investigation by italian procuratorial organs .
according to reports , the italian government supervis@@ es the du@@ bl@@ in winter olympics , per@@ e@@ z k@@ an@@ tor has already sent the le@@ on@@ ov@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to the du@@ bl@@ in procuratorial organs .
however , the international olympic committee and per@@ e@@ z cam@@ pu@@ s themselves have not yet confirmed this .
russian team doctors and@@ er@@ son , two team members in winter , disclosed at noon on 17 august that le@@ on@@ id had left du@@ sh@@ an@@ ling and returned to china .
he was once a member of the chinese sports officials who had worked in the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years . he believed that once le@@ v returned to china , the matter could eventually be un@@ settled .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have made a lot of efforts to fight against stimul@@ ants in the winter olympics , and even italian procuratorial organs have really interven@@ ed in this matter , and it is hard to say .
according to the previous italian government 's judg@@ ement on the use of stimul@@ ant agents to their own athletes , the most severe punishment that the banned people have received is merely the two years of imprisonment and the bu@@ f@@ fer period .
therefore , the italian news agency 's senior reporter pi@@ er@@ re er@@ el@@ i said that the possibility of le@@ on@@ id entering the prison is very un@@ certain , and most of it is fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a de@@ fici@@ ency , italian police could not send le@@ on@@ ov@@ a to the country to take him back and serve .
if le@@ on@@ ka ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will have no way to take her .
