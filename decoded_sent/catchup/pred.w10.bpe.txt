according to an estimate by relevant experts of the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , at present , the number of hours employees in shanghai has exceeded 1 million .
according to a report by china youth daily , graduates and part - time staff of colleges and universities are the main component of the working class .
through direct investigations of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the staff are part - time workers , and the proportion of them is 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally higher , mainly in work with a strong technical level , such as transl@@ ation , part - time staff , up to 8@@ 1.@@ 17 percent , and fit@@ ness level up to 6@@ 1.@@ 66 percent .
high income is an important reason why many people are working for hours .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual positions can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and the first is difficult to find , just as the voice is trans@@ mitted , and the monthly income of the working hours can reach more than 2,000 yuan . for example , the part - time financial staff , like the jing@@ ji shi@@ qing si@@ yi , etc.
to satisfy individual interests and expand their knowledge , it is also a major part of the work to be favor@@ ed by working hours .
for example , mr. gu , who is the manager of a certain enterprise , will take several hours a week to handle the work of the financial account of a certain foreign - funded representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the most important part - time earn@@ ings were the continu@@ al up@@ d@@ ating of his knowledge and the opportunity to involve another field . of course , the income of the 2,000 yuan per month also has a certain amount of attr@@ action .
as some hours of work posts have low employment thre@@ sh@@ old , the working style is flexible and free , and many of the graduates who are seeking employment are gradually favor@@ ing . among the working hours , 14@@ -@@ 4 percent are college graduates for nearly three years .

after gradu@@ ating from college student huang , the job he found was not satisfactory . finally , he hung up his name at a hotel and used a pi@@ an@@ o to play background music .
i am very satisfied with my current work , and the environment is good for one hour , and i am now trying to find a few hours of workers , like a few hours of workers , a few hours of workers .
it is understood that working hours have become a part of the experience of some graduates who are seeking jobs to accumul@@ ate experience , improve their skills in work , improve communication skills , and increase social records .
the main reason for graduates to work in an hour is their knowledge and skills , such as those with relatively strong professional interpre@@ ters , times and characteristics , and their artistic skills with a strong sense of profession@@ alism .
if the technical requirements for part - time workers are not high , such as food promo@@ ters and sal@@ es@@ man , etc. , the unemployed can get jobs through simple training .
data show that among the hours ' workers , the proportion of those who used to work as unemployed reached 3@@ 9.@@ 0 percent , of whom the proportion of unemployed people in retail categories reached 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of those in the cat@@ ering industry was 5@@ 8.@@ 7@@ 9 percent , and that the hours of work became an important channel for the unemployed to find jobs .

prc expert : us pre@@ ach@@ ing ' china threat ' ground@@ less accus@@ ation
beijing , february 9 ( xinhua ) the chinese government will continue to provide assistance to the congress in the " 4 - year defense review report " , which was officially submitted by the pentagon to congress recently , said for the first time that china is the most likely emerging power that may pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is an unreasonable accus@@ ation of china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating the china military threat theory is an interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense evaluation report " is a new document of the pentagon 's guidance for national defense .
the report , which has been up to 92 p@@ ages , has used three sections to explain the military power of china and the ways the united states should adopt to deal with the situation , directly mentioned china , or china , two terms , which are two phr@@ ases , namely , china , or china . as a major and emerging power , china has the most potential to engage in military competition with the united states ; if the united states does not have any countermeasures , china may develop military technology , and develop
yao yun@@ zhu , resear@@ cher of the world military research department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said : although senior us officials have expressed similar viewpoints many times before , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in the defense strategy report that china is the newly emerging power that is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report clearly defin@@ es russia 's relationship with china as a newly emerging strategic ad@@ versary , especially the so - called ' the china threat theory ' , for the first time .
major general peng guang@@ qian , resear@@ cher of the chinese academy of military sciences , said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that the report on the fourth - year defense review was formally submitted on the same day , and us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 fiscal budget , of which the defense budget was 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion us dollars .
if the military action is added to the budget for iraq and afghanistan , the us military budget for 2007 will break through the 500 - billion - dollar barri@@ er , creating a new record , and peng guang@@ qian said , adding that this is almost the same as the other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said that the united states has mis@@ calcul@@ ated the pentagon 's ability to create enemies ' bad style of ' theory of threat of other countries ' and its true purpose is to win more national defense funds and to make greater contributions to the huge us arms industry groups .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
military expert deng hong@@ zhou , who had participated in many times the white paper on national defense , said : since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased somewhat , but the proportion of national fiscal expenditure in the same period has been on the decline .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditure accounts for a decrease of nearly 10 percentage points in 2004 and that of the same period of the year .
china 's defense spending in 2005 is 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , which is only about one - tenth of the united states ' national defense spending , and the per - capita military expenditure is only about one - sixth of the united states , and the per - capita military expenditure is about one - third of the us military 's .
the united states ' land area and china 's territory are r@@ oughly similar , but the difference in military expenditure is so huge , which military power is actually exceeding the legitimate defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
teng jian@@ q@@ un , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the united states should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate the situation of china 's military construction , and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become milit@@ arily ad@@ vers@@ aries .
the white paper on china 's national defense in 2004 says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and pursu@@ es a defensive national defense policy .
china did not have a future either in the past or now , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has only been deployed in asia for over 100,000 people .
professor zhu feng of the international relations college of beijing university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century to jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas cabinet seeks breakthroughs
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) hamas has formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 20 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of a legislative council , and how to draw a blueprint for the new administration has become the focus of attention in the international community at present .
what kind of new policy will hamas directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in the next step of their policy direction .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the issues of the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of the cabinet , which involve future developments in the situation .
how can the premier 's position be fl@@ own ?
after hamas won the cabinet , some people in the outside world were worried that hamas prime minister she@@ i@@ k@@ h al-@@ aq@@ sa might have a dispute with the top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader mo@@ ham@@ ad , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government , which was formed by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also intensified international anx@@ ie@@ ty .
the united states and israel explicitly indicated that they would not accept a hamas government that has real power , and threatened to break off economic aid to palestine and to hand over taxes to palestine .
however , this does not obstruc@@ t the flexible strategic adjustment of hamas , and the election of an independent person is a compromise .
according to reports , in order to obtain international recognition to the greatest extent , hamas leaders at home and abroad , who are gathering in egypt recently , decided to elect an independent ma@@ q@@ ab@@ ay@@ a hol@@ y , chairman of the board of directors of the s@@ ak@@ al@@ ta islamic university , as new prime minister .
this move has not yet received the response from the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hos@@ se@@ in said that the most crucial thing is the prime minister 's choice as far as possible to less@@ en hamas 's hard - line t@@ one , and only thus can the cabinet be guaranteed .
how to distribu@@ te power ( sub@@ head )
in the internal aspect , the biggest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
in an analysis published in the palestinian newspaper , shi@@ h pao said that hamas has ass@@ em@@ bled people through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and is closely linked with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has experience in governance .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing a political partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly formed a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
within fat@@ ah , there are different opinions on whether to enter the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government , thus making some achievements , while the other faction ref@@ uses to invite hamas , and is willing to be a positive opposition party at the legislative yuan .
the informed source pointed out that , under ab@@ b@@ as 's persu@@ asion , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even if this is the case , hamas and fat@@ ah will also barg@@ ain over the distribution of cabinet positions .
in addition , another way is to separate the formation of a legislative yuan from a cabinet of con@@ sor@@ ti@@ a .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean and expert government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technological expert - type government can not be regarded as a form of cabinet formation that can reduce external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " after the new legislative yuan was inaug@@ ur@@ ated on 16 february , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming a cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
what course the armed forces should follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny issue facing the new government .
the us and israel have adopted a very tough attitude and resolutely demanded hamas to abandon violence and refuse to take part in political affairs .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ar stressed on 9 may that armed resistance was a strategic choice of the organization .
the armed issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the issue of the ownership of armed forces .
hamas is the first largest party to be elected through democracy and freedom , and has been recognized internationally . its subordinate armed factions , like q@@ ass@@ am brig@@ ades , are also leg@@ alized .
hamas once proposed that all factions be re@@ unified to serve the palestinian national authority , but did not receive a wide - ranging response , and was also opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had ( j@@ had ) .
palestine now has over 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , there are also armed factions in fat@@ ah , which are lo@@ ose in organizational relations , such as the mas@@ an@@ jia marty@@ rs brig@@ ades , the mas@@ an@@ jia , the fat@@ ah , and so on .
hamas , which is responsible for forming a cabinet , must reach an agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are under their own jurisdiction and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management powers .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to be in charge of security and intelligence units , police , civil defense , and other organizations , but the new government 's ministry of interior will be under the control of the ministry of internal affairs .
however , the parties concerned are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further question .
china issues polar observation report
beijing , february 10 ( xinhua ) china 's national oce@@ an@@ ic administration recently issued the " 2005 china polar survey report " , which is a major event in china 's polar scientific expedi@@ tion activities over the past 20 years and more .

according to the " report , " at 22@@ :@@ 15 on 9 january 2005 ( beijing time ) , the ant@@ arc@@ tic of china 's southern region det@@ ected a successful h@@ ill@@ top ice - covered ice - covered ice - covered ice - covered area at the top of the ant@@ arc@@ tic . at 3@@ :@@ 15 on 18 january , it also decided to record the highest point of the ice - blue wall 's highest peak at the beijing time .
the united states is now making a big contribution to the development of the world 's economy .
sun zhi@@ hui , director of the state oce@@ an@@ ic administration , said :
the " report " shows that on 24 march 2005 , the 21 st expedi@@ tion team of the ant@@ arc@@ tic of china returned to shanghai after successfully completing its mission . the inspection lasted 15@@ 1 days and has a vo@@ y@@ age of 2,@@ 6@@ 500 n@@ au@@ tical miles .
on 18 november of the same year , the 22@@ nd expedi@@ tion team of china 's ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion left shanghai and went to the ant@@ arc@@ tic zhong@@ shan station to conduct the scientific expedi@@ tion . it will leave the zhong@@ shan station by the end of february 2006 and return to shanghai via australia .
since it was the first time that china issued the polar observation report , the " 2005 china polar survey report " also set a new and higher standard for china 's polar research , which started in the early 1980 s .
according to the " report , " china formally joined the " ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty " in 198@@ 3 , becoming a member of the ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty organization , and successively becoming a member of the n@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic treaty consultation committee on the n@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific research council , the council of the bureau of directors of the ant@@ arc@@ tic international organization , and other most influential members of the international organization for international affairs .
in 1997 , china became a member of the arc@@ tic science committee , and won the right to speak and make decisions in international polar affairs .
the " report " points out that over the past 20 years , china 's polar observation has never come to a certain place , constantly developed , and initially built three main stations , namely , the three - stop ship@@ building , the north pol@@ e scientific research system , namely , the north pol@@ e - north pol@@ e long town station built in february 198@@ 5 , the ant@@ arc@@ tic central mountain station built in february 1989 , and the north pol@@ e station established in july 2004 , and the north pol@@ e station
according to statistics , by the end of 2005 , china has organized 22 ant@@ arc@@ tic scientific expedi@@ tion and 2 nd inspection tour of the southern pol@@ e , with the snow - covered snow - cap@@ ped ship as the second batch of north pol@@ e scientific observation station on p@@ ing@@ tai , and so far more than 3,000 people have been inspected in the southern p@@ ond to inspect the site of the north pol@@ e .
currently , we are working hard to build the third ant@@ arc@@ tic expedi@@ tion station , and is also china 's first inland ant@@ arc@@ tic inland inland station to conduct feasibility study and investigation .
sun zhi@@ hui said :
after more than 20 years of efforts , china 's polar expedi@@ tion has been a major part of the world 's polar research , but it is still far from being compared to other major polar observation countries .
he said .
sun zhi@@ hui disclosed that china will publish an extremely study report annually in the future .

japanese researchers develop new highly efficient human kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research institute of the east china sea university of japan has developed a kind of biological human@@ s kid@@ ney , which is not only similar to the kid@@ ney kid@@ ney of human@@ s , but also has the functions of re@@ taining the material elements , and is small in volume and easy to trans@@ plant . as the research is carried out in depth , it is expected to bring fu@@ yuan to kid@@ ney patients .
according to a report by ni@@ hon ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news a few days ago , the newly developed biological man - made kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and the part is the fil@@ tr@@ ation of the d@@ ai@@ m@@ i and the sal@@ on people who are engaged in water . the other part is the use of the original ur@@ ine di@@ ving and the d@@ it@@ ch of the blood re@@ returned to the p@@ y@@ ne@@ dy p@@ ad@@ dy , which is a case of careful calcul@@ ation .
the people of the village are very famous in the chinese air , and the people of the building of a kid@@ ney , the carefully and carefully built the sil@@ k line , and the inside side of the building is full of the functions of sub@@ stitu@@ ting the waste .

these challenges include the regional short - term shortage of electricity in the area of bas@@ el , and the situation of power supply and demand in some areas remains tight , and because the good mechanism of coal prices has not yet taken shape , there is still a big problem in coal supply , and at the same time , the problem of the reduction in coal quality has not been effectively brought under control , which will have a serious impact on the stable operation of power generating units , and the weak power supply system will
shi y@@ um@@ u@@ bo said : as the reform of the power system deep@@ ens , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed . how to maintain the stability of the workers ' contingent and ensure the normal production order will become a new problem facing us .

in 2005 , china 's total electricity consumption will reach 24@@ 6@@ 8@@ 9.@@ 9 billion kil@@ ow@@ at@@ t - hours , up 13.@@ 45 percent over the same period of last year .
in the face of the situation of power supply and demand , such as the situation of shortage of power supply and demand , the contradiction between coal , electricity , oil , and transportation , all electric power enterprises have earnestly adopted effective measures to strengthen equipment management , and there was no major equipment accident in the whole country last year .
the number of accidents involving power gr@@ i@@ ds decreased by 1@@ 27 , while the number of accidents involving equipment decreased by 4@@ 27 , down by 13@@ 2 compared with the same period last year .
south african envoy to china said that there is no organized crime in south africa and that china is a citizen .
beijing , february 13 ( xinhua ) south african embassy in china is here today to attend the opening ceremony of the south african embassy in china , con@@ cor@@ d , the charge d@@ '@@ aff@@ ai@@ res ad interim of south africa 's chinese embassy in china , said a senior official here today .
he also said that the south african government will do its utmost to crack down on all forms of crime .
the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every person in south africa will be able to lead the crime to zero , said the minister .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another , and the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to the south african side over this issue and reminded chinese nationals in southern africa to further enhance their sense of security and prevention . overseas chinese should strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in fighting criminal activities .
tu@@ g@@ yi expressed the most sincere sympathy and condol@@ ences to the families of the victims .
" we are sor@@ ry for this , and we also want the chinese people to believe that the south african government is seriously investigating every case involving china , " said fu .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked a case of chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing 's murder in south africa on february 5 , and a suspect has been arrested .
the police are now hun@@ ting for another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminals suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen in january this year were arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims was recovered .
speaking on the possible impact of the murder of chinese citizens , fu k@@ on@@ in said that these incidents indeed would have a serious impact on the trade and other fields between the two countries and on the exchanges between them , but from a long - term point of view , the impact on the region should not be too big .
the chinese embassy in south africa has been conducting a special investigation and study on the chinese people 's health and food safety in the first 15 days of this year , said the south african embassy commissioner for tourism , n@@ el@@ son .
according to chinese official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain china 's largest trade partner in africa by 2005 .
the volume of bilateral trade reached $ 7.@@ 27 - billion , up 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , people in the tourism circles believe that the successive murder of chinese citizens in 2004 has a significant impact on the number of chinese tourists visiting south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism administration , in the first half of 2005 , the number of chinese tourists going to south africa was 20@@ 3@@ 31 , down by 14.@@ 9@@ 9 percent over the same period last year .
currently , there are about 200,000 chinese living in south africa , and the villages and towns in south africa are all sc@@ attered .
analysts here believe that the widening gap between the rich and the poor in south africa , the high unemployment rate , and the flood of guns , are not de@@ ter@@ red by the death penalty , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not know english , they have cash with their families , and they are more likely to become targets of criminal elements ' money - seeking attacks .

( winter olympics , d@@ oping ) news analysis : the incident of sending out a national drug may not be a problem .
du@@ ling@@ ling , february 17 ( xinhua ) the incident of sending out a national flag may not be settled
xinhua news agency reporter , gao peng ,
although italy repeatedly issued an order , the situation of using the br@@ ail@@ le to use was likely to be faced by the hel@@ l during the tur@@ in winter games , but now it is still difficult to see the situation from various circumstances .
since the opening of the tur@@ in winter games on 16 june , the first d@@ oping scand@@ al has been discovered , and the or@@ a has been found to have used banned drug cards .
the next day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent li@@ u@@ ba to the winter olympics , and she won the first two winter games in the current winter olympics . her personal card for the women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual games has also been stri@@ pped .
the international winter games two league made a decision on the same day to launch the two - year ban on the sec@@ ular games .
the i@@ oc has always stipulated that athletes have been found to be using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games , and will be dis@@ qualified from participating in the games , but will not be punished by the law .
however , according to italian law , the athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants are a criminal act , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and the law@@ break@@ ers who have been def@@ ended for three months to three years are still facing the same imprisonment .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to hold the first meeting in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made concessions four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' place during the winter olympics , but athletes with positive drug prosecu@@ tions will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organ .
some reports say that the italian government supervis@@ es the tur@@ in winter games officials , p@@ ast@@ or , who has sent li@@ u@@ f@@ fl@@ es to the re@@ ling procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and pe@@ ter k@@ r@@ ish@@ nan have not yet confirmed this .
the two teams of the russian winter games , and@@ re@@ w , revealed at noon on the 17 th that they had sent li@@ u@@ ba to leave tur@@ in and return to the country .
he has been working for many years in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agency , and chinese sports officials , shi k@@ ang@@ cheng , believes that once the li@@ ang@@ a is sent back to china , this matter may eventually be settled without mer@@ cy .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said : the international olympic committee and the italian government have always been un@@ ru@@ ly on the issue of anti - d@@ oping in the winter olympics . even if the italian procuratorial organs really interven@@ e in this matter , it is still hard to say .
according to the previous ruling of the italian government on the use of d@@ oping in the country 's athletes , the most serious punishment imposed by the banned people is no more than the two years of imprisonment and a period of time for execution .
therefore , a senior journalist of the italian am@@ is@@ a said that the possibility of sending a le@@ af to the prison is very rare , and most of them are fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be tried in a short@@ fall , the italian police could not possibly send li@@ u@@ ba abroad to serve the sentence .
if a le@@ af is sent to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , the italian side will also have no way to take her .
