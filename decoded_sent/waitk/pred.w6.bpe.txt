the director of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences yao yun@@ zhu said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar viewpoints , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy report that china is the emerging big power that may most likely pose a military challenge to the united states .
this report will clearly define the role of russia as a newly emerging strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called military threat against china , as a matter of concern .
peng guang@@ qian , research fellow of the chinese academy of military sciences ,
what merits attention is that in the " report on the review of defense in four years , " us president bush also submitted to congress a report on the government budget for the fiscal year 2007 , including a defense budget of $ 4@@ 3.@@ 3 - billion .
if we add the new measures to carry out military operations in iraq and afghanistan , the us national defense budget for fiscal 2007 will exceed $ 500 - billion , setting a historic high , and peng guang@@ qian said that the level of " the united states is almost equivalent to the total military spending of all other countries in the world . "
peng guang@@ qian said : the united states ' gu@@ ess@@ ing of the theory of the ' le@@ pros@@ y of other countries ' reflects the consistent style of creating an enemy 's fur@@ y , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to obtain more profits for the huge us arms industry group .
experts say that compared with the huge us military spending , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in many times the comp@@ il@@ ation of china 's national defense white paper deng hong@@ zhou said : since the 1990 's , with economic development , china 's national defense expenditures have increased somewhat , but the proportion of national defense expenditures in the same period has generally declined .
official figures show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense expenditures accounted for a lower proportion of the state 's fiscal expenditures for the same period of the year .
china 's defense spending for 2005 will be 24@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , only one - fourth of the us military spending , and the per capita national military spending will be about one - sixth that of the united states , and the per capita military spending is about one - thir@@ ds of the us military .
the land area of the united states and china 's territory are generally fairly large , but the difference in military spending is so huge . who 's military power that exceeds the normal defense needs . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
the chinese side is willing to strengthen cooperation with the us side in the fields of arms control and disarmament , and to make joint efforts to promote the healthy development of sino - us military relations .
the " white paper on china 's national defense " for 2004 said : china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has not been able to do anything in the future , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , and the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
zhu feng , professor at the beijing university 's international relations college , said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote the maintenance of world peace and development .

hamas 's cabinet seeks new solution
ram@@ m@@ a , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas cabinet has been formed to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , beijing , by wang hao and huang
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw a new government blueprint has become the focus of attention in the international community .
what kind of new policy will hamas pursue will directly affect the relevant parties in the peace process in their next policy direction .
at the same time , the us and israel 's bo@@ y@@ co@@ tting attitude has added vari@@ ables to the prospects of the hamas government .
at present , all parties in palestine are stepping up consultations to discuss the difficulties and sensitive points in the formation of a cabinet that will affect future developments .
the prime minister 's post has been fl@@ owing down , and who has lost his job ?
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some people outside the world are worried that the prime minister 's v@@ ague might have differences with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
moreover , hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led by hamas would not recognize israel , and this tough signal has aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their ref@@ us@@ al to accept a hamas government that has the real power , and threatened to cut off their economic aid to palestine and to transfer the tax to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of an independent person is a compromise .
it is reported that in order to obtain international recognition to the maximum , the hamas leaders at home and abroad , who have gathered in egypt , decided to select an independent member of the board of directors of the q@@ am@@ do islamic university , j@@ ah@@ r@@ h@@ ad@@ i , to become the new prime minister .
this move has not yet received the response of the parties concerned .
palestinian analy@@ st hus@@ se@@ in said that no matter who will be in the prime minister 's office , the most important thing is that the prime minister should try his best to less@@ en the hard - line color of hamas , only in this way can he guarantee the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power
inter@@ n@@ ally , the biggest challenge facing the hamas cabinet is that it lacks sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily newspaper carried an analysis saying that hamas , through social welfare projects , has gathered together people 's morale , but in the aspect of governance , it lacks experience and has a close relationship with the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience in governing .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah and jointly forming a national coalition government , but fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this .
at present , there is no difference between the opinion of fat@@ ah in the cabinet , and one faction advocates participating in the new government , so as to do something , while the other faction ref@@ uses to accept hamas 's invitation . it is willing to actively dis@@ close the opposition parties in the legislative council .
the informed sources pointed out that under ab@@ b@@ as 's advice , fat@@ ah gradually incl@@ ined to join the new government .
even so , the two sides will also exchange views on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to organize a legislative council framework to break away from the alliance of parties .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and expert - like government , but the specific list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technology expert - type government will not lose sight of the form of forming a cabinet to reduce external pressure .
according to the provisions of the basic law of palestine , after the new legislative council takes office on 16 june , the work of nom@@ in@@ ating the prime minister and forming the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks .
how should the armed forces go ?
the weapons in hamas are another major thor@@ ny issue confron@@ ting the new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very tough attitude , and resolutely demanded that hamas abandon violence and rej@@ ect the use of guns to participate in politics .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ m@@ oud ah@@ mar stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the strategic choice of the organization .
armed issues actually include the leg@@ ality of weapons and the management of the armed forces .
hamas 's election through democratic and free means the election of the first major party of the legislative council has been acknowledged internationally , and the li@@ ke@@ wise , the way to leg@@ alize its subordinate armed factions is to unify them into the government 's security organs .
hamas once proposed to unify the various factions into a palestinian national authority , but it did not receive a general response , and was also opposed by the palestinian islamic ji@@ had organization ( j@@ as@@ want ) .
palestine currently has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , most of which come from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , fat@@ ah has some members of the armed factions that have lo@@ os@@ ened their organizational relations , such as the " great army of the chinese army " of the marxist marty@@ rs ' brig@@ ades of arm@@ is@@ a , and so on .
hamas , who is responsible for forming the cabinet , must have a consensus with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are independent of their own , and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te the authority for security management .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , police and civil defense organizations , and other organizations , but they are managed by the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far there is no further report .

japanese researchers develop new highly efficient kid@@ ney - flu
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) the research personnel of the east china sea university of japan have developed a biological kid@@ ney - making kid@@ ney , which is not only in line with human kid@@ ney 's dis@@ ability , but also has the function of preserving the function of material ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents . moreover , it is small in size and easy to trans@@ plant . with the in - depth research , it is expected that the patients with kid@@ ney diseases will be able to have a for@@ ens@@ ation .
according to a report by the " ni@@ k@@ ke@@ iz@@ ai industrial news " a few days ago , the newly developed bio@@ man - made kid@@ ney is mainly composed of a group of arti@@ st@@ es who fil@@ ter the tr@@ ac@@ es of waste and water from the blood , and the part is the re - entry of the original st@@ ur@@ dy , ur@@ ine , and meth@@ ane patients with blood returned to the hospital with their family components , such as ur@@ ine , ur@@ ine , and tu@@ be .
the human kid@@ ney - making ag@@ ent , the ag@@ ent - made ur@@ ine , was made by the sk@@ in w@@ ire , and the head of the body of the ag@@ ate was filled with the function of dis@@ charging the waste .
this kind of h@@ ose cell@@ s can enable the disease to be tested in a continuous , continuous , and solid , inter@@ related , trans@@ form@@ ative , and trans@@ form@@ able , as a result of material separation into am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id and blood , and at the same time , it can also enable the body 's ac@@ id , its body , and its material , to enter the blood .

these challenges include regional fr@@ ag@@ m@@ entary dis@@ orders , lack of electricity , and supply in some areas , and the situation of power supply and demand remains rather tight , and the power supply remains relatively serious because the ben@@ ign mechanism for power supply has not yet taken shape . at the same time , the problem of the drop in coal quality has not been effectively controlled , and the stable operation of power generating units will seriously affect the stability of the power gr@@ id structure , the old equipment , and the situation
shi said that with the deepening of the reform of the power system , many deep - se@@ ated contradictions will continue to be exposed , and how to maintain the stability of the staff and workers and ensure normal production order will become new problems facing them .
in view of the work of electric power safety in 2006 , shi yu@@ bo said : we should further strengthen the foundation of the work of production safety in electric power , speed up the establishment and improvement of an emergency management mechanism for power safety , enhance the capacity to deal with conting@@ encies , strengthen coordination and cooperation between power networks , and jointly safeguard the safety of power supply systems , continue to do a good job in supervising and managing the dam 's safety , strengthen the management of power construction safety , and further

he also said that the south african government will do its best to crack down on all forms of crime .
he said the south african government hopes to reduce the crime rate to zero , and hopes that every south african country working in south africa will be able to secure their lives and property and the local law and citizens .
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have been killed in south africa one after another , and the chinese people in the world have expressed extensive concern over this .
the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa over this issue and reminded chinese citizens in southern africa to further enhance their awareness of security and prevention , and the overseas chinese compatriots to strengthen unity and friendship and cooperate with the police in cracking down on criminal activities .
we told the victims ' family that we sincerely symp@@ ath@@ ize with and m@@ our@@ n them .
fu k@@ ang@@ ning said : we are very sor@@ ry about this and ask the chinese people to believe that the south african government is earnestly investigating every case involving china .
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , the south african police have successfully cracked the case of a murder of a chinese fujian woman chen jian@@ qing in south africa on february 5 , and a suspect has been arrested .
at present , the police are hun@@ ting another suspect .
according to the south african embassy in china , the criminal suspect who was suspected of shooting hong kong businessmen in january this year has been arrested by south african police , and the property of the victims has been recovered .
speaking on the possibility of the occurrence of the incident of chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation , fu k@@ ang@@ ing said that these incidents indeed have a great impact on the trade between the two countries , including trade between them , and on the other fields , but from a long - term point of view , the impact should not be too big .
according to the tourism commissioner of the south african embassy , the embassy provided a total of 2,000 chinese visitors to the south african country in the first 15 days of this year .
according to official statistics , south africa will continue to maintain its position as the largest trade partner in africa in 2005 .
the bilateral trade volume reached $ 7.@@ 27 - billion , an increase of 2@@ 3.@@ 0 percent over the same period last year .
however , the tourism sector believes that the chinese citizens ' ass@@ as@@ sin@@ ation incidents that have occurred in 2004 have a significant impact on the number of tourists from china to south africa .
according to statistics from the south african tourism board , chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 were 20@@ 31 , down 14.@@ 9@@ 3 percent from the same period last year .
the chinese living in south africa now have about 200,000 people , and the towns and villages in south africa are all located .
analysts here believe that the gap between south africa and the rich and poor in the society is widening , the unemployment rate is high , and there is no deterr@@ ent to death , so the crime rate is still high .
because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies and their homes , and this is more pr@@ one to become targets of criminal elements ' financial attacks .

china : state administration of safety supervision to control coal mine accidents
beijing , february 17 ( xinhua ) four major accidents have occurred one after another in beijing , with more than 100 people in the past year , and the grim situation of production safety across the country has caused the pollution of severe coal mine accidents , including the china - t@@ eng@@ fei coal mine , to become the most important among the top priority in the work of supervising safety in the whole country this year .
this reporter learned from the state administration of production safety on 17 july that in order to effectively check the occurrence of serious and serious accidents , such as coal mines , coal mines should be the most important among the most important things .
this year , the state administration of coal mine safety will do the following three things :
sh@@ aw continues to fight a battle against v@@ an@@ as .
the w@@ ac@@ s management this year has put the pul@@ se in a prominent position .
if the high gas mine is not in a position to pul@@ l out , it is necessary to order it to suspend production immediately .
sh@@ oug@@ ou continues to fight a battle of consolidation and closing down .
we should make the 5@@ 2@@ 43 public notice , and with the recent reports by all localities , more than 700 coal mines , one that have been reported to have been shu@@ t down and put it in a true position .
we should regard closing down as a routine task , and continually close down those enterprises that cause pollution to resources that do not have safety requirements .
prc : qi@@ u@@ shi steps up safety management in coal mines
we should immediately correct the unhealthy tend@@ encies of the management of a small number of large state - owned mines and establish a standardized security management system for small mines that are in a chao@@ tic situation in their management .
in particular , we must grasp key state - owned coal mines , and absolutely not allow over@@ capacity , over@@ capacity , and over@@ capacity production of key personnel .
this year 's production safety control indices demand that the number of deaths of all types across the country dropped by 3@@ -@@ 3 percent from the previous year , of which coal mines dropped by 3.@@ 5 percent .
one death tol@@ l of more than 10 people was reduced by 5 percent , of which coal mines dropped by 7 percent .
these control indices have been assigned to provincial - level people 's governments , and all localities are now implementing them at the grassroots level and enterprises .
statistics show that in 2005 , 5@@ 9@@ 86 people were killed in coal mine accidents , a drop of 0.@@ 7@@ 9 percent from the same period last year .
however , the number of major accidents involving more than 10 people who died in one incident rose to 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent from the same period last year .

( winter olympics games , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : there is a possibility that the dispatch of the v@@ in@@ cent incident will not end .
du@@ sh@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the announcement of the new del@@ hi pref@@ ectural government said that the new government will not be able to resolve the problem
xinhua news agency , gao ying ,
although italy has repeatedly ordered that the tur@@ in winter olympic games are being discovered to use stimul@@ ants , all athletes may face j@@ ol@@ as , but they are now facing the difficulties of the disease .
the tur@@ in winter olympic games opened on the 16@@ th , the first stimul@@ ant scand@@ al that opened . al@@ ex@@ and@@ er al@@ ex@@ and@@ er was found to have used a drug - free card .
the international olympic committee announced the next day that the al@@ e@@ a had been sent out of the winter olympics , and she won two winter games in the winter games , 15 kilometers of silver med@@ als in the two con@@ tests of the games .
the international winter winter league made a decision on the same day to send a two - year ban v@@ a .
the i@@ oc has been providing for athletes to be identified with stimul@@ ant in the olympic games , and will be depriv@@ ed of their quali@@ fication for the games , but not legally sanc@@ tioned .
however , according to italian law , the chinese athletes ' carrying and using stimul@@ ants are a criminal act , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants and to test the legal persons for three months to three years .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of l@@ ap@@ se for r@@ ough harv@@ ard , finally reached an agreement , and both sides agreed to handle the stimul@@ ant incident by athletes in accordance with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a four - day concession before the opening of the winter olympics games , and promised that the police would not enter the olympic village to conduct a search on the athle@@ te 's residence during the winter olympics . however , the athletes who have demonstrated positive drug examination will still be investigated by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government over@@ sees the tur@@ in winter olympics , pe@@ ter per@@ t@@ z , an official of the italian government , has already handed over the stimul@@ ant incident to the du@@ tch procuratorial organs .
however , the international olympic committee and per@@ t@@ inent persons have not yet confirmed this matter .
russia 's winter - 2 team medical and health minister dem@@ i@@ re@@ v revealed at noon on 17 september that the al@@ e@@ jan@@ dr@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
he has been a member of the chinese sports official , who has been working in the world 's anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , and said that once the le@@ av@@ er returned to china , this incident could eventually be a r@@ ough blow .
shi said that the i@@ oc and the italian government have been fighting against stimul@@ ants in the winter olympics , and have not resolved all the problems , even if italian procuratorial organs really involve themselves in this matter , it is hard to say .
in the past , italy 's response to the use of stimul@@ ant events shows that the biggest pen@@ alties that the banned has received are only two years of imprisonment , suspended for execution .
therefore , a senior italian am@@ az@@ a reporter pi@@ er@@ re said that the possibility of sending le@@ av@@ a to j@@ ail was very small , and that was , most of the time , a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could def@@ er the trial , the italian police could not send a v@@ il@@ la@@ in to foreign countries to take back the trial .
if the v@@ il@@ la@@ ins were sent to refuse to accept the verdic@@ t , italy would have nothing to do with her .
