xinhua news agency , beijing , february 9 ( reporter li xu@@ an@@ liang ) - - the us pentagon recently made a formal report to the congress on the " four - year defense assessment report " which was officially submitted to the us congress . it said that china 's most valuable experience could be the emerging power that could pose a military challenge to the united states .
experts believe that this is a challenge to china 's normal national defense construction , and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating china 's military threat theory is a serious interference in china 's internal affairs .
the " four - year defense assessment report " is the latest defense guidance document of the pentagon .
this report , which lasted as long as 92 p@@ ages , has expounded on china 's military strength in three sections and the us response , and has reported on 15 occasions directly to china 's western region or its western china 's pin@@ n@@ ac@@ le , and its l@@ y@@ r@@ ic , as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential in conducting military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have any anti - measures , china may very break the traditional military superiority , thus
china 's academy of military sciences , the world military research department , said that although senior us officials have repeatedly expressed similar viewpoints , this is the first time that the united states has made such a proposal in its national defense strategy report , and china is the most likely emerging power that could pose a military challenge to the united states .
the main reason for this report clearly defin@@ es russia for the first time as a new strategic competi@@ tor , especially the so - called " china threat theory " , has given more attention to the issue . the report has more attention .
china 's academy of military sciences resear@@ cher peng guang@@ qian said :
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that in the " four - year defense assessment report " formally submitted to the united states , us president bush also submitted to congress the 2007 government budget , of which the defense budget was $ 4@@ 3.@@ 9@@ 3 - billion .
the main reason is that if the united states and the united states continue to cooperate with the united states in the coming years , the military action budget for iraq and afghanistan will exceed $ 500 billion in 2007 , setting a historic high . peng guang@@ qian said that this is almost the same as the total military spending and the actual military spending of all other countries in the world .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us plot to create false threat from other countries reflects the pentagon 's ability to produce enemy 's per@@ v@@ as@@ ive style , and its real purpose is to strive for more national defense funds and to win more support for the us m@@ uni@@ tions industry group .
experts said that compared with the enormous military out@@ la@@ ys of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
zeng qinghong , member of the political bureau of the cpc central committee and vice premier of the state council , said that , as china 's national defense spending has increased since the 1990 s , it accounted for a fairly small percentage of the state 's expenditures in the same period .
the official figures show that the volume of trade between the two countries increased by 2@@ 3.@@ 2 percent in 2004 and 1979 , compared with 1979 .
200@@ 0@@ -@@ 2005 china 's defense expenditure is 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 - billion yuan , equivalent to about 1 / 14 of the united states , and the per capita military spending of the people is only about 1 / 60 of the us , and the per capita military spending is about 1 / 30 of the us military .
the united states ' land area and china 's territorial land are generally quite large , and the military spending is so huge , but the military strength is in the end beyond the proper defense needs . this is self - evident . this is self - evident . this is self - evident .
peng guang@@ qian said :
china arms control and disarmament association research department director teng jian@@ q@@ un said that the us side should obj@@ ectively assess the situation of china 's military construction , and china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their military ri@@ vals in the future .
the " 2004 china - 2004 national defense " white paper says that china firmly follows the path of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has been in the past and will not be in any future , nor will it pose a threat to any country .
so far , china has not conducted any military exercises in any other country , nor has it sent troops to other countries .
the beijing university 's international relations institute professor zhu feng said : china and the united states should strengthen their mutual understanding and exchanges through the established channels , increase mutual understanding and mutual trust , and comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century so as to jointly promote world peace and development .

( international observation ) hamas ass@@ em@@ bled to seek breakthrough
xinhua news agency , ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( international observation ) hamas formed a cabinet to seek breakthroughs
xinhua news agency , beijing , june 25 ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) has won the election of the legislative council , how to s@@ ke@@ p@@ tically draw the blueprint of the new government has become the focus of international attention at present .
hamas will implement any new policy , which will directly affect the progress of peace in the next stage , the relevant policy orientation of the parties concerned .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has added more vari@@ ables to the hamas government 's future .
at present , all the palestinians are stepping up consultations to hold consultations on the formation of the cabinet , which involves the difficulties and sensitive points of future developments .
( sub@@ head ) premier posts fl@@ ower
hamas won the bid to form the cabinet , some people in the outside were worried that hamas might meet with the current top leader ab@@ b@@ as .
and , just as egypt is visiting , hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ass@@ ar stressed that hamas is led by hamas , the new palestinian government will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international worries .
the united states and israel explicitly expressed that they would not accept a hamas government that has the power to control the real situation and threatened to hal@@ t economic aid to palestine and to pass tax on it to palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making a flexible strategy .
according to reports , in order to obtain the international recognition as the largest amount , hamas , which was recently ass@@ em@@ bled in egypt , decided to select an independent and islamic university board chairman m@@ ai@@ ul@@ i@@ da al@@ e@@ hu@@ da , to be the new prime minister .
this is the first time that the chinese government has made a decision to raise the level of its foreign exchange reserves .
the palestinian analysts said that the united states will not be able to win the support of the palestinians , whether in the prime minister 's office or in the prime minister 's position , but only in this way can the organization be guaranteed .
( sub@@ head ) power is the most important issue in distribution .
from internal perspective , hamas has formed a cabinet , the biggest challenge facing it is that it lacks sufficient governing experience .
the palestinian " daily " carried a signed article in which he analyzed : through social welfare projects , hamas has gathered in crow@@ ds , but it lacks experience in governing and has no connection with the palestinian national liberation movement , which has the experience in governing .
hamas has been in power for several years since the election , and has set up a political partnership with fat@@ ah , and has jointly established a national coalition government . however , fat@@ ah has not given a positive response to this day .
the fat@@ ah faction currently has a lot of opinions on whether to join the cabinet . a group of people favor participation in the new government , and a group of hamas ref@@ uses to invite hamas to invite him to form a vigorous opposition party in the legislative yuan .
the informed sources said that the chinese government has been very cautious in dealing with the ab@@ b@@ as 's advice .
even though this is the case , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold consultations on the distribution of cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to establish a framework of the legislative yuan , which is beyond the party 's aff@@ ili@@ ated cabinet .
according to reports , hamas also designed a clean - up expert .
in view of the fact that the us and israel have taken a different attitude , the technical expert - type government has no choice but to form a cabinet method to alleviate external pressure .
according to the palestinian " basic law , " the new palestinian leader will be s@@ wor@@ n in on 16 february after he took office in the new legislative committee . he will complete his nomination within three weeks and five weeks .
( sub@@ head ) armed forces should not be allowed to go from the point of departure
hamas ' leaders have been organizing new government to face another challenge .
the united states and israel have adopted a very hard - line attitude , resolutely demanding that hamas give up violence and refuse to take part in the government with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ h@@ ass@@ an stressed on 9 april that armed resistance is the core choice of the organization .
the armed issue is actually a leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of armed forces is two - level issue of management .
hamas has been trying to use democracy and freedom to win the election of the first party in the legislative yuan , thus enabling its subordinate armed forces to be leg@@ alized .
hamas has proposed to include all factions to the palestinian national authority .
the palestinian state has 6@@ 0,000 security personnel .
and , the fat@@ ah and some other organizations have also become weak@@ er .
the responsible person of hamas , who is in charge of organizing the cabinet , must have a thorough understanding of the armed forces that ab@@ b@@ as has managed these armed forces that are self - managed and ration@@ ally distribu@@ te their security management power .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence troops , police and civil defense organs , and other organizations , but the interior ministry of the new government is under the control of ab@@ b@@ as .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , and so far no documents have been made .

the s@@ park continues to play the w@@ as@@ er battle .
v@@ a@@ j@@ pa@@ yee will be turned into a dig@@ it@@ ally pres@@ enting pres@@ tig@@ ious position this year .
if the high - tech coal mine does not implement a system of trans@@ mitting gas from behind , it must be ordered to stop production immediately according to law .
the s@@ park continues to play a role in rectifying and closing down the battle .
we should regard the work of selecting and appointing cadres who have already been publicly announced to the public , and the over 700 coal mines that have recently been reported in various localities to the local authorities for more than 700 coal mines to be closed down to the real end .
we should regard closure as the regular work and constantly close down those enterprises that undermine resources and environment , which do not meet the safety requirements .
the s@@ port of the fu@@ yang coal mine has strengthened the management of the safety of the coal mine .
we should immediately correct the unhealthy tend@@ encies of the small number of large state - owned mining enterprises and the small mines that are in the process of managing and managing chao@@ tic conditions .
in particular , we should pay special attention to the key state - owned coal mines and absolutely not allow super@@ num@@ er@@ ical super@@ num@@ er@@ ical production .
this year 's production safety control indic@@ ators demand that all kinds of accidents in the country drop by 3@@ 3.@@ 0 percent compared with last year , with coal mines falling by 3.@@ 5 percent .
first , the number of deaths of more than 10 people was several times lower .
these control inde@@ xes have been issued to provincial - level people 's governments , and all localities are implementing in various levels to grass - roots and enterprises .
the statistics show that in 2005 , the number of coal mine accidents in china was 5,@@ 9@@ 86 , a decrease of 0.@@ 7 percent over the same period last year .
however , one time after another , the accident of the more than 10 people killed was on the rise , with the number of dead people increasing by 6@@ 6.@@ 6 percent over the same period last year .

( winter olympics ) . xing@@ ye
xinhua news agency , du@@ an , february 17 , du@@ tch reporters to visit china on february 17
xinhua news agency , beijing , march 15 ,
although italy 's repeated orders have indicated that the re@@ vit@@ alization of the winter olympics has been un@@ covered by the use of stimul@@ ants during the winter olympics , they are likely to face a la@@ v@@ age of j@@ ail , but judging from various circumstances , the situation is not very likely to occur in the main cur@@ ve of the ar@@ c 's first case of stimul@@ ants scand@@ al in winter olympics .
the du@@ an winter olympics was bl@@ own out on 16 april .
the following day , the international olympic committee announced that it had sent le@@ ov@@ a to the winter olympics . she had been awarded the winter di@@ agr@@ ams at the winter olympics olympics .
the international winter season is scheduled to be held in the same day .
the chinese government has always provided the i@@ oc with the stipul@@ ation that athletes have been found using stimul@@ ants in the olympic games and will be abol@@ ished and depriv@@ ed of the quali@@ fication for the games , but they are not subject to legal sanctions .
however , according to italian law , the athletes carrying and using stimul@@ ants bel@@ ongs to the criminal act , and the judicial organs have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants , and to try the law with one heart and one mind is still facing three months to three years of imprisonment .
last december , the i@@ oc and the italian government reached a consensus after a year of hard barg@@ aining .
after the i@@ oc 's unremitting efforts , italy has made great achievements in the four days before the opening of the winter olympics , and has promised that the police will not enter the olympic village to search the athle@@ te 's place during the winter olympics games , but the athletes with positive medic@@ ation will still accept the investigation by the italian procuratorial organ .
some reports say that the italian government is monitoring the winter olympics in winter , per@@ es , an official of the italian government , has sent le@@ gen@@ ov@@ a 's stimul@@ ant to the du@@ tch procuratorial organ .
however , the i@@ oc and the per@@ e@@ gr@@ ine himself have not confirmed the incident .
russia 's winter season is the last one of the two teams in the world , and the two teams are now in the process of the chinese nation 's modernization .
zeng qinghong , who had been in charge of the world anti - d@@ oping agency for many years , held that once the le@@ gen@@ ds were sent back to china , this incident could eventually be very difficult .
history : the chinese government has always attached great importance to the friendly cooperation between the i@@ oc and the italian government in the winter olympics , shi said , adding that even if the italian procuratorial organ really interven@@ es in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous italian forecast for the use of stimul@@ ants in their athletes ,
therefore , the italian ant@@ a society 's senior reporter , le@@ i@@ e , said that sending le@@ ap@@ ov@@ a into the prison was very rare in the mic@@ r@@ ow@@ ave , and the most likely one was a fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although italy 's court could be in@@ war@@ ded , the italian police did not have the ability to send the le@@ ov@@ a back to prison .
if the le@@ ov@@ a ref@@ uses to accept the verdic@@ t , italy has no way to take it .
