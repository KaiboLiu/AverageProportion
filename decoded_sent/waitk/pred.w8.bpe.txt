( newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings ) shanghai : part - time staff and college graduates become the mainstay of the hours of work
beijing , february 7 ( xinhua ) the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau announced on the 6@@ th the latest monthly wages for workers in 2006 , which stood at 120 , an increase of 11 as compared with the previous one , and 120 of the original jobs were on the decline .
according to an estimate by a relevant expert from the shanghai municipal labor and social security bureau , shanghai 's employees have already exceeded 1 million .
according to a report in china youth daily , college graduates and part - time workers are the major components of the work@@ force .
through the direct investigation of nearly 8,000 hours of work , more than half of the people are part - time workers , with a share of 5@@ 1.@@ 1 percent .
the cultural level of part - time workers is generally relatively high , mainly for the work of relatively strong technical skills , such as transl@@ ation jobs , the proportion of part - time workers , as high as 8@@ 1.7 % , and the number of fit@@ ness workers is 6@@ 1.6 % .
high income is a major reason for many people to work at the same time .
it is understood that the monthly income of individual posts can reach tens of thousands of yuan , and it will be difficult to find it hard to trans@@ late it , and the monthly income of job posts can be more than 2,000 yuan , such as part - time treasury bonds .
to satisfy their personal interest and to expand their knowledge is also a major reason for their part - time work .
for example , in a certain enterprise , mr. gu , who is the manager of the human resources department , will take a few hours a week to handle the financial accounts of a foreign representative office .
mr ko@@ o said that the biggest benefit for part - time jobs was to keep up his knowledge and to involve another area , of course , the income of 2000 yuan per month also had a certain amount of in@@ duc@@ tion .
as some hours of work are low in employment , and their work forms are flexible and free , they are gradually favor@@ ed by many graduates who are currently seeking jobs , and 14@@ percent of them are graduates of tertiary and secondary schools who have been in employment for nearly three years .
at the beginning i did not want to work for an hour , but after doing a few months , i felt it was better than the nine n@@ ights to work .
after gradu@@ ating from college students , xiao huang 's job was not satisfactory . finally , he hung up a famous guesthouse and played a background music with pi@@ an@@ o .
i am quite satisfied with the current work , and i am 100 yuan per hour , and my environment is good . what i want to do now is to find a few hours more .
it is understood that an hour job has become a job experience of some graduates who are currently in the job - seeking process , and have enhanced their skills in communication , thus increasing their social vis@@ u@@ alization .
the graduates are mainly engaged in the work of making their jobs more knowledge and skilled , such as highly professional trans@@ lat@@ or posts , strong e@@ po@@ ch@@ al and performing arts , with a share of 2@@ 2.@@ 1 % and 2@@ 6.@@ 8 % respectively .
some of the jobs are not high , such as food promo@@ ters , cas@@ hi@@ ers , and unemployed personnel can be appointed through simple training .
the number of employees in the industry is 3@@ 9@@ -@@ 7 percent , with the number of employees in the retail sector as high as 6@@ 8.@@ 4 percent , and the proportion of food and be@@ ver@@ age in the total number of unemployed workers has become an important channel for employment for the unemployed .

the report , which lasted as long as 92 p@@ ages , used three phr@@ ases to explain china 's military strength and the countermeasures that the united states should adopt , for 15 times the report directly mentioned the two terms of china 's ta@@ ke@@ off or china 's rise , saying that as a major and emerging power , china has the greatest potential for military competition with the united states , and if the united states does not have countermeasures , it will very likely develop destruc@@ tive technology in the traditional us military sphere ,
professor yao yun@@ zhu , research fellow of the world military studies department of the chinese academy of military sciences , said that although the us senior officials have repeatedly expressed similar views , this is the first time that the united states has proposed in its national defense strategy that china is most likely to pose a military challenge to the united states .
the report for the first time clearly regards russia as a new strategic oppon@@ ent , especially the so - called china 's military threat , as a matter of concern .
major general peng guang@@ qian , a resear@@ cher at the chinese academy of military sciences ,
it is no@@ te@@ worthy that the " four - year defense assessment report " has officially been submitted to the congress on the same day , us president bush has also submitted to the congress the 2007 government budget , of which the national defense budget is $ 4@@ 3@@ 9.@@ 3 - billion .
if the united states is to add the military action budget for iraq and afghanistan , the national defense budget for 2007 will exceed $ 500 billion , creating a new historical high , and peng guang@@ qian said that it is almost equal to all other countries ' military spending .
peng guang@@ qian said : the us method of creating the threat of other countries reflects the consistent style of the pentagon 's creating enemies , and its real purpose is to win more national defense funds and to fish for greater profits for the vast us arms and industries .
experts say that compared with the huge military spending of the united states , china 's defense spending is quite limited .
he has participated in several military experts ' written in china 's national defense white papers , saying that since the 1990 s , with economic development , china 's national defense spending has increased , but the proportion of the national financial expenditures for the same period has generally declined .
official statistics show that compared with 1979 , china 's national defense spending accounts for nearly 10 percent of the country 's financial expenditures for the same period .
china 's national defense spending in 2005 will be 2@@ 4.@@ 6@@ 56 billion yuan , just about one - tenth of that of the united states , and its per capita military spending will be only about one - tenth of that of the united states , with the per capita military spending of servicemen accounting for about one - third of the us military .
the united states ' land area is r@@ oughly equal to china 's territory , but its military spending is so big , and who is military forces that exceed the legitimate defense needs is a met@@ ap@@ h@@ or .
peng guang@@ qian said :
zhang yan , director of the research department of the china arms control and disarmament association , said that the us side should obj@@ ectively evalu@@ ate china 's military construction and that china 's peaceful development does not mean that china and the united states will become their military ri@@ vals in the future .
the white paper " china 's national defense in 2004 " says that china firmly follows the road of peaceful development and practices a defensive national defense policy .
china has never been able to make a com@@ e@@ back , and will not pose a threat to any country in the future .
so far , china has not established military bases in any other country , nor has it sent a single soldier to other countries , while the united states has more than 100 military bases overseas , and has deployed more than 100,000 troops in asia alone .
professor zhu feng of the institute of international relations at pe@@ king university said : china and the united states should increase communication and exchanges through the established channels , enhance mutual understanding and trust , comprehensively promote the constructive and cooperative relations between china and the united states in the new century , and jointly promote world peace and development .

hamas cabinet to break new cabinet
ram@@ al@@ lah , february 9 ( xinhua ) the hamas cabinet is formed to seek a breakthrough
xinhua news agency , wang ha@@ o@@ yue ,
the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the election of the legislative council , how to draw up a blueprint for the new government has become the focus of attention in the world today .
what kind of new policy the hamas will pursue will directly affect the relevant policy orientation of the parties in the peace process .
at the same time , the resistance attitude of the united states and israel has also added vari@@ ables to the prospect of the hamas government .
at present , all sides in palestine are stepping up consultations to reach a consensus on the difficulties and sensitive points in forming the cabinet that involve the development of the future situation .
the prime minister 's post has taken place and which home ?
after hamas won the right to form the cabinet , some people in the outside world are worried that there may be differences between hamas 's prime minister and ab@@ b@@ as , the current supreme leader .
in addition , hamas leader m@@ ash@@ al , who is currently visiting egypt , has emphasized that the new palestinian government , which is led by hamas , will not recognize israel , and this hard - line signal has also aggrav@@ ated international concern .
the united states and israel have explicitly expressed their dis@@ approval of a hamas government that has the power of truth and threatened to stop the economic aid to palestine and to transfer tax from palestine .
however , this does not prevent hamas from making flexible strategic adjustments , and the election of independent figures is a compromise policy .
it is reported that to maxim@@ ize international recognition , the hamas leaders at home and abroad who have gathered in egypt recently decided to elect an independent s@@ ak@@ hal@@ il@@ i , chairman of the board of directors of the islamic university of egypt , as the new prime minister .
this move has not received any response from the relevant parties .
palestinian analysts said that no matter who the prime minister 's post will take , the most crucial thing is that the prime minister candidate should try his best to play down the hard color of hamas and ensure the success of the cabinet .
how to distribu@@ te power ?
in the internal aspect , the greatest challenge facing hamas in forming a cabinet is the lack of sufficient experience in governance .
the palestinian daily newspaper carried an analysis that hamas has gathered people 's minds through social welfare projects , but it lacks experience in governance and is in opposition to the palestinian national liberation movement ( fat@@ ah ) , which has the experience of being in power .
after the election , hamas proposed establishing political partnership with fat@@ ah , and jointly establishing a national coalition government , fat@@ ah has not responded positively to this .
at present , there are different opinions within fat@@ ah on whether or not they will be admitted into the cabinet , one faction advocates joining the new government , and the other is ref@@ using to invite hamas , and the legislative yuan is willing to make a big g@@ est@@ ure of opposition .
the informed source pointed out that , with the persu@@ asion of ab@@ b@@ as , fat@@ ah gradually ten@@ ds to join the new government .
even so , hamas and fat@@ ah will also hold talks on the distribution of their cabinet posts .
in addition , another way is to set up a legislative yuan cabinet that is divor@@ ced from the party 's aff@@ iliation .
it is reported that hamas has also designed a clean and honest government , but the specific list of the list is unknown .
in view of the attitude of the united states and israel , the technical expert - type government is no longer a form of cabinet that can reduce external pressure .
according to the basic law of palestine , the number of nom@@ ine@@ es to be elected by the new legislative council on 16 march will be completed in three weeks to five weeks after the inauguration of the new legislative council .
what course of the armed forces will follow ?
the weapons in hamas are another thor@@ ny problem facing the establishment of a new government .
the united states and israel have adopted a very hard line , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and refuse to join the government with guns .
hamas leader ma@@ ha@@ th@@ ir emphasized on 9 april that armed resistance is the result of the organization 's strategy .
the armed forces issue actually includes the leg@@ ality of weapons and the ownership of the armed forces .
hamas 's election of the first largest party in the legislative council through democracy and freedom has won international recognition , making the armed faction of its subordinate to the ru@@ th@@ less brigade of q@@ am@@ do , the same way of bringing it into the government 's security organs .
hamas has proposed the idea of unifying all the armed forces into the palestinian national authority , but it has not received extensive support and has also been met with the criticism of the islamic ji@@ had ( ji@@ had ) of palestine .
palestine now has more than 6@@ 0,000 security personnel , and the overwhelming majority of them are from the fat@@ ah camp .
moreover , there are also some armed factions under the lo@@ ose organization relations , such as the al-@@ aq@@ sa marty@@ rs ' brigade , the fr@@ ag@@ ile of the al-@@ fa@@ hd , and others .
hamas , who is responsible for the formation of the cabinet , must reach agreement with ab@@ b@@ as on how to manage these armed forces that are in their own hands and reason@@ ably distribu@@ te security management authority .
according to local media reports , ab@@ b@@ as inten@@ ds to take charge of security and intelligence units , while the police and civil defense departments are under the control of the interior ministry of the new government .
however , all parties are still holding consultations on this sensitive issue , so far no further documents have been made .

at present , we are making preparations for the establishment of the third ant@@ arc@@ tic station , and also china 's first inland inland inland station in the ant@@ arc@@ tic .
sun zhi@@ hui said :

according to a recent report by the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill , requiring that the american broadcasting industry must stop broadcasting the current simul@@ ated television signals on february 17 , 200@@ 9 , and can only send digital signals .

japanese researchers develop new highly efficient kid@@ ney
tokyo , february 13 ( xinhua ) japanese researchers at the east china sea university have developed a biological - pow@@ ered kid@@ ney system which not only has the same functions as human kid@@ ney but also has the ability to retain the functions of material ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents , which are small in size and easy to trans@@ plant , and is expected to bring for@@ giv@@ eness to the ne@@ pal@@ ese patients with in - depth research .
according to a report recently published by the ni@@ k@@ on industrial news , the newly developed bi@@ om@@ ass kid@@ ney is mainly composed of two parts , and some are made of the blood of the d@@ na and the d@@ ir@@ ty of the d@@ na , and some of the are used to return to blood trans@@ fu@@ sion from the water level of the lieutenant general and the hydr@@ og@@ en base , and other factors that are used to return to blood trans@@ fu@@ sion .
the amount of d@@ ir@@ ty and d@@ ir@@ ty se@@ ed in the sky was made from the middle and the lower levels of the d@@ na , and the inside side of the th@@ in pip@@ e was filled with ur@@ ine cell@@ s with the functions of dec@@ om@@ mis@@ si@@ oning .
this kind of sk@@ in cell can make the number of diseases caused by multiple blood penetr@@ ation , and can be thoroughly analyzed as the cause of the gen@@ e@@ tic factors being di@@ agn@@ os@@ ed into hydr@@ og@@ en ther@@ ap@@ y and returning to blood , and at the same time , it can also make the sol@@ ar and mineral - related materials needed for physical health enter blood again .
in the past , the difference between human - made kid@@ ne@@ ys reli@@ ed on the se@@ epage to fil@@ tr@@ ation of waste cannot completely eliminate it , and it is not equipped with the function of returning the ar@@ ter@@ ic ac@@ id and other ing@@ re@@ di@@ ents to blood .
researchers used go@@ ats to carry out experiments on trans@@ plant biological human kid@@ ney , and the use of pi@@ g on the c@@ w@@ f in the middle - air sil@@ k line of arti@@ ficial kid@@ ney .
two weeks later , researchers confirmed that human - made kid@@ ney has been able to play its functions .

the south african government hopes to lower the crime rate to zero and hopes that every one of the foreigners working in south africa will be able to obtain the legal and citizens ' full protection , said the minister .

because many chinese do not understand english , they have cash in their bodies , and they are more pr@@ one to become victims who seek financial attacks .

( winter olympic games , stimul@@ ant ) news analysis : the dispatch of the li@@ u@@ j@@ a incident may not be over - settled .
tur@@ in , february 17 ( xinhua ) the dispatch of the li@@ tig@@ ation of the child may be un@@ settled
xinhua news agency , gao peng , ding ying
although italy repeatedly claimed that the tur@@ in olympic games were un@@ covered and used stimul@@ ants during the tur@@ in olympics , all athletes might face the j@@ ail pl@@ ung@@ ing , but judging from various circumstances , this kind of situation is not likely to happen in this winter olympic games 's first scand@@ al of stimul@@ ant , and the two russian bas@@ ke@@ t@@ ball players , the main players , the two of them , were on the list .
the du@@ ling@@ dong olympic association announced its first ever d@@ oping scand@@ al since its opening on 16 april . or@@ g par@@ ov@@ a was found to have used a number of banned drug cards .
the international olympic committee announced the following day that the dispatch of le@@ ov@@ a was already out of the winter olympic games , and she received a silver med@@ al in the women 's 15 - kilome@@ ter individual tour@@ na@@ ment at the winter olympic games this year .
the world winter team made a decision on the same day on the same day to punish the li@@ pp@@ a ban for two years .
the international olympic committee has always been providing that athletes are found to use stimul@@ ants at the olympic games , and will be canc@@ elled and depriv@@ ed of their compe@@ ten@@ cy , but they are not punished by the law .
however , according to the italian law , athletes are allowed to bring and use stimul@@ ants because of their crimes . the judiciary has the right to directly arrest and investigate the athletes who use stimul@@ ants . the court of final appeal is still faced with a period of three months to three years .
in december last year , the international olympic committee and the italian government , after a year of barg@@ aining , finally reached an agreement , which both sides agreed to handle the use of stimul@@ ants by athletes in line with the italian law during the winter olympics .
with the unremitting efforts of the international olympic committee , italy made a concession four days before the opening of the winter olympics , pled@@ ging that the police would not enter the olympic village to search for the athletes ' places of residence , but the athletes with positive drug scre@@ ens will still accept investigation by the italian procuratorial organs .
it is reported that the italian government supervis@@ ed the du@@ ent@@ in winter olympic games , per@@ st@@ an , who has handed over the d@@ oping incident to the du@@ ling procuratorial organs .
however , the international olympic committee and pe@@ ter s@@ and@@ y have not yet confirmed this .
russian winter team team di@@ an@@ dr@@ ov announced at noon on the 17@@ th that the dispatch of the par@@ ov@@ a had left tur@@ in and returned to china .
the world anti - d@@ oping agency , which has been in office for many years , believes that once the par@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ar is sent back to china , it will be possible to have a chance to get a free hand .
shi k@@ ang@@ cheng said that the international olympic committee and the italian government have never had a thorough settlement of the issue of anti - d@@ oping in the winter olympics , and even the italian procuratorial organs are really involved in this matter , it is hard to say .
according to the previous practice of the italian law of the use of stimul@@ ant cases for athletes in italy , the he@@ avi@@ est pen@@ alties for those who have been banned are just the two years of imprisonment suspended execution .
therefore , p@@ ie@@ i , a senior italian reporter at the an@@ th@@ ony news agency , said that the possibility of le@@ av@@ a entering the prison was small , and the top was fine .
pi@@ er@@ re also said that although the italian court could be held in a abs@@ ence of trial , it was impossible for the italian police to send their li@@ tig@@ ants back to the country to serve the sentence .
if a prison@@ er is sent to the court , it will be impossible for the italian side to take her .
